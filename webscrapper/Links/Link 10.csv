Joke Silva debunks rumor of husband Olu Jacobs death,"Veteran Nollywood thespian Joke Silva, the wife of veteran actor, Olu Jacob’s has debunked the rumour of her husband’s death, saying he is much alive and doing just fine.


This is the second time rumours about the death of the legendary Nigerian actor will be making the rounds on social media.


Joke Silva in her reply to an sms inquiry by our reporter replied “My husband is alive and doing just fine.”


A close source to the family (name withheld), told Vanguard on phone that the AGN President told him that he spoke with the wife today and they spoke for over one hour without any mention of such news.


“Somebody who has lost a husband cannot be that chatty and Gail on phone,” the source said.




Also, Betty Irabor, an associate of the family has also debunked the rumour.


The final nail on the coffin of the rumour was a broadcast by Channels TV where they were seen speaking with the actor who said he is alive and in fact preparing to go to Ikoyi Club this evening.

Accra to host inaugural Green Film Festival,"Accra is set to host the inaugural Green Film Festival (GFF) from October 11th to 12th, 2024, across multiple locations in the city.


This two-day event aims to merge the evocative power of storytelling with urgent environmental themes, fostering a profound connection between its participants and the natural world.


A New Era of Environmental Awareness Through Film


The Green Film Festival is more than just a film festival; It's a movement designed to inspire sustainable living and ecological responsibility from individuals and institutions. 


By showcasing a curated selection of short impactful films that explore the impact of climate change and environmental conservation, GFF seeks to enlighten and challenge viewers, prompting them to reevaluate their environmental impact.




The festival's films, workshop and immersive experience will explore five (5) significant themes crucial to our planet's future Biodiversity, Activism, Food, Climate Displacement and Wildlife Conservation.


The festival is also supported by key figures in the media and climate ecosystems, including the Chief Executive Officer of the EIB Network, Nathan Kwabena Anokye Addisi, popularly known as Bola Ray, Vice-Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC's) Working Group Prof Nana Ama Browne Klutse among others.


Festival Highlights


1. Daily Screenings: Attendees can look forward to daily screenings of 15 to 30-minute films, each selected for its ability to provoke thought and inspire climate action.




2. Interactive Workshops: Post-screening discussions and workshops will guide participants from awareness to practical action, empowering them to incorporate sustainable practices into their lives.


3. Eco-Themed Celebration: The festival culminates in a massive eco-themed park event, celebrating sustainability through arts, sculpture, music, and a grand film screening.


“The Green Film Festival is a critical initiative to mobilize our community around the pressing issues of climate change and environmental sustainability. Through the power of film, we can drive awareness and action, encouraging individuals and institutions to adopt sustainable practices.


This festival is a testament to the role of creative media in shaping a more resilient and ace-conscious future."" Isaac Aboah, Festival Co-director.




“Our world faces unprecedented environmental challenges, from climate change to biodiversity loss. The Green Film Festival serves as a powerful platform to amplify these urgent messages through the art of storytelling. By leveraging film's persuasive power, we aim to inspire action and challenge local and international organisations to lead by example and promote environmental stewardship."" - Joshua Amponsem, Festival Co-director.


Who Should Attend? The Green Film Festival welcomes filmmakers, environmental enthusiasts, and the general public.


Whether you're a storyteller looking to make a difference, an advocate for sustainability, or simply curious about ecological issues, GFF offers a unique platform to engage with like-minded individuals and become part of a global movement towards a sustainable future.

We dated for two months before he proposed  Actress Sharon Ooja shares love story,"Nollywood actress, Sharon Ooja, who married her partner, Ugo Nwoke, in Abuja on Thursday, has shared her journey into marriage.


In an interview with Bella Naija, Ooja revealed that she dated for two and a half months before her husband proposed to her.


Sharon said her sister introduced her to Nwoke, and despite initial reservations, they connected deeply.


She said, “My love story is one that I’ll say is short of a miracle. I had just recovered from what I considered the worst heartbreak of my life, and I was filming, and my sister had said to me a friend of hers wanted to speak to me and I was like I wasn’t in the mood.

“I didn’t want to talk to anybody. Anyway, she gives this person my number and he is really smart. I was like, who is this person, and we probably didn’t speak as much as we should.


“Months passed he kept on trying to reach me, and I was like, this guy is really persistent. We kept on having really cute conversations, and one day, there was just one conversation that struck me. We spoke for about three hours. I was like I think I like this guy.

“I travelled and realised that he hadn’t called me in like two days, I asked 'why didn’t you call me?' And he said 'you told me you were going to go out and have fun'. I was like yeah, I’m single and he said 'I didn’t I want you to be single no more'.""




“We dated for literally two-and-a-half months, and I was engaged in the third month. And we married two months after there.”

Artwork now most valuable Harry Potter item ever sold,"An original watercolour illustration has become the most valuable Harry Potter item ever sold - fetching $1.9m (£1.5m) at auction in the US.


The artwork for the first edition of JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sold for more than three times the expected price.


It was first auctioned in 2001, before the book series was complete, for £85,750 (about $108,000 at current exchange rates).


""This is really the first visualization of Harry and the wizarding world,"" said Kalika Sands from Sotheby's auction house.


The artwork had been expected to sell for between $400,000 and $600,000, which Sotheby's said was the highest pre-sale estimate for a Harry Potter-related work.




It took nearly 10 minutes for the four-way bidding to finish on Wednesday. The identity of the buyer was not revealed.


Thomas Taylor was just 23 when he painted the iconic illustration in 1997


The artist behind the illustration, Thomas Taylor, was only 23 years old in 1997 when he created the iconic image of Harry Potter standing in front of the Hogwarts Express - the train that would lead the young bespectacled wizard into the magical world.


It was done using concentrated watercolours with black pencil outlines and took him two days to finish.


Mr Taylor, who grew up in Wales, was one of the first people to read the manuscript for the original Harry Potter book, which went on to sell millions of copies and spawned a lucrative franchise including movies and theme parks.




Ms Sands said the difference in auction price between 2001, when only four of the seven books in the series were published, and now reflected just how popular author Rowling's creation had become.


""In the intervening decades, it's been extraordinary to see just the conclusion of Harry's story, but also how the Harry Potter franchise has taken off, and in that time, new generations have come to appreciate Harry and his journey as well.""

"People are threatening to kill Judy, hurt our children- Yul Edochie alleges","Controversial Nollywood actor and pastor, Yul Edochie, has announced an alleged plot by some persons to kill his second wife, Judy Austin, and harm their two children.


In November 2021, Judy welcomed a son named Star Munachimso with Yul and on 21st April 2022, the actor publicly unveiled her as his second wife.


Before the announcement, he married May for over 17 years, a union that produced four children: a girl and three boys.


May, who did not seem pleased with the union, revealed that her husband paid Judy’s bride price on 24 April 2022 without informing her and filed for a divorce in August 2023. Details of the court proceedings had been kept hush.


After he went public with news of his marriage to Judy, he fell out on social media with his fans and earned a large following of critics and sympathisers alike.







At the same time, he and Judy have also become the butt of internet jokes, especially on Facebook, where they host live videos and a mini-reality show of their personal lives.


But, these activities have earned him some die-hard enemies; at least, that is what his recent social media post suggests.


In a recent post, Yul claimed that those behind the plot created social media platforms to bully his fans, friends, and business associates.


Threat to life


He stated that the group, operating on WhatsApp, has been bullying and harassing others, even posting his home address and threatening his children and partner.




Yul said he has reported the matter to the police and is offering a one million naira reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.


He wrote on Instagram: “I heard a group of jobless and foolish people formed a WhatsApp group and social media pages, and they’re using them to threaten my fans, friends, and business associates.


Bullying is unacceptable to me or anyone else. I have reported the matter to the police. If anyone calls or texts you to threaten you, please record the call, copy the number and text, and send it to me so I can forward it to the police for tracking them.


“I heard they went as far as posting my house address on their platform & threatening to hurt my children & kill Judy. They have crossed the line. You can not sit in your house & tell another person how to live their life. God punish all of you. I will get you all.




“I’m offering N1 million and more to anyone who can provide helpful information about them to aid their arrest. To all my fans & friends all over the world, please assist me in apprehending these psychos. I thank you all for your love & support. God bless you. Cyberbullying is unacceptable.’’


He urged anyone receiving threatening calls or texts to record and forward the communication to him so he could assist the police in tracking down the perpetrators.


Yul called on everyone to join him in fighting this behaviour and ensuring that those responsible face consequences.

"I dont regret going into politics, Ill do it again  Funke Akindele","Nigerian filmmaker Funke Akindele has revealed reasons she will re-contest for political office.


The PDP governorship candidate in Lagos, Olajide Adediran, aka Jandor, picked Ms Akindele as his running mate in the 2023 general election.


During an interview on Arise TV’s Perspectives show, shared on YouTube Saturday, the mother-of-two spoke about political career.


The 46-year-old said: “So getting into politics was a big one for me. I enjoyed it, and I will do it again. I run a studio which I’ve been running since 2000. 


""I’ve been producing and working with many people, from crew members to cast. I have a Jenifa Foundation where we help nurture talent, and I bring on board many young talents.""




""We train them in filmmaking; they’re always on set, whether in the hair department, makeup, lights, or camera. It’s something I love doing—empowering young people and nurturing talent. 


""Some say Auntie is so strict, but she draws you closer when she’s strict, next to me. I love to uplift people; I can do it even better if I get into a larger space.


“For me, to have been doing it for years, let me try something big. Many young people complain, ‘We don’t have this’ or ‘This is going wrong.’ Let me come in to represent the youth. That is why I wanted to do it. 


""And that’s why I got into politics. Yes, I enjoyed every part of it. It was quite challenging, but I enjoyed every part of it. I felt so good representing the young people. It was challenging.”




She stated that changing Nigeria couldn’t be achieved in a day or four years, but political officeholders could plan startup initiatives.


Challenges


Ms Akindele recounted how she was accused of running for deputy governor because of popularity, money, and other personal gains.


She stated that during her campaign, she learned that people were going through a lot, hence the need to stand up for them.


“I love that private sectors are coming in, supporting the government. That is why we should focus more on supporting the government. Criticism is good, but how can you also support it? As a youth, how can you help yourself? What is that special gift in you that you have? You need to stand up and do something for yourself. So, getting into politics was a big one for me,” she said.




Reflecting on her challenges during the campaign, she said, “You had to hit the road, keep talking to people, and keep persuading them that you could do it. You had to delve into their issues and uncover the real problems people were facing—not just surface ones. 


""That’s when you realise people are enduring a lot in the country. You had to jot it all down and brainstorm how to offer solutions. It wasn’t something that happened overnight. You couldn’t just come in and declare, ‘I’m this, I’m that.’”


Jenifa Foundation


Furthermore, Ms Akindele maintained that she established the Jenifa Foundation to nurture young talent and build youth skills for a better Nigeria.


“Jenifa is so passionate about young people. In Jenifa’s diary, she has a salon; she’s always bringing in people. Jenifa believes in nurturing talent. I created the Jenifa Foundation, where we bring up young people. We train them in skills acquisition and vocational skills acquisition.




“We train them in filmmaking, which is more practical, and believing makes them believe in themselves. Confidence is essential. When people tell you you can’t do it, you must prove you can. You’re going to get a lot of negatives, a lot of no’s. People are negative out there,” she added.


She urged young, talented individuals to focus on pursuing their dreams amidst the storm.


According to her, they needed to be more sensitive about information consumption and shun procrastination, which she described as a big problem.



Films


The actress and director revealed that there will be a sequel to ‘A Tribe Called Judah’, her 2023 film that grossed over N1 billion at the box office.




She thanked God and her fans, acknowledging that she initially doubted the movie’s potential for broad acceptance.


Ms Akindele highlighted that her upcoming film ‘Finding Me’ explores the journey of self-discovery for individuals.


“Who are you? What do you want? How do you want to live your life? Do you want to live your life based on what people say, based on what the family says? That is what ‘Finding Me’ is all about.”


Ms Akindele, a lawyer, announced that she will be venturing into biopics and epic movies in 2026.

I want to continue acting till 90  Kanayo,"Nollywood veteran Kanayo O Kanayo has revealed his ambition to remain active in the film industry until he reaches the age of 90.


The 62-year-old actor shared his aspirations in a preview of an upcoming episode of the Honest Bunch podcast.


Kanayo also voiced concerns about what he sees as the “influx of untalented women” into Nollywood.


The actor and producer did not shy away from addressing other issues plaguing the industry, including drug abuse and homosexuality.


“Many girls are desperate to act. You don’t come to Nollywood to learn how to act. Acting is natural. If it’s not in you, go and sell crayfish,” Kanayo asserted.




He also highlighted the presence of drug use among actors and what he referred to as “unnatural” behaviours, specifically referring to homosexuality.


“For men who have unnatural… When I say unnatural in law, you should understand it to be when man dey sleep with man and all those things. (E dey happen for the industry?) Of course,” Kanayo remarked.


“Are you aware most artistes are on drugs?” he added, calling for a purge of certain elements from the industry. “I want a situation where at 70, 75, 80, 90, I will still be acting.”


This is not the first time Kanayo has spoken out about the challenges within Nollywood.




Recall last year, he claimed some individuals joined the industry to “sell sex” and warned against the movie industry becoming a platform for those involved in the sex trade and homosexuality.


Kanayo also recently introduced his first son, Clinton, to filmmaking, indicating a desire to pass on his legacy to the next generation.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

How Afrobeats made it to the very top of Glastonbury,"On Sunday evening, Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy will fire up Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage.


While he has played at the UK's biggest festival before, this is his first time on the famous main stage, which has been Glastonbury's focal point for decades.


Fellow Afrobeats star Ayra Starr also performed on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, while Tems had a slot on the Other Stage.


From West Africa to the world stage, Afrobeats has risen rapidly to dominate playlists and radio.


On Spotify, the Afrobeats genre has grown by 1,200% since 2017.




But with its artists now performing at the very top of the UK's biggest festival, it feels like another threshold has been crossed.


""It's our time,"" Starr told BBC News. ""It’s been a long time coming and we deserve this.""


So what is Afrobeats all about, and how has it taken off?


West African origins




Ayra Starr took to Pyramid Stage on Saturday


The genre has its roots in Nigeria and Ghana, and started rising rapidly in popularity in the 2010s, with early hits from artists like Fuse ODG and D'banj.


It is not to be confused with ""Afrobeat"" - minus the ""s"". That is a movement created in the 1960s and 1970s by the artist and activist Fela Kuti.


Kuti's musical style is a fusion of traditional African rhythms with funk, jazz and highlife.


Coincidentally, Kuti himself played at Glastonbury in 1984, and this year, his son Femi Kuti played on the Pyramid Stage.




But Afrobeats, with an ""s"", is a completely different sound. It is generally seen as a fusion of traditional West African musical styles with Western pop, rap and dancehall.


""Afrobeat spoke to a much older audience,"" said DJ Edu, who hosts BBC 1Xtra's AfroSounds show.


""Afrobeats has been driven a lot by social media,"" he said, adding that young people, travelling to different parts of the world, also helped spread the sound.


Burna Boy, Tiwa Savage and Wizkid are among the genre's superstars


There were challenges, of course. DJ Edu said that a lot of people who started out making Afrobeats were not clued up about the music industry.




""They were just kids making music from their bedrooms, not worrying about streaming or royalties. That was the big problem, there was no structure,"" he said.


But as bigger artists started making headway, younger ones were able to learn from them and chart their own route in the industry, he added.


DJs in the UK started fusing pop music with Nigerian and Ghanaian beats, taking the sounds to new audiences.


Songs from the genre regularly started crossing into the mainstream, with its first big global success being the release of Oliver Twist by the artist D'banj in 2012.




The song made the top 10 on the official UK Singles Chart and was number two in the UK R&B Charts.


It is often described as the first time Afrobeats really took hold in the UK.


Rise in popularity


From then on, Afrobeats quickly spread around the world. It has often been described as one of Africa's biggest cultural exports.


""We've been waiting for the globalisation of Afrobeats, and it's happening now,"" Starr said, speaking ahead of her Glastonbury performance.




""But it’s not just what you're seeing today. It's years and generations of musicians and hard work that’s made it what it is now.""


TikTok and YouTube - where many people discover new music - have played a big part in taking Afrobeats to new audiences in the UK, the US and beyond.


One example is Nigerian artist CKay's Love Nwantiti, which went viral on the app and became the most Shazam-ed song in the world in 2021.


Songs by singers Davido, Burna Boy and Wizkid have also gained popularity through their TikTok dance routines.




Collaborations with the likes of Beyoncé, Drake and Justin Bieber have also helped lift the Afrobeats scene to new heights.


For example, Drake featured Wizkid on 2016's One Dance - which helped put a spotlight on the singer and the genre he represents.


In the summer of 2023, Burna Boy made history when he became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK in front of a sold-out crowd of 60,000 at the London Stadium.


Tems played on The Other Stage at Glastonbury this year


""The genre's rise has been nothing short of meteoric,"" Sheniece Charway, YouTube's artists' relations manager for black music and culture, told BBC News.


""Afrobeats has ignited a global revolution, and it's captivating trajectory shows no sign of slowing.""


""Popular music is pop music and Afrobeats has become popular music globally,"" she added.


""We are seeing the likes of Wizkid, Libianca and Burna Boy all having global success, which shows that their audience is everywhere.""


In a sign of the genre's huge global popularity, it has been included as a category in a number of major awards.


Billboard in the US recently added an Afrobeats category, with Burna Boy and fellow Nigerian star Rema both recognised at the event in November.


Burna Boy, who has also been the recipient of a Grammy, dedicated his award ""to Africa and every artist coming out of Africa now"".


Rema and Selena Gomez won the Best Afrobeats award for Calm Down at last year's MTV Video Music Awards


Meanwhile Rema won a gong for his near-ubiquitous song Calm Down, which has smashed multiple streaming and chart records.


The track, which featured Selena Gomez, became the first African artist-led track to hit a billion streams on Spotify.


Accepting the Billboard award for best Afrobeats song, Rema thanked his fans and called the prize ""a celebration of unity and the global domination of Afrobeats"".


The MTV VMAs, Grammys and American Music Awards have also recently added the category of best Afrobeats.


DJ Edu says this recognition has meant a lot to Afrobeats artists.


""[It] shows there's a light at the end of the tunnel for this music,"" he said.


People are 'infatuated'


For Starr, part of the reason for Afrobeats' huge growth is the fact the sound is overwhelmingly positive.


""Afrobeats is enjoyment. You have to enjoy yourself, you have to be at a club or at a party to make the music that people want to dance to. And we like to dance,"" she said.


""I feel like that's why it's our time. I think God has made it like that - because we make positive music, we make high vibrational music.""


Meanwhile in the UK, British artists have been developing their own style and sound, such as Afroswing, which merges Afrobeats with dancehall, grime, rap and R&B.


Grammy award winning producer Jae5, based in the UK, has produced mega-hits for Burna Boy and Dave.


""The main influence that I'm infusing things with is the African culture,"" he told BBC News.


""I'll make a hip hop song and it will still have a lot of percussive elements. I might make a ballad and I'll have more percussive elements than a normal track. So the African sound is what is continuous in my music. The groove of Africa is very different to the groove over here.""


Having swept the globe and landed at Glastonbury, what's next for Afrobeats?


Jae5 can see it going from strength to strength, as people are ""infatuated"" by the sound.


""The world is huge and Afrobeats has so much space to grow,"" he said. ""And the fact that [fans] are receiving it in the way they are is amazing.""

"KJ Spio, Sarkodie, Loick & Ambre drop Jealous","Four incredibly talented individuals across the music industry from different corners of the world have joined forces for a brand-new collaborative Afro/R&B single ‘Jealous’.


‘Jealous’ brings together UK singer, Loick and Roc Nation US singer, Ambré for a female empowerment single. The two sonically complement each other throughout the track with their beautiful vocals, whilst African Rap giant Sarkodie takes a verse about his leading lady.


Loick leads the way with his voice floating above the simmering keys delivering beautiful melodies with Ambré taking over effortlessly, singing in her sweet, compelling voice. Their vocals then blend over each other in a unique way, intertwining so smoothly.





KJ Spio says “it’s about treating someone so well and making someone so happy that others are jealous of the relationship.”


The track delves into appreciation of women and treating them right which is shown in the visuals.




ABOUT KJ SPIO


Acclaimed culturepreneur KJ Spio is a one-man mood enhancer – a musical multi-hyphenate devoted to upping the ambiance of whatever social situation you might find yourself in. 


“I’m all about creating a vibe that helps people have fun and enjoy themselves, whether they’re at a party or somewhere more intimate,” smiles the Ghana-born artist.


For Spio, the term ""culturepreneur” reflects the ever-changing role he’s held down in the UK and African music industries for almost a decade now, pushing the culture forward in whatever new and exciting ways he can dream up. Sometimes, that has meant managing artists like late great British talent Cadet, whose single ‘Advice’ he helped become a platinum smash independently with over 250m streams. 




Other times, that has meant creative-directing and A&R for superstars like Ghanian icon Sarkodie, whose first ever virtual concert, performing at the country’s historic Independence Square, broke records for live streams. Genre doesn’t matter – only authenticity. 


“If it’s not progressive to the collective culture, I don’t do it,” insists the hitmaker, who began his journey in the music industry as road manager-turned-content creator for UK rap hero Big Narstie and hasn’t stopped hustling for the music scene he adores since.

Hajia 4Reall sentenced to over a year in U.S. prison for romance scam,"Ghanaian influencer Mona Faiz Montrage aka Hajia 4reall has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for her role in a series of romance scams and laundering the proceeds from those schemes.


The sentencing occurred in New York under U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken.


Montrage, known for her social media presence, was arrested in the United Kingdom on November 10, 2022, and extradited to the United States on May 12, 2023.


The charges against her included conspiracy to receive stolen money, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.


Montrage pled guilty to these charges on February 21, 2024, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave.




Timeline of Legal Proceedings



November 10, 2022: Arrested in the United Kingdom.


May 12, 2023: Extradited to the United States.


February 21, 2024: Pled guilty to conspiracy to receive stolen money.


June 3, 2024: Initial sentencing date, postponed to June 28.


June 28, 2024: Sentenced to one year and one day in prison.



The Scam


Montrage was involved in romance scams that targeted vulnerable senior citizens, promising them marriage and subsequently defrauding them of their money.


Over six years, 32 victims lost approximately $1.4 million. Montrage laundered the proceeds through multiple bank accounts she opened in her name.







Courtroom Details


During the sentencing, the Assistant U.S. Attorney highlighted the severity of Montrage’s actions and the impact on the victims.


“The victims were vulnerable senior citizens. Some were promised marriage; they sent and lost money,” said the prosecutor. Montrage’s defence argued for a lighter sentence, citing her abusive relationship with a former boyfriend who was also involved in the scams.


Montrage expressed remorse in court, stating, “I want to pay them back. I feel shame as a mother of an eight-year-old daughter. Please have mercy on me,” before breaking into sobs.




Sentence and Consequences


Judge Oetken sentenced Montrage to one year and one day in prison, allowing her the possibility of “good time” credit, which can reduce her sentence by a few days. Additionally, Montrage agreed to pay $2,164,758.41 in forfeiture and restitution.


In light of her sentence, Montrage’s defence requested that she be allowed to return to Ghana immediately after her release to avoid detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The prosecution consented to this request.

— Inner City Press (@innercitypress) June 28, 2024 


Wider Impact


The case has garnered significant attention in Ghana, with many following the proceedings closely. The U.S. Attorney’s Office emphasized the need for a sentence that would serve as a general deterrence, given the media coverage and Montrage's influence in Ghana.


Montrage’s case underscores the severe consequences of participating in romance scams and highlights the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to prosecute such crimes.


The influencer’s sentencing aims to send a strong message about the importance of integrity and the legal repercussions of fraud.

Vernacular rap will limit you  Hammer to rappers,"Ghanaian music producer Edward Nana Poku Osei, also known as Hammer, has said that it is difficult for African rappers who use their local languages to break international boundaries.


Although Hammer says this doesn’t apply to songs, he believes the reach of rap on the global stage is dependent on the language used.


He said this in an interview with Kwame Dadzie on Joy FM’s Showbiz A-Z.


“It’s easy to sell vernacular in a singing format than in rap because 'sing-songs' have melody. Rap songs are words. So the beats drive rap songs. Listen to Zibote, we still don’t know what they were talking about but we love it because it is a song-song. 


It is easier for a 'sing-song' to cross over, like Asake with the Yoruba. He can cross over with it because it is a 'sing-song' but if you rap in Yoruba you will go hungry,"" he said.




Explaining further, Hammer explained why Sarkodie now does more English rap than he used to do in the past.


“Sarkodie has suffered out there. The reason he has transformed into an English rapper, is that he has to move on because the vernacular rap will limit you,"" he stated.


He said he was impressed with Sarkodie’s English rap delivery on his ‘No Pressure’ album.  


Recently, Sarkodie dazzled rap music fans with his impeccable flow on the Hennessy Africa Cypher 2024. 




The eight-minute cypher also features other lyrically-gifted rappers on the African continent: Maglera Doe Boy (South Africa), Didi B (Ivory Coast), Young Lunya (Tanzania), Khaligraph Jones (Kenya), and Ladipoe (Nigeria).


This comes a few weeks after he released 'Brag', a hiphop song that generated a lot of excitement in the rap fraternity. 


Hammer, after taking a break from active music, announced his return last year. In the meantime, he is preparing to release an album titled 'Upper Echelon'.

Empowerment Worship Centre kicks off Stand in the Gap 2024 Conference,"Empowerment Worship Centre (EWC) has started its highly anticipated prayer conference, Stand in the Gap (SITG), from Thursday, June 27th to Saturday, June 29th, 2024.


The event will take place at the Prayer Factory in Dzorwulu, Accra.


""Stand in the Gap"" is a 48-hour prayer marathon designed to ignite a deeper connection with God and shape destinies.


Under the theme ""Answered Prayer,"" the conference aims to empower participants through fervent prayer and the revelation of God's will.


EWC has assembled a team of renowned spiritual leaders to guide the prayers, including Rev. Dr Robert Ampiah Kwofie, Apostle Ben Doku, Pastor Matthew Thompson, Apostle Paula Michelle White Cain, and Pastor John Hannah.




“Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood, but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire,” said Prophet Gideon Danso, Host Pastor of EWC.


“It is our responsibility to pray,"" said Pastor Matthew Thompson. ""In receiving answers from God, there is a tension between the will of God and the way of God.”


Apostle Ben Doku emphasised the power of intercession, stating, ""One of the most powerful forms of prayer is intercession because Jesus 'ever lives to make intercession for the saints!'""


Pastor Joe Mettle highlighted the importance of worship and posture in prayer: ""Our (outward) posture in worship matters, but the most important posture is the posture of our heart!”




Other notable speakers at SITG include Pastor Akesse Brempong, Pastor Nathaniel Bassey, Pastor Victoria Arenze, Uncle Ato Minister Sunmisola Agbebi, Ebuka Songs, and EWC Live.


“We pray, we tarry, and intercede for our nation, our loved ones and family and friends for 48 hours! If you are a prayer addict, then this is for you, said Prophet Danso.


The conference is expected to be a transformational experience, featuring an outpouring of the Spirit and a deep connection with God. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in fervent prayer, receive prophetic guidance, and experience the transformative power of worship.


Prophet Danso encourages all attendees to prepare their hearts for an impactful experience: ""As we lift our hands, rend our hearts, and raise our voices during SITG, there will be answered prayers and open doors!""

According toThe Guardian, the 43-year-old urged the House committee to do more to protect children placed in youth care facilities, including foster care programs.


Hilton recounted horrific abuse that she experienced, sharing that she was ""force-fed medications and sexually abused by staff"" and ""violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked and thrown into solitary confinement"" as a teenager.


Hilton was forced to live in various boarding schools when she was a teenager after her parents expressed concern regarding her ""rebellious behaviour."" 


One of the institutions she was involuntarily forced to endure was the Provo Canyon School in Utah. She previously spoke about the abuse she faced at the school in her biographical documentary This Is Paris.




During the congressional hearing, Hilton said that her experience in these institutions was ""isolating and traumatic."" She also explained that she couldn't inform her parents of the abuse, because her phone calls were being monitored by staff.


""It’s really difficult to tell anyone in the outside world. A lot of these kids are not believed because these places tell the parents they’re being lied to and manipulated because they want to go home,” she explained. ""These programs promised healing, growth and support, but instead, did not allow me to speak, move freely or even look out a window for two years.""


Hilton suggested her parents, and many others, were ""completely deceived"" by the school. She specifically called out private equity firms who have a large stake in the industry and said they place profit over the safety of children.


""This $23 billion industry sees this population (of vulnerable children) as dollar signs and operates without meaningful oversight,"" she said, per Reuters. ""There's no education in these places, there's mold and blood on the walls. It's horrifying what these places are like. They're worse than some dog kennels.""




She hopes her testimony will convince Congress to reinstitute Title IV-B, a federal fund designed to help child welfare programs. She also wants them to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act.

Alcohol isnt the only problem; Ill take on media stations promoting gambling  Kofi Kapito,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Consumer Protection Agency, Kofi Kapito, has expressed serious concerns about media stations promoting gambling, by advertising betting brands on their channels.


He said he will take on all platforms that authorise the advertising of such acts.


Kofi Kapito’s agitation coincides with the Food and Drugs Authority’s directive to prohibit celebrities from endorsing alcoholic beverages, a decision which was upheld by the Supreme Court this week after a suit was filed to challenge it.


Speaking on Joy Prime’s Prime Morning, he noted that alcohol consumption or abuse is not the only vice in society; highlighting smoking and gambling.


“There are some things that are considered vices in life: alcohol is one, smoking is another, even womanising and gambling. I have a big issue, and I’m going to take that out with all the media stations now promoting gambling, the betting. These are vices,” he reiterated.







Mr Kapito does not condemn adults above the age of eighteen who indulge in such activities, but he advises that the future of young people must be secured, which is why laws are enacted to protect the vulnerable in society.


He also reiterated that all media platforms have been cautioned against promoting specific behaviours, but they fail to comply with the rules since the laws are not enforced.


Citing the deviant conduct observed in traditional media, he wonders if Ghana has efficient and vibrant media regulatory bodies to check and ensure culprits are dealt with.


“When you self-regulate, the law doesn’t come after you. The media houses have been warned about not doing certain things, and they don’t adhere because the law is not there. They don’t even want to self-regulate. I’ve engaged GIBA on several occasions. Sometimes I even wonder if the National Media Commission works because Sarpong will tell you that he doesn’t have what it takes to fight.”




Likewise, Mr Kapito remarked that some programmes are repeatedly shown on television stations during inappropriate hours, and the NMC ignored them.


He revealed that he is the instigator of the FDA’s directive against well-known persons endorsing alcoholic adverts and that he is pleased with the results of his efforts.


He blamed parents for keeping silent about such promotions on TV, despite the harm it may cause to their offspring. He urged media houses to tread cautiously.


He said he is hundred per cent (100%) in support of the FDA’s decision and the court’s ruling on the case, adding that the Authority is not completely ripping the individual celebrities from earning an income but is requesting collaborative work to ensure sanity in the industry.

Joy FM listeners talk about how men deal with heartbreak,"Dealing with heartbreak is a universally challenging experience, yet men often navigate this emotional terrain differently due to societal expectations and cultural norms.


Men may face unique pressures to suppress their emotions, exhibit stoicism, and quickly move on from the pain.


This can lead to diverse coping mechanisms ranging from seeking distraction through activities or new relationships to withdrawing and processing the hurt in solitude.


On Friday’s edition of Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, the phone lines were opened for men to share their stories.


While many confirmed that their heartbreak devastated them, others were of the view that their heart was not broken at all.

WADEMOS launches Democreatives in Nigeria,"The West Africa Democracy Solidarity Network in collaboration with Ghana Centre for Democratic Development, Africtivistes, Awo Hub, and Yiaga Africa, has launched ‘Democreatives.’


‘Democreatives’, an initiative aimed at leveraging the power, influence and resources of creatives in the West Africa sub-region to promote and defend democracy, was launched in Lagos, Nigeria on Friday, June 21, 2024.


The programme had in attendance creatives from various countries in the sub-region who shared ideas on how they can amplify activism towards democratic consciousness. 


There was also a panel discussion with creatives such as playwright and poet, Chief Moomen (Ghana); rapper MI Abaga (Nigeria), rapper Sister LB (Senegal); artist and journalist Ben Osar Youssouf Barry (Senegal) and Yemi Adamolekun (CSO leader in Nigeria). It was moderated by Cynthia Mbamalu from Yiaga Africa. 





The discussion was based on spotting the opportunities and challenges in advancing the cause of democratic awareness. 




Nigerian disc jockey, DJ Switch, who was very instrumental in the #EndSars movement, highlighted the influence of creatives in creating democratic consciousness, in her keynote address. Ghana’s Grammy-nominated artiste Rocky Dawuni, also sent in his message, admonishing players in the culture and creative industries to be proactive in taking part in democratic activities that will ensure to the benefits of the citizens. 





In his address, Dr. Kojo Pumpuni Asante, the Director of Advocacy and Policy Engagement at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) stressed the need to use creatives to advance the cause of democracy. 


He also spoke to Joy FM on the sidelines of the launch about prospects of the initiative.


“All across Africa, there are huge governance challenges. Young people in their millions are feeling despondent. They feel that even democracy is not working. It’s not delivering the dividends that will improve their welfare. So  some people say ‘why don’t we get military governments?’ 




I think everybody believes that every true society that will be developed and sustained needs to have right to expression and freedom. So there is not alternative to democracy. But what we have to do is recognise the problem and confront it. One of the best ways to do this is use every necessary resource we have in society, and an area we have neglected is the use of our creatives. 


If the people have so much influence in terms of their music, their art, how can they also raise their voice to address some of these challenges and move people so that we can begin to overcome the challenges,” he told Joy FM. 





Asked what activities and initiatives have been tabled in their roadmap for this agenda, Dr. Asante said more interactions with the creatives will spawn subsequent actions.


“We see this launch as a conversation starter, a movement. We have created a platform for creatives and other activists to come together to see how best to work together,” he said.




These, he believes, could be achieved through a series of targeted workshops, collaborative campaigns, public forums and concerts.


The launch of Democreatives sought to provide creatives with the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and engage with democratic processes, to create collaborative platforms for artistic expression focused on governance and civic issues, and inspire and facilitate active citizenship and political accountability by the creative community.


It was also aimed at deepening our understanding of the context, role, and opportunities for creatives in West Africa and to leverage the abilities, skills and talents of creatives for democratic consolidation and the promotion of democratic norms and values in West Africa.


Paul Osei Kuffour, Network Coordinator of WADEMOS, did a presentation on the dwindling fortunes of democracy in West Africa and why creatives must get involved.




There was a presentation of a set of artistic drawings based on discussions at the event, a performances by Awo Hub, Killa Ace (Gambia) and Sister LB (Senegal).


Background 


In recent years, the global landscape of democracy and governance has faced numerous challenges. From the erosion of civil liberties to the rise of authoritarianism, the need for an informed and active citizenry has never been greater. 


The West African, Central African, and Sahel regions have witnessed nine coups since 2020. The coup in Niger is the latest challenge thrown at the sub-region, bringing to four the number of countries in francophone West Africa undergoing political transition. These series of setbacks have reversed the gains made at consolidating democracy and good governance and have highlighted the challenges to stability and cooperation within the regional organization. 




A September 2022 Afrobarometer poll indicated a decline in support for democratic elections in 26 of the 30 African countries surveyed between 2011 and 2021. This trend extends to nations with historically stable electoral processes, such as Ghana and Nigeria.


Creatives play a crucial role in reflecting societal values, inspiring change and proposing alternative solutions by using arts to express their opinions, perspectives, and experiences on socio-political issues, such as democracy, human rights, corruption, development and culture. Through arts, creatives can raise awareness, challenge stereotypes, and inspire societal change. Again, creative arts create spaces for participation, interaction, and collaboration among different stakeholders in society- artists, activists, policymakers, politicians and citizens.


Creatives have, through their skills, talents and products, tackled the exercise, maintenance, and dynamics of power through a variety of artistic means. This political and civic consciousness that influences their artworks increasingly defines African art as citizens seeking the dividends of democracy and demanding improved democratic governance and good leadership.


West African youth, most notably young women and creatives, have been at the forefront of several protests and movements against democratic backsliding and bad governance, pushing against violations of democratic norms and values. In recent years and over the past months, several notable mobilizations, including the EndSARS protests in Nigeria – which saw the involvement of many creatives, the Y’en a Marre and Balai Citoyen movements in Senegal and Togo.




In 2020, Yiaga Africa and the African Movement for Democracy created an album titled ""Music as a Messenger of Democracy"" that uses music to encourage young people to get involved in politics. 


This pan-African project features musicians from Senegal, Mali, The Gambia, Togo, Nigeria, and Benin and addresses issues including corruption, peace, and good governance.


Despite the potential and efforts of creative arts and the creative industry, it has not effectively positioned itself to address the perennial democracy and governance challenges across West Africa and the sub-region and there has been a lack of collaboration between creatives and other democracy champions. 


The disconnect between creatives and everyday governance issues limits the promotion of citizen mobilization and accountable governance.

UG authorities have no issues with Shatta Wale  Dean,"The Dean of Students Affairs at the University of Ghana, Professor Rosina Kyeremanten, has responded to allegations regarding the cancellation of Shatta Wale's performance at the Reunion Rave Artistes Night organised by the TF Hostel.


In an interview with Radio Univers, she told Campus Express that the organisers of the programme did not follow the right procedure while submitting their proposal for the event.


""It is not true there was approval for the artiste night (Reunion Rave) for TF. Normally, what happens is that if any event is going to be organized in any hall a request for approval is sent to my Office (Dean's Office) with an outline of the program they intend to organise. What they said they were going to do on Saturday was Karaoke Night and so we gave approval. As far as I am concerned there is a big difference between a Karaoke Night and Artiste Night,"" she noted.


According to the Dean, the authorities needed prior notice of the nature of the event to help in providing adequate security.


""The University has no issues with Shatta Wale. The University doesn't have anything to do with Shatta Wale. Limann Hall sent a letter requesting approval for their programs including Artist Night and I forwarded it to PRO VC because of the ban on public gatherings and the final approval comes from him. I didn't even know who was on the bill to perform until I later saw their flyers and it was Stonebwoy so I called the President (of the Hall) to assure me of the security. Their letter had to go to the Legon Police District Command and I also asked them to get extra security,"" Professor Rosina said. 




She further noted that ""when you are having an artiste night, it comes with a lot of implications: Security and others. So we need to ensure there is enough security and that is why you need approval from the University Authority. Mind you there is still a ban on students gathering so you cannot just get up and bring an artiste like Shatta Wale without the adequate and necessary arrangements being made.""


Statement from the organisers


Wave Africa, the organisers of the Reunion Rave Artistes Night issued a statement to explain why Shatta Wale did not perform at the Reunion Rave Artiste Night slated for Saturday, June 8, 2024.


The programme organised in collaboration with TF Hostels, generated conversations on socials media after news broke that Shatta Wale was prevented from performing even though he had been billed for show.




According to a press release issued by the agency, they were contacted two months ago by the executives of Jean Topp Nelson Yankah Hall to provide an artiste and organise the event on their behalf.


""The 2 months-long deliberations were concluded and a formal contract was signed on Wednesday, 5th June, 2024,"" they write.


The statement further indicates that following the contract signing, the Wave Africa team proactively secured and signed a deal with Shatta Wale to perform on the night, and his promotional poster was subsequently released.


However, on Friday, 7th June, 2024, they saw an online communique from the Dean of Students' Office announcing the cancellation of the event.




""We contacted the hall executives, who were responsible for securing the venue as per the contract. They assured us that the issues with the Dean of Students office had been resolved.


Based on the assurances from the hall executives, our team proceeded with the event plans. Additional security measures were arranged with law enforcement agencies to ensure an incident free event,"" their press statement further indicates.


They explained that on Saturday, 8th June 2024, during their setup and sound check, the ""Legon campus security interrupted, saying it's an 'order from above'.""


They said a delegation from their team met with the Dean of Students and was informed that the event could proceed but without Shatta Wale's performance, so they adhered.

All set for Miss Musilimah 2024,"The organisers of Miss Musilimah Ghana (MMG), Cruz House Event, have announced preparations towards the third season of the pageant, after a year-long break.


This year’s competition of all-Muslim pageant which runs from now to October is dubbed 'The Vote Free Season.’


The pageant would require no voting throughout the competition, making MMG the first beauty pageant in Ghana to introduce no voting.


Speaking to the media about the new development, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ms Hawa Alidu, explained the rationale behind the decision as a way to make the competition even more accessible to people from diverse economic backgrounds.


“Most times, people who do qualify to some of these pageants do not end up auditioning because they first of all think about who and where they would be getting their voting support from. The few who make it through auditions are not typically evicted halfway into the competition due to insufficient votes, regardless of how good they may be. We want our contestants to feel that they have equal opportunities as far as voting is concerned,” she said.




Beyond this bold decision, organisers are also considering raising the cash prize amount for potential winners as well as introducing other amazing corporate and entrepreneurial opportunities for participants.


Another addition to this year’s edition is the introduction of the ‘Humanitarian Project Pitch’, a community-based project aimed at addressing a basic humanitarian need.


According to Mss Hawa Alidu, “this aims at preparing our contestants to become global citizens and to be aware of the responsibilities they have as individuals to maintaining a globally safe environment.”


She further hinted that they are open to sponsorships, partnerships, and support from corporate organisations, institutions, brands, government agencies as well as individuals who would like to be part of the MMG community.




Over the years, MMG has created an enabling platform for young Muslim ladies to excel and become their best selves in a non-Muslim-dominated industry while breaking stereotypes and changing the status quo for Muslim women through beauty, intelligence and modesty.


Audition for this year’s season is also free and is currently open. Interested young Muslim ladies are expected to send a short video of themselves in their modest Hijab or Turban, and introduce themselves, their aspirations, inspirations as well as their motivations for joining Miss Muslimah Ghana to the organisers.

Wave Africa, has therefore, apologised to the event patrons for not being able to deliver Shatta Wale's performance as promised. 


""We have referred the matter to our legal team and are making efforts to reach out to all stakeholders involved,"" they wrote in their press statement.

Hundreds thrilled at Atarah Praise 2024,"It was an atmosphere of praise and worship as hundreds turned up at this year’s Atarah Praise held at the forecourt of Believers Grace Crown Ministries International at Adenta Barrier. 


Atarah Praise which was held on May 19, 2024 with the theme, “Praising God for his acts of power Psalm 150:1” is an annual event aimed at winning souls for the Kingdom of God.


Prior to the main performances, an opportunity was given to some amazing young ministers to be a blessing to the gathering. This saw Mag Narh, Anointed Michael, Nana Kwartemaa, Richard and West African Senior High Choir mesmerise the patrons.


They enjoyed unforgettable ministrations from gospel heavyweights such as Patience Nyarko, Lady Prempeh, Akesse Brempong, Jack Alolomi, Mabel Okyere, Piesie Esther and Empress Gifty.


They took patrons through some of their amazing compositions and rocked them with some unstoppable praises.




The time everyone was waiting for came, when the man of the moment, Prophet Atarah took his turn on the big stage.


Clad in Blue and Yellow Military-like apparel, Prophet Atarah proved why he is the singing prophet.


He mesmerised the gathering with an intriguing display on the stage, and sang songs from his repertoire as well as performed his ‘Woye Odo’ together with Piesie Esther.


At the end, Prophet Atarah won new souls for Christ and expressed his appreciation to everyone for their diverse support in making the programme a success.

The Legend of Aku Sika play faces copyright infringement allegation,"The National Theatre of Ghana has been notified about a possible copyright infringement regarding an upcoming play to be staged at the premises.


In a letter dated May 28, 2024, sighted by myjoyonline.com, George Apraku Dentu asserts that ‘The Legend of Aku Sika’, a play to be staged at the National Theatre on 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th June, 2024 is the brainchild of his father L.D. Apraku. 


“This is a dramatization of the novel Aku Sika written by the late L.D. Apraku,” the letter states.


He further indicates that the producers of the play ImageBureau and April Communication, did not seek permission from him.


“…there has not been any contact of the performing group with the copyright owners of the novel ‘Aku Sika’,” he writes.




Speaking to myjoyonline.com, Dentu said there was a possibility that ‘The Legend of Aku Sika’, written by Professor Martin Owusu, was inspired by his father’s book. 


“I read online that the play which is about to be staged at the National Theatre is based on Nana Kwame Ampadu’s ‘Aku Sika’, and the song is based on the novel ‘Aku Sika’ written by my father,” he said.


Asked if he had read Professor Martin Owusu’s version to ascertain if it bears any similarities with his father’s, he said “no, I haven’t read it. That is why I said ‘possible infringement’.”


Meanwhile, the Team Lead for Image Bureau, George Quaye has explained that Professor Martin Owusu took the story from a folktale, which means that George Apraku Dentu’s father is not the original owner of the story. 




‘The Legend of Aku Sika’ will be performed at the National Theatre on 1st, 2nd, 8th and 9th June, 2024 in honour of the author Professor Martin Owusu, a lecturer at the University of Ghana who has imparted generations of actors and theatre art professionals.


It stars actors such as Mawuli Semevor, Edinam Atatsi, Arnold Asamoah Baidoo, Roland Adom, Elvis Crystal, Adomaa, among others.

"Champagne, caffeine and chaos: Fashion week descends on Paris","If you want to enter an alternate reality for six days, Paris Fashion Week is the place to do it.


When I board my Eurostar from St Pancras on a rainy Tuesday, I'm not sure what to expect from Menswear Spring/Summer 25.


The usual cohort of bleary-eyed commuters from London is this time interspersed with sunglass clad models and frazzled looking PR professionals, desperately trying to keep on top of their emails.


Model Emily Ratajkowski made an appearance at the Loewe show (Alexandra Mavros)


Paris is a changing city - despite being notorized for its art and romance, it has evolved over the decades into a savvy business hub, but one area it will always maintain its devotion to is being one of the greatest fashion scenes on the planet.


And Parisians take their commitment to the cause very seriously, as one stylist told me while surrounded by at least 15 Russian models: ""It's a fashion week afterparty, of course we have to go in wearing sunglasses.""




Louis Vuitton: Pharrell Williams takes over Unesco

Twice a year, designer brands from all backgrounds descend on the city and historic buildings are temporarily co-opted; all for the love of fashion.


One such building is the Unesco building, home to the unveiling of Louis Vuitton's new collection under the creative direction of Pharrell Williams.


As one of the most acclaimed luxury brands in the world, the anticipation at the show matches its surroundings.


Murmerings about star appearance echo the streets, as fans queue down the block, pressing against barriers and standing on tree trunks to catch a glimpse of the show's VIPs.




Pharrell Williams was appointed Louis Vuitton's Men's Creative Director in 2023Reuters


The front row includes Anna Wintour, Sabrina Carpenter, Burna Boy, Stormzy, Loyle Carner, Tems and Michael Fassbender.


The show celebrates athletic prowess, with reworked football jerseys throughout the designs and nods to the upcoming Olympic Games.


At the finale, Williams comes out looking jubilant, mobbed by a crowd of Louis Vuitton crew members wearing denim jackets emblazoned with “The World is Yours”.


Prototypes: Kanye West's favourite brand


If Louis Vuitton is a sophisticated older brother, Prototypes is its' rebellious younger sister.




Much like Louis Vuitton, Prototypes pulls its inspiration from the sports and a devotion to football which borders on religious.


The key difference here is that this younger sibling clearly spends her weekends deep in the Berlin clubbing scene. Prototypes is a brand that speaks to the alternative fashion movement.

Since its launch in 2021, it has collected star studded fans such as Playboi Carti and Noah Cyrus. As I sit waiting for the show to start, I ask a journalist why the show is running an hour late?"" She turns and says: ""You didn't hear? Because Kanye's coming.""


The controversial rapper has championed the brand since its inception. His public appearances with his wife, Bianca Censori, have caused a stir over the past few years and it has now been revealed that these looks have been the work of Prototypes designers.




This is no exception when the pair arrive at the Paris show: West's face was completely hidden in an outfit resembling a beekeeper, whilst Censori modeling a sheer nude bodysuit replete with pink hair.

Quiet luxury at Issey Miyake and System


By contrast, the shows at both Issey Miyake and System are dreamy and soothing.


System, a Korean brand known for its clean lines and modest layers, set stage at a construction site with high ceilings and mist machines.


The theme of Issey Miyake is 'Up, Up, and Away!' and the open air runway is ethereal, colourful and sophisticated.




The sophistication is what people expect, as I overhear on the way to the show: ""There won't be celebrities at Issey. It's a very elegant brand.""

Designs make pointed references to political discontent and social unrest. In a turn of events that is so ironic that it feels choreographed, despite being asked to arrive at 7pm, guests line the streets waiting to enter for almost an hour.


Being fashion week, many have chosen their outfits based on fashion over function and resultantly, are now standing around on the street in oversized jackets, head-dresses and impractically high heels.




As it's also mid-June, the sweat is kicking in and people are getting restless.

Tensions rise as a series of immaculately-clad punters show up, walk straight past the agitated queue and insist they are VIPs and should be let straight in. They are overheard saying: ""Surely I don't need to queue... right?"" as they confidently skip the crowds.


In true Parisian form, they are told the same thing as everyone else and sent straight to the back of the line, which now wraps around the block, past everyone they overtook.


The cherry on top of this deliciously entertaining cake happens when the ""l’éboueurs"" (bin-men) arrive and the smell of refuse that has been standing in the heat all day wafts through the queue.




When guests are finally let in, the show makes up for the blip tenfold, offering guests a multi-sensory experience, packed with glamour, activism, an impeccable soundtrack and politically charged cakes.

The second ever runway show from 032c magazine


Berlin-based culture magazine 032c invites guests to experience fashion week through the eyes of its co-founder Maria Koch. Koch transports the audience to an underground, glam-rock New York club in the nineties, under flashing lights and heavy bass lines.


Models with slicked back hair, sunglasses and heavy eye makeup donned leather, structured lines and sequins - crossing the lines between Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, David Bowie, and Neo from the Matrix.


The star studded runway line-up includes: Stella Maxwell, Yasmin Wijnaldum, Alex Consani and Gabbriette Bechtel, who recently announced her engagement to the 1975's Matty Healy at a Charli XCX chow.

Dries Van Noten's last ever show


The crown jewel of this season's fashion week is, no doubt, Dries Van Noten's final show. The designer's first show took place in 1991 and after 33 years of gradually becoming everyone's favourite, he announced this Menswear week would be his last.


Much of the chatter during the final days centred around how grand the final show would be, who would be in attendance, and whether there would be a dry eye in the house by the end.

As expected, the Belgian designer does not disappoint. I arrive at the venue on the outskirts of Paris, where usually quiet industrial streets are now filled with blacked-out taxis and supercars.


We move towards the vast warehouse that stands before us and I am reminded of a funeral procession. The atmosphere is palpable, as another journalist tells me: ""It's Dries Van Noten's final show. Are you ready to cry?""


As I enter the venue, I'm mesmerised by the sheer scale of it. In the centre of the room, which has ceilings that easily stand at three storeys tall, from floor to ceiling stands a huge cube.


Upon it, huge images of various runway shows over the years are projected. I am transfixed by his use of colour, movement and the joy on the faces of the models.

This is a clear legacy show and the guest list at the cocktail dinner is living proof. As I overhear when I walk in: ""Oh my god. That's Diane Von Furstenburg. In the same room as Martin Margiela and Venus Williams. I think my head is about to explode.""


I walk through and scan the crowd around me and soon enough, my head too feels about ready to explode.


After Dries' generously warms up his guests on champagne, entrees and industry chatter, the lights dim and one of the huge curtains surrounding the back opened.


Voices of the thousands of attendees reduced to a hush and the room moved like a magnet towards the opening.


As I step through the entrance what stands before me blows my mind. The runway is like nothing I have ever seen: it is at least half a mile long and stands proudly, covered in aluminium taffetta.


The sheer distance of it obscures faces into pinpricks and the warehouse that houses it could easily house enough livestock to feed a small country.

As the show starts, a booming voiceover transports the audience to Van Noten's imagination.


The monologue muses about time, age, love and change.


The models Van Noten has selected mark the passage of time, some have been with the label since its early shows in the 1990s, such as Alain Goussin.


The designer is usually known to have models come down the runway playfully, sometimes even running or on bicycles. This time, they walk calmly and reflectively.

The looks include effervescent coats and suits, large distressed bags and gender-neutral shorts.


Some designs have a distinctly Japanese style, using a technique called ""suminagishi"", which layers ink onto water which is absorbed by the fabric and dates back 1,000 years.


Using this technique, Van Noten seamlessly combines shapes of flowers and fire - akin to the Japanese word for fireworks ""hanabi"".


The collection plays with soft, pastel tones and the occasional pop of Metallics - perhaps to symbolise Van Noten's transition into his golden years.

In a final press release, Van Noten comments: ""This is my 219th show; like the previous ones it looks ahead. Tonight is many things, but it is not a grand finale.""


Van Noten writes: ""I think about how Marcelo Mastroianni once spoke of a paradoxical “Nostalgia del futuro,” beyond the lost paradises imagined by Proust, and how we continue to pursue our dreams knowing that, at some point, we can look back on them with love.""


In their wake, models kick up the runway's foil, sending remnants swirling into the atmosphere, like the legacy left behind by Van Noten's career.

On the grand finale, David Bowie's ""Sound and Vision"" plays out and I'm left stuck on the lyric: “Nothing to read. Nothing to say”, which seems to remark on Van Noten’s certainty that this is the right time to step away.


Ever humble, the designer keeps his goodbye on the runway brief, before revealing his last surprise for his guests: an enormous 1300kg two-storey rotating disco ball has been hidden behind curtains inside the centre of the cocktail room. Guests are invited to stay for the afterparty, as Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" accompanies bubbling champagne bottles being popped.


Much like Dries Van Noten's last hurrah, Paris Fashion Week ends on a high and leaves us wanting more.

West Africa Music and Arts Festival officially launched in Accra,"The West Africa Music and Arts Festival (WAMAFEST) has officially launched in Accra, Ghana, drawing together leading music industry professionals and stakeholders from across West Africa.


The festival promises to be an exhilarating celebration of the region's rich cultural heritage and its global influence, culminating in a grand concert at the University of Ghana on Saturday, June 22.


Hosting WAMAFEST for the first time, Ghana adds this vibrant event to its growing list of international arts festivals, including the Chale Wote Street Art Festival, AfroFuture, and the Black Star Line Festival.


In his opening remarks, the CEO of the Ghana Tourism Authority, Akwasi Agyeman, emphasized the importance of collaboration among West African countries to preserve and promote their cultural heritage through music.





 He stated, ""Music knows no borders, and neither should our efforts to protect our heritage.""




Prof Jasmine Young, Director of the Warner Music Blavatnik Center for Music Business at Howard University, underscored the significance of sustaining the festival for future generations.


""WAMAFEST is not just about today; it’s an investment in our cultural future,"" she said.


Adding to the excitement of the festival, a Juneteenth Parade will take place over the weekend, celebrating freedom and promoting tourism and economic development in the subregion. 


The West Africa Music and Arts Festival is part of the ""Beyond the Return"" campaign, a 10-year successor to the ""Year of Return"" campaign in 2019, which marked the 400th anniversary of the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Virginia, USA.







The launch event attracted notable attendees, including Ghana’s Minister for Tourism, Arts, and Culture, Andrew Agyapa Mercer; Second Lady, Samira Bawumia; CEO of the Ghana Tourism Authority, Akwasi Agyeman; and representatives from various West African countries.


Also in attendance were officials from Global A&R Warner Recorded Music, MUSIGA President Bessa Simons, HipHopPreneur and Marketing Strategist Professor Jasmine Young, alongside numerous music executives and artists such as Efya, Reggie Rockstone, and Trigmatic.


With the stage already set, WAMAFEST promises to be a blend of cultural pride and unity, resonating far beyond West Africa.

"Even at 95, legendary James Barnor wants to live longer and inspire more","""I never met him but I know he was very strict, I am also told that I have some similar traits to him,"" a curious young man retorted after just coming out of a room full of volunteers helping out at a workshop in Jamestown, Accra.


Papa Kofi Darko was referring to his grandfather who he never met in his lifetime.


But he still holds close to his heart the old photographs and stories handed down to him about the disciplinarian Presbyterian priest he was and some apparently similar attributes they share to which he jokingly says “I don’t know how true that is.”


Papa sorting through his photos at 'Vanishing Past: A community archiving workshop' in Accra


“I am just grateful that I am still able to experience him and hear stories about him after all these years,” the bespectacled Kofi told me at a digital archiving workshop in Accra where dozens of others had gathered as well.


Photographs are not just the freezing of time, they hold memories that evoke emotions words cannot. I guess that’s why they say a picture is worth a thousand words.




Si Hene was nearing the end of day 3 of its workshop, the Vanishing Past and I was conversing with its Founder, Rita Mawuena, an artiste whose works usually reflect Ghanaian royalty and cultural influence.


In May last year, Rita had Accra stunned with her ‘In the World not of the World’ exhibition which centred around majestic quintessence in the local traditional setting.





But today wasn’t about colourful umbrellas nor traditional ‘Ahenfie’ regalia, this time it was about the ordinary person.


The memories that had been tucked away in decaying copies of photographic paper which conveyed images of essential value to people.




Negatives that had been transformed into the black and white images that underpinned the shaping of generational stories that were told to visitors in each home via a photo album that sat at the centre table of almost any vintage Ghanaian home.


The 3-day community archiving workshop was to help digitise old images and documents as a way of enhancing their durability and restoring the promise that these stories behind them will be told without compromising the original form in which their essence was captured.


So patrons that walked into the Jamestown Café weren’t looking for much, but the simple motive to preserve that one dear family image to remind them of how that past felt like.


It has been a rainy couple of weeks in Accra but that did not deter residents from coming out.




Rita did not take this for granted. 


Founder of Si Hene, Rita Mawuena


In the open compound outside under the gathering clouds for what may have been another episode of the day’s light intermittent showers, the Si Hene founder lamented that “literally, our history is vanishing, just because photos are getting destroyed, we are not really seeing the importance of photography within our identity as well…”


This is why she decided to put up the event – to digitise, old photographs, documents, or stories.


However, she did not expect the level of submissiveness that was demonstrated by the audience and the vulnerability shown by the residents.




“And even for people to say that ‘okay I have all my family photos, I have hundreds, here you go’, just being able to feel that wow, you’re literally in someone’s house within their photo album or an envelope,” she said.





“We have to also kind of think of our families as museums, you’re not going to let anyone and everyone listen to those stories and see these photos because some of these photos are very important to you. You might cherish them or they might actually show memories that you maybe haven’t actually talked about before, and I think you really have to trust that person that you are actually having that conversation with. I think for that, it has shown me that this is something that is needed.”


Two octogenarian friends were a prime examples of this experience when they walked in that Sunday.


Before I get into their interesting encounter, the event was also geared towards celebrating legendary Ghanaian photographer, James Barnor and the celebration of his 95th birthday.




Back to my two uncles. Between the well-positioned ornamental plants in the café’s garden were sat these two old friend from Jamestown.


Having come by from church, 70-year-old, Joshua Annor flipped through the pages of one of the books written about Frederick Seton James Barnor.


Some images from the 50s and 60s tickled their fancy. Occasionally, Mr Annor – an avid fan of Barnor’s work - would show his friend images and they would both point to areas in present-day Ghana, recounting how much the aesthetics of Ghana’s landmarks have changed.


70-year-old, Joshua Annor flipped through the pages of one of the books written about James Barnor


After every few turn of pages, he would just say to his friend “James Barnor has done really well,” and then return to moisturize his thumb with a quick flick over the tip of his tongue.




He told me that many of the images were nostalgic and was glad that Mr Barnor documented these special moments.


In his coffee newsboy hat, Mr Annor was just getting to how appreciative he was about the works when he spotted another of James’ photos that took him aback – The Accra Race Course.


That photo was taken during Ghana’s Independence Day celebration in 1957.

“Those good old days… then life was free and didn’t care about anything. We were kids though, but we were able to follow big brothers to places to watch a whole lot,” he said while approaching the exit.




The previous day, I encountered an Associate Curator for Photography for the Musee National d’Art Moderne/ Centre Pompidou in France, Damarice Amao.


She led a team to put together a retrospective book of works titled ‘James Barnor, The Road Maker.’


Associate Curator for Photography for the Musee National d’Art Moderne/ Centre Pompidou in France, Damarice Amao.


The book compiled photos from James’ career and flaunted his work as a true colourist.


Reflecting on her work around the man, Damarcie was ecstatic about the attention given to James Barnor as he celebrated this milestone on his home turf.


Back on the compound, Rita Mawuena has been explaining the Barnor factor in this specific archiving workshop.


Explaining how this ties into James’ legacy she said “The thing about James’ archives is that he has so many photos of everyday life of Ghana. So now how do we also now go into these family archives and really see what our families were within the past like within the 1950s, ‘60s and 70s.”





As our chat progressed I could hear prompts in the background from some Si Hini protocol team members.


After listening through the external but pulsatingly loud whispers while Rita spoke, I remember telling her during the filming: “I think James Barnor is here.”


Without flinching, the Si Hene founder sprang out of her seat and made her way towards the main scanning area.


And there he was, the man of the moment, who is being celebrated for his stellar work, now live in colour – which he is credited for introducing in the 1970s...lol.


For nearly 70 years, James’ work has created the timeline for Ghana’s transition in a very eclectic way – a true reflection of a body standing the test of time.


From documenting Accra’s changing landscape to photographing icons who have etched their names in the annals of the country’s history, he has seen it all.


James Barnor in 1952


At a young age, Frederick Seton James Barnor was charged to teach pupils how to weave baskets.


It was during one of those sessions that the headmaster of the basic school where he plied that trade gave him a plastic Kodak Brownie camera to play around with.


As a committed 17-year-old at the time from a family of photographers, the rest was history.


After a botched move to become a police officer and a subsequent apprenticeship with his cousin, J.P Dodoo, James set up his own studio called FS James Barnor’s Quick Photo Services.


Everything the photojournalist, portraitist, and lifestyle photographer has touched since then has turned gold.


Some works of James Barnor


As the first staff photographer employed at Daily Graphic, he has made impressions far and wide including South Africa’s first black lifestyle magazine, Drum leaving Accra draped with his works at exhibitions for to commemorate his 95th.


Globally, he has left his mark in every way you can think of as he continued his work in London as a freelancer doing marvelous work in top publications, and fashion images among others.


His images show the fast pace of the multicultural changes in London – where he has lived since 1994 after traversing Accra and the British capital for about 35 years prior.

Today, he is a national asset who most photographers worldwide look up to for inspiration as one of the very few of his kind ever to live.


This is why his appearance at the Jamestown Café brought the place to a standstill.


It was surreal. He was back in the town where it all started - clothed in his smock and surrounded by his people united in celebration of the mission he set out to accomplish.





I looked as he sat, seemingly enthused and looking up at his vintage works that had been interpolated in the artwork for the day’s event.


One could almost hear his thoughts loudly trying to restrict the amazing reaction as he sat still in his calm and unassuming demeanor – and of course, reciprocating pleasantries with the excited attendees.


With all the international accolades in a bag, what else does fulfillment mean to this man?


From Mohammed Ali to Dr Kwame Nkrumah – name all your greats, and chances are they may have been touched by the powerful lens of James Barnor at some point.


Could it be the acceptance by the people of the heritage and the tradition that gave him a shot?


One of James Barnor's favorite pictures, 'Baby on All Fours', c. 1952


This thought had been lingering for some time now, which is why I decided to ask the nonagenarian;


Even though you’ve been celebrated globally, how does it feel to be celebrated by your own people back home?


He described it as exceptional!


“I have a message for Ghana which may not be as meaningful outside. It should be here. I am happy that I am given the audience, the voice to celebrate it here and be heard.”


And the message was clear, and if the series of activities lined up by creatives to celebrate him was anything to go by, the messengers are now in multitudes.

For much of his earlier years, Mr Barnor’s work did not get the acclaim it enjoys now until he was about 78 years old.


That was when his portraits stunned many during a Ghana @ 50 jubilee exhibition at the Black Cultural Archives. From there, the only way has been up.


The photos had aged like fine wine and he would go on to do many including his first major solo retrospective of his catalogue in 2010.


It was hosted at Rivington Place in London and called ‘Ever Young: James Barnor’ – named after his first studio back in Accra ‘Ever Young’ - and received wide coverage by the English press.


For James, the urge to make an impact is his drive. The will to leave a seed of commitment and hope to foster development in the next generation of freethinking African photographers is at the core of Barnor’s delivery – and he still holds that principle dear.


At the archiving workshop, another female photographer and volunteer could not help but make it known to James how much his legacy has fueled her passion for photography.


Struck by this development, Mr Barnor said “These things make me happy.”

""Otherwise I will say 90 is enough, 95 is too much so I better go. But when I meet people who are inspired by me I want to stay longer and inspire more people.""


With lots of energy, he walked the gathering through each story that made his already exceptional stories even more unique.


He did this with enthusiastic readiness as if he was 25 all over again.


At 95, James Barnor stands as a towering figure in Ghana’s history.

Just as his work has depicted the transitions in societies, the legendary creative genius has seen the changing phases of life.


Even at this age, Frederick Seton James Barnor sees life in the mundane and keeps capturing hearts and we continue to see the world through his eyes.

Global South Arts and Health Week 2024 held in Accra,"The Global Arts in Medicine Fellowship, Arts in Medicine Ghana, the Global South Arts and Health Envoy, in collaboration with Te-Apo Foundation, have organised the Global South Arts and Health Week (GSAHW) Ghana Pavilion 2024 to promote holistic health through art, education, and community engagement.


The festival, themed “Health Beyond Medicine”, was held from 20th to 26th May 2024 in Accra and witnessed over 500 participants patronising the entire program throughout the week.


The week-long festival addressed vital thematic areas such as Mental Health, Neuroscience, Brain and Geriatric Health, Public Health, Child Health, Inclusive and Safe Society, Good Health and Well-being, Health Promotion and Education, Climate Change and Environmental Health, Disability, Maternal Health and Maternal Mental Health.


Mr. Christopher Bailey, the Arts and Health Lead of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Co-founder of Jameel Arts and Health Lab, in his keynote address, said, “One of the things about stroke that is important and all non-communicable diseases is that it gets to the heart of health.”





“In our 1947 WHO constitution, health is not merely the absence of diseases and infirmity but the attainment of the highest level of physical, mental and emotional wellbeing. Thus, it is more than just the absence of a disease but rather about being the best human that you can be,” he added.




Miss. Doris Komla, the Country Festival Director of the Global South Arts and Health Week (GSAHW) mentioned that working and collaborating with different people from diverse fields to champion this worthy cause has been a great privilege.


“The journey to establishing such a great initiative was birthed out of the frustration linked with the statistics available. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death among Ghanaians and it is ranked as number one for women and number five for men. Another layer to these statistics is that most people who fall victim to stroke cannot afford to pay for CT scans; hence, for every second that they do not get a CT scan, brain cells are dying,’’ she explained.


Miss. Komla further revealed that there are people in other regions of Ghana who cannot access the nearest hospital to get a CT scan for stroke. Adding, “These major issues need to be addressed as a community and we got the chance to tackle them during the Global South Arts and Health Week Ghana Pavilion 2024 in Accra.”





As part of the creative response to the intersection of the arts and health, a body of work created by Dr. Kwasi Aboryo Ankrah, a medical doctor and artist through his sculptures and paintings advocated for stroke management and the support for stroke patients in Ghana during the festival.




It is of notable mention that Te-Apo, an organisation run by Dr. Ankrah, has been at the forefront of stroke advocacy in Ghana. The support of the organisation towards the GSAHW Pavilion 2024 was profound.


Miss. Komla expressed profound gratitude to the organising team, valuable volunteers, participants, sponsors, and collaborators who contributed to the success of the Global South Arts and Health Week (GSAHW) Ghana Pavilion 2024.


The organising team include Dr. Kwasi Aboryo Ankrah (Arts and Programme Engagements Coordinator), Dr. Abdul Karim Hakib (Theatre and SDG Coordinator), Dr. Sharon Attipoe-Dorcoo (Strategy and Content Generator), Miss. Naa-Amy Wayne, MPH (Resource Person for Gender Advocacy), and Mr. Nana Yaw B. Manaphraim (Regional Liaison Director).


Others are Saidatu Abdallah Zablong (Global Arts in Medicine Alumni Cordinator), Mr. Emmanuel Amah, Mr. Prince Obodai, Mrs. Vivian Amponsah, Mr. Selasi Sena Nyatuame, Miss. Dorencia Goka, Mrs. Sarpomaa Bempong and the Te–Apo Foundation.







Dr. Nana Aba Kwenua Pobee, the Associate Country Festival Director of GSAHW during the closing ceremony highlighted the significant contributions and discussions on critical topics such as autism, climate change, female and sexual reproductive health.


“The festival's diverse and engaging lineup offered unique opportunities for education, dialogue, and reflection on various health-related issues. Attendees participated in interactive workshops, support circles, art therapy sessions, and health screenings, gaining valuable insights and experiences.”


Worth acknowledging were the theatre performances by the students from the School of Performing Arts of the University of Ghana, Legon, led by Dr. Abdul Karim Hakib. These performances sparked conversations that, without a doubt, continued after the festival.


Dr. Pobee added, “The arts have always been a part of health. They are an ever-present voice. The GSAHW Ghana Pavilion 2024 only raised this voice by decibels. Now, in Ghana, the arts and health will be heard. The arts and health will be listened to. Every community will be called in.”

“The theme reflects on our ancestors' struggles and triumphs, drawing strength from their resilience as we strive to build stronger, more cohesive communities. slavery and emancipation are real-lifeevents in our history. 


They are also symbols of the remarkable capacity of the human spirit to struggle and triumph over adversity. We have always known ourselves to be people who have turned our hearts against injustice, inhumanity, and deception. We have stood up and demanded fairness and equality for all, regardless of their race, color, creed, gender, or class here in Ghana and across the world,” he added.


He encouraged Africans worldwide to acknowledge the importance of Emancipation Day, celebrated on August 1, 2024 to pay tribute to pioneers of the struggle for freedom from bondage.




“I wish to state that those of us Africans at home and abroad must be encouraged to see the wisdom of the internationalization of Emancipation Day. Its acknowledgment is essential. We all must come together on August 1st each year to praise our great ancestors who featured prominently in the emancipation process,” he said.


The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA), Akwasi Agyemang, announced plans to redevelop tourist sites, including the Salaga slave market, to commemorate the courage, community, and culture of African ancestors and the diaspora.


“We are looking at the redevelopment at the various tourist site for the emancipation day. Currently we have work ongoing at salaga the slave market and many more. We are basing this on the 4cs . One is to celebrate the courage of our ancestors who fought relentlessly, we also want to celebrate the community of African diaspora, culture of Africans,” he noted.


The celebrations will take place from July 22 to August 1, 2024, under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture.

"I am married but I am single, the other side of spousal migration","Nothing excites a couple more than to move beyond the fine ‘I love you’ rhetoric to saying “I do” to each other in the full glare of witnesses. It is a never-to-be-forgotten memory when you walk down the aisle hand-in-hand, hearts knitted together and saying I do to the man or woman you love and cherish. It comes with it a new sense of fulfilment, a deeper joy of new beginnings, notwithstanding the higher call for commitment and responsibility.


Such was the feeling of the authors- Emmanuel and Gina Idan who nurtured a relationship right from High School into marriage. They took their vows with passion and swapped smiles, hugs and kisses with verve. The excitement was at a crescendo, not entirely oblivious of the challenges that come with the institution whose certificate they had received even before they attempted to dot the I’s and cross the ts. Yeah, that is marriage.


When his wife Gina swore to submit (Ephesians 5: 22-24) in response to his promise to love (Ephesians 5: 25), all in the full glare of the witnesses, they both were convinced and ready to carry out their vows as husband and wife, dwelling together (1 Peter 3:7).


But seven months later everything changed. The vows were at risk of being abandoned; their lives had become a little boringly stale, a stark contrast to scenes at the wedding.


Unlike biblical Joseph who presided over seven years of plenty and seven years of lean season, the authors shared seven months of bliss immediately after the wedding, and awful lot of years of misery staying married but living single.




It is these years of misery put together in a revealing riveting story of “I am married but I am single.”


A great storytelling with simple, easy-to-relate narration, the authors from Chapter One, get the reader spellbound, treating a delicate issue of spousal migration in a way none other has.





The story behind my new three-piece suit


I encountered Vid when I was 16 years old. She was my mum’s closest neighbour. We lived in the same compound house together. I ran errands for Vid and assisted her with domestic chores. Because she lived alone, I was the caretaker of her single-room apartment whenever she travelled. Vid was beautiful, peaceful, and kind, and I benefited immensely from her kindness as an errand boy.




One day, she invited me to her room. ‘I have a special gift for you’, she said, but this time not in her usual bubbly self. She pulled a suit bag from her wardrobe and handed it to me. I opened it in her presence. It was a beautiful new grey three-piece suit. I was excited. I smiled awkwardly and thanked her profusely. When my mother returned from work that night, I told her the good news. As usual, I showed her my new suit and asked her to thank Vid on 


my behalf. At this point, my mum recounted the story behind that beautiful suit, my newly acquired property.


When Vid’s husband first left for the UK, their communication was frequent and filled with love. Alex would write Vid heartfelt letters, send her thoughtful gifts, and provide financial support. However, two years later, the once vibrant communication became sporadic. The silence was deafening, and Vid couldn’t ignore the growing distance. Alex often blamed his demanding work schedule for the lack of communication, but little did Vid know Alex had started a new life with another woman.


After 5 years of Alex’s domicile abroad, Vid received a perplexing letter from him. The content of the letter was shocking and heartbreaking. The content of the ‘divorce letter’ is paraphrased below:




I apologise for disappointing you, but I cannot continue the marriage. To secure my stay in the UK and avoid deportation, I am married to a new lady. If you will not mind, should any man come your way, you can marry him. I will compensate you for the time wasted and the inconvenience caused. I am sorry!


Several months after the devastating revelation, Vid decided to part with Alex’s wardrobe. The three-piece suit she had given me was Alex’s meant for their wedding, a dream now shattered. I became an unintended beneficiary of Vid’s broken marriage. Vid’s,” that was an excerpt in Chapter One.


Was the gift of the three-piece suit a premonition of what would happen in the author’s life? What forced one of the newly wedded couple out of the country? What were the challenges, the experiences and the coping mechanisms living apart as a married couple? How did they manage the natural urge for sex when they did not share a bed for many years? What happened to the marriage? What lessons are there to learn from this?


All the answers to these and more you will find in; “I AM MARRIED BUT I AM SINGLE, THE OTHER SIDE OF SPOUSAL MIGRATION.“




A must read story for couples who want to stay married but still desire to travel abroad one at a time.

                            ‘Spousal migration can crush relationships’",Emmanuel and Gina Idan,Books | Relationships,27 May 2024 3:19am,https://www.myjoyonline.com/i-am-married-but-i-am-single-the-other-side-of-spousal-migration/
Spousal migration can crush relationships,"The chairman of the Christ Apostolic Church International, Apostle Samuel Amponsah Frimpong says spousal migration tends to crush marriages and plunge partners into temptations if they fail to deal with its challenges.


He indicated that spousal migration will for a long time become part of human existence as people continue to travel to places that are deemed greener and leave their spouses behind.


Apostle Frimpong Amponsah in a review on the subject of spousal migration in the book, ""I am Married but I am Single, the Other Side of Spousal Migration"", authored by Emmanuel Idan & Gina Idan said, the absence of one of the partners negates the objective for the existence of marriage Institution.


He also said apart from the difficulties spouses may face as a result of their absence to support each other, it could also have a toll on the lives of the dependants, especially children.


He said ""Spousal migration separates partners in marriage and negates the very reason for which the marriage institution was ordained by God. Spousal absence can seriously imperil relationships and plunge marriage partners into temptations”.







“The absence of the man or the woman opens doors and Satan can easily take advantage of it to wreck the marriage. The strength of the Godhead is in the ability to dwell together which shows how married couples must manifest the strength of this kind of unity,” he added.


He therefore appealed to married couples especially Christians to critically discuss such an important issue before any of the partners migrate, leaving one partner behind for various reasons.


A co-author of the book ""I am Married but I am Single, the Other Side of Spousal Migration"", Emmanuel Idan in an interview with Daily Guide said a major theme of the book which is yet to be launched is prolonged distant relationship with limited certainty of physical reunion and its social and psychological impact on left-behind spouses and children.


He added that the book discusses some of the challenges married couples face because of spousal absence drawn from their experience of staying apart for almost seven years barely eight months after their marriage where one partner had to travel abroad for economic reasons.




Other topics discussed in the book include marriage, spousal migration and Economic Empowerment,   diaspora life, and years of sex starvation.


The authors also espouse God's intended plan for marriage and marital relationships, at what point partners or would-be partners need to quit, what people should know before accepting proposals from would-be partners domiciled abroad.


Among some of the notable people who reviewed the 132-page book is Joyce Rosalind Aryee, the executive director of Salt and Light Ministries.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

How Afrobeats made it to the very top of Glastonbury,"On Sunday evening, Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy will fire up Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage.


While he has played at the UK's biggest festival before, this is his first time on the famous main stage, which has been Glastonbury's focal point for decades.


Fellow Afrobeats star Ayra Starr also performed on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, while Tems had a slot on the Other Stage.


From West Africa to the world stage, Afrobeats has risen rapidly to dominate playlists and radio.


On Spotify, the Afrobeats genre has grown by 1,200% since 2017.




But with its artists now performing at the very top of the UK's biggest festival, it feels like another threshold has been crossed.


""It's our time,"" Starr told BBC News. ""It’s been a long time coming and we deserve this.""


So what is Afrobeats all about, and how has it taken off?


West African origins




Ayra Starr took to Pyramid Stage on Saturday


The genre has its roots in Nigeria and Ghana, and started rising rapidly in popularity in the 2010s, with early hits from artists like Fuse ODG and D'banj.


It is not to be confused with ""Afrobeat"" - minus the ""s"". That is a movement created in the 1960s and 1970s by the artist and activist Fela Kuti.


Kuti's musical style is a fusion of traditional African rhythms with funk, jazz and highlife.


Coincidentally, Kuti himself played at Glastonbury in 1984, and this year, his son Femi Kuti played on the Pyramid Stage.




But Afrobeats, with an ""s"", is a completely different sound. It is generally seen as a fusion of traditional West African musical styles with Western pop, rap and dancehall.


""Afrobeat spoke to a much older audience,"" said DJ Edu, who hosts BBC 1Xtra's AfroSounds show.


""Afrobeats has been driven a lot by social media,"" he said, adding that young people, travelling to different parts of the world, also helped spread the sound.


Burna Boy, Tiwa Savage and Wizkid are among the genre's superstars


There were challenges, of course. DJ Edu said that a lot of people who started out making Afrobeats were not clued up about the music industry.




""They were just kids making music from their bedrooms, not worrying about streaming or royalties. That was the big problem, there was no structure,"" he said.


But as bigger artists started making headway, younger ones were able to learn from them and chart their own route in the industry, he added.


DJs in the UK started fusing pop music with Nigerian and Ghanaian beats, taking the sounds to new audiences.


Songs from the genre regularly started crossing into the mainstream, with its first big global success being the release of Oliver Twist by the artist D'banj in 2012.




The song made the top 10 on the official UK Singles Chart and was number two in the UK R&B Charts.


It is often described as the first time Afrobeats really took hold in the UK.


Rise in popularity


From then on, Afrobeats quickly spread around the world. It has often been described as one of Africa's biggest cultural exports.


""We've been waiting for the globalisation of Afrobeats, and it's happening now,"" Starr said, speaking ahead of her Glastonbury performance.




""But it’s not just what you're seeing today. It's years and generations of musicians and hard work that’s made it what it is now.""


TikTok and YouTube - where many people discover new music - have played a big part in taking Afrobeats to new audiences in the UK, the US and beyond.


One example is Nigerian artist CKay's Love Nwantiti, which went viral on the app and became the most Shazam-ed song in the world in 2021.


Songs by singers Davido, Burna Boy and Wizkid have also gained popularity through their TikTok dance routines.




Collaborations with the likes of Beyoncé, Drake and Justin Bieber have also helped lift the Afrobeats scene to new heights.


For example, Drake featured Wizkid on 2016's One Dance - which helped put a spotlight on the singer and the genre he represents.


In the summer of 2023, Burna Boy made history when he became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK in front of a sold-out crowd of 60,000 at the London Stadium.


Tems played on The Other Stage at Glastonbury this year


""The genre's rise has been nothing short of meteoric,"" Sheniece Charway, YouTube's artists' relations manager for black music and culture, told BBC News.


""Afrobeats has ignited a global revolution, and it's captivating trajectory shows no sign of slowing.""


""Popular music is pop music and Afrobeats has become popular music globally,"" she added.


""We are seeing the likes of Wizkid, Libianca and Burna Boy all having global success, which shows that their audience is everywhere.""


In a sign of the genre's huge global popularity, it has been included as a category in a number of major awards.


Billboard in the US recently added an Afrobeats category, with Burna Boy and fellow Nigerian star Rema both recognised at the event in November.


Burna Boy, who has also been the recipient of a Grammy, dedicated his award ""to Africa and every artist coming out of Africa now"".


Rema and Selena Gomez won the Best Afrobeats award for Calm Down at last year's MTV Video Music Awards


Meanwhile Rema won a gong for his near-ubiquitous song Calm Down, which has smashed multiple streaming and chart records.


The track, which featured Selena Gomez, became the first African artist-led track to hit a billion streams on Spotify.


Accepting the Billboard award for best Afrobeats song, Rema thanked his fans and called the prize ""a celebration of unity and the global domination of Afrobeats"".


The MTV VMAs, Grammys and American Music Awards have also recently added the category of best Afrobeats.


DJ Edu says this recognition has meant a lot to Afrobeats artists.


""[It] shows there's a light at the end of the tunnel for this music,"" he said.


People are 'infatuated'


For Starr, part of the reason for Afrobeats' huge growth is the fact the sound is overwhelmingly positive.


""Afrobeats is enjoyment. You have to enjoy yourself, you have to be at a club or at a party to make the music that people want to dance to. And we like to dance,"" she said.


""I feel like that's why it's our time. I think God has made it like that - because we make positive music, we make high vibrational music.""


Meanwhile in the UK, British artists have been developing their own style and sound, such as Afroswing, which merges Afrobeats with dancehall, grime, rap and R&B.


Grammy award winning producer Jae5, based in the UK, has produced mega-hits for Burna Boy and Dave.


""The main influence that I'm infusing things with is the African culture,"" he told BBC News.


""I'll make a hip hop song and it will still have a lot of percussive elements. I might make a ballad and I'll have more percussive elements than a normal track. So the African sound is what is continuous in my music. The groove of Africa is very different to the groove over here.""


Having swept the globe and landed at Glastonbury, what's next for Afrobeats?


Jae5 can see it going from strength to strength, as people are ""infatuated"" by the sound.


""The world is huge and Afrobeats has so much space to grow,"" he said. ""And the fact that [fans] are receiving it in the way they are is amazing.""

Vernacular rap will limit you  Hammer to rappers,"Ghanaian music producer Edward Nana Poku Osei, also known as Hammer, has said that it is difficult for African rappers who use their local languages to break international boundaries.

He said this in an interview with Kwame Dadzie on Joy FM’s Showbiz A-Z.


“It’s easy to sell vernacular in a singing format than in rap because 'sing-songs' have melody. Rap songs are words. So the beats drive rap songs. Listen to Zibote, we still don’t know what they were talking about but we love it because it is a song-song. 


It is easier for a 'sing-song' to cross over, like Asake with the Yoruba. He can cross over with it because it is a 'sing-song' but if you rap in Yoruba you will go hungry,"" he said.




Explaining further, Hammer explained why Sarkodie now does more English rap than he used to do in the past.


“Sarkodie has suffered out there. The reason he has transformed into an English rapper, is that he has to move on because the vernacular rap will limit you,"" he stated.


He said he was impressed with Sarkodie’s English rap delivery on his ‘No Pressure’ album.  


Recently, Sarkodie dazzled rap music fans with his impeccable flow on the Hennessy Africa Cypher 2024. 




The eight-minute cypher also features other lyrically-gifted rappers on the African continent: Maglera Doe Boy (South Africa), Didi B (Ivory Coast), Young Lunya (Tanzania), Khaligraph Jones (Kenya), and Ladipoe (Nigeria).


This comes a few weeks after he released 'Brag', a hiphop song that generated a lot of excitement in the rap fraternity. 


Hammer, after taking a break from active music, announced his return last year. In the meantime, he is preparing to release an album titled 'Upper Echelon'.

"KJ Spio, Sarkodie, Loick & Ambre drop Jealous","Four incredibly talented individuals across the music industry from different corners of the world have joined forces for a brand-new collaborative Afro/R&B single ‘Jealous’.


‘Jealous’ brings together UK singer, Loick and Roc Nation US singer, Ambré for a female empowerment single. The two sonically complement each other throughout the track with their beautiful vocals, whilst African Rap giant Sarkodie takes a verse about his leading lady.


Loick leads the way with his voice floating above the simmering keys delivering beautiful melodies with Ambré taking over effortlessly, singing in her sweet, compelling voice. Their vocals then blend over each other in a unique way, intertwining so smoothly.





KJ Spio says “it’s about treating someone so well and making someone so happy that others are jealous of the relationship.”


The track delves into appreciation of women and treating them right which is shown in the visuals.




ABOUT KJ SPIO


Acclaimed culturepreneur KJ Spio is a one-man mood enhancer – a musical multi-hyphenate devoted to upping the ambiance of whatever social situation you might find yourself in. 


“I’m all about creating a vibe that helps people have fun and enjoy themselves, whether they’re at a party or somewhere more intimate,” smiles the Ghana-born artist.


For Spio, the term ""culturepreneur” reflects the ever-changing role he’s held down in the UK and African music industries for almost a decade now, pushing the culture forward in whatever new and exciting ways he can dream up. Sometimes, that has meant managing artists like late great British talent Cadet, whose single ‘Advice’ he helped become a platinum smash independently with over 250m streams. 




Other times, that has meant creative-directing and A&R for superstars like Ghanian icon Sarkodie, whose first ever virtual concert, performing at the country’s historic Independence Square, broke records for live streams. Genre doesn’t matter – only authenticity. 


“If it’s not progressive to the collective culture, I don’t do it,” insists the hitmaker, who began his journey in the music industry as road manager-turned-content creator for UK rap hero Big Narstie and hasn’t stopped hustling for the music scene he adores since.

Hajia 4Reall sentenced to over a year in U.S. prison for romance scam,"Ghanaian influencer Mona Faiz Montrage aka Hajia 4reall has been sentenced to one year and one day in prison for her role in a series of romance scams and laundering the proceeds from those schemes.


The sentencing occurred in New York under U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken.


Montrage, known for her social media presence, was arrested in the United Kingdom on November 10, 2022, and extradited to the United States on May 12, 2023.


The charges against her included conspiracy to receive stolen money, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.


Montrage pled guilty to these charges on February 21, 2024, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave.




Timeline of Legal Proceedings



November 10, 2022: Arrested in the United Kingdom.


May 12, 2023: Extradited to the United States.


February 21, 2024: Pled guilty to conspiracy to receive stolen money.


June 3, 2024: Initial sentencing date, postponed to June 28.


June 28, 2024: Sentenced to one year and one day in prison.



The Scam


Montrage was involved in romance scams that targeted vulnerable senior citizens, promising them marriage and subsequently defrauding them of their money.


Over six years, 32 victims lost approximately $1.4 million. Montrage laundered the proceeds through multiple bank accounts she opened in her name.







Courtroom Details


During the sentencing, the Assistant U.S. Attorney highlighted the severity of Montrage’s actions and the impact on the victims.


“The victims were vulnerable senior citizens. Some were promised marriage; they sent and lost money,” said the prosecutor. Montrage’s defence argued for a lighter sentence, citing her abusive relationship with a former boyfriend who was also involved in the scams.


Montrage expressed remorse in court, stating, “I want to pay them back. I feel shame as a mother of an eight-year-old daughter. Please have mercy on me,” before breaking into sobs.




Sentence and Consequences


Judge Oetken sentenced Montrage to one year and one day in prison, allowing her the possibility of “good time” credit, which can reduce her sentence by a few days. Additionally, Montrage agreed to pay $2,164,758.41 in forfeiture and restitution.


In light of her sentence, Montrage’s defence requested that she be allowed to return to Ghana immediately after her release to avoid detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The prosecution consented to this request.

— Inner City Press (@innercitypress) June 28, 2024 


Wider Impact


The case has garnered significant attention in Ghana, with many following the proceedings closely. The U.S. Attorney’s Office emphasized the need for a sentence that would serve as a general deterrence, given the media coverage and Montrage's influence in Ghana.


Montrage’s case underscores the severe consequences of participating in romance scams and highlights the ongoing efforts by law enforcement to prosecute such crimes.


The influencer’s sentencing aims to send a strong message about the importance of integrity and the legal repercussions of fraud.

Johnnie Walker Ghana celebrates Ghanaian global bartender champion Survaiva Donkor,"Johnnie Walker Ghana is thrilled to congratulate Survaiva Benjamin Donkor, a Senior Bartender at Tribeca Restaurant in Accra, on his victory in the Black Label Global Bartender Challenge for the Africa Region.


Survaiva's exemplary skill and creativity earned him the title of champion, and he will represent his country in Scotland, the birthplace of Johnnie Walker, during the Burns Night weekend in January 2025


Survaiva Benjamin Donkor’s winning creation, “The Black Secret,” is an exquisite blend of Johnnie Walker Black Label with fresh lemon juice, activated charcoal syrup, crème de cassis, coconut liqueur, and fresh pineapple juice. This cocktail not only showcases his remarkable mixology skills, but also embodies his ingenuity and tenacity in crafting.


The Black Label Global Bartender Challenge aims to showcase the outstanding qualities of Johnnie Walker Black Label while honouring bartenders who passionately support this award-winning Scotch Whisky. Survaiva’s triumph in the Africa region underscores his dedication and Ghana’s vibrant cocktail culture.


Marketing Manager for Spirits and Ready to Drink (RTDs) at Guinness Ghana, Yaa Amoah, emphasised the significance of Survaiva’s achievement, stating, ""Winning the challenge for the Africa region is truly a cause for celebration. The Johnnie Walker Black Label Bartender Challenge provides a platform for bartenders to showcase their craft through signature cocktails. Survaiva, the sole African among the global winners, exemplifies the spirit of 'Keep Walking' and has embarked on a life-changing journey.""









 Head of Reserves and Key Accounts at Guinness Ghana, Emmanuel Adu-Poku, highlighted the significant role that bartenders and waiting staff play as ""silent ambassadors"" of their establishments during the event.







He noted that in recognition of their role, Guinness Ghana has committed to training and empowering them, establishing platforms to elevate their visibility on the international stage.


“While Diageo Bar Academy sought to unlock beyond building the capability of bar tenders and waiting staff, it also presents them with the opportunity to make them market ready for whichever market they find themselves in”.







Johnnie Walker Black Label, a meticulously crafted Scotch Whisky with a rich heritage dating back over a century, remains a standard-bearer in the world of Scotch. Its blend of the finest whiskies from Scotland’s Four Corners, each bringing its own unique aromas and flavours, has made it a global favorite with its iconic, rich taste.




Johnnie Walker Black Label Global Bartender Challenge calls mixologists worldwide


Bartenders worldwide are invited to showcase their creativity by sharing an Instagram reel featuring their unique Johnnie Walker Black Label cocktail, along with an explanation of why this iconic blended Scotch whisky enhances their creation.

Participants will also enjoy a range of activities at Johnnie Walker Princes Street, the brand's flagship location in Edinburgh.









This Year’s Entrants


Judged by Tim Philips-Johansson, Johnnie Walker Global Brand Ambassador, and Jan Šebek, winner of the Johnnie Walker challenge at Diageo World Class 2023, entries underwent rigorous evaluation during a tasting session in Amsterdam. The judges sought cocktails that showcased Johnnie Walker Black Label in innovative and balanced ways.


Global Participation

Survaiva, a Senior Bartender at Tribeca Restaurant and newly appointed Diageo Bar Academy Trainer, impressed judges with his outstanding mixology prowess.

Sharon said her sister introduced her to Nwoke, and despite initial reservations, they connected deeply.


She said, “My love story is one that I’ll say is short of a miracle. I had just recovered from what I considered the worst heartbreak of my life, and I was filming, and my sister had said to me a friend of hers wanted to speak to me and I was like I wasn’t in the mood.

“I didn’t want to talk to anybody. Anyway, she gives this person my number and he is really smart. I was like, who is this person, and we probably didn’t speak as much as we should.


“Months passed he kept on trying to reach me, and I was like, this guy is really persistent. We kept on having really cute conversations, and one day, there was just one conversation that struck me. We spoke for about three hours. I was like I think I like this guy.

“I travelled and realised that he hadn’t called me in like two days, I asked 'why didn’t you call me?' And he said 'you told me you were going to go out and have fun'. I was like yeah, I’m single and he said 'I didn’t I want you to be single no more'.""




“We dated for literally two-and-a-half months, and I was engaged in the third month. And we married two months after there.”

Court grants Mohbads family permission to conduct a second autopsy,"Justice is still being sought ten months after the late singer Ilerioluwa Aloba, known as Mohbad, died. Mohbad, 27, died on 12 September 2023 under controversial circumstances.


Almost a year after his death, there appear to be conflicting reports over the cause of his death.


However, a recent development seems to have brought hope to the family, and his fans are seeking answers.


A court has finally granted his family permission to conduct a second autopsy. This decision comes after the family expressed dissatisfaction with the initial autopsy results, which were deemed inconclusive.


After several clamours for justice to ascertain the cause of his death, his body was exhumed on 21 September 2023 for an autopsy by the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH).




The autopsy, which commenced in September 2023, released on 7 June, failed to determine the cause of death.


The inconclusiveness of the autopsy results was attributed to body decomposition and potential reactions to medications he received before his death.


The Aloba family rejected the results and, on 16 June, urged the Lagos State Government to confirm the autopsy’s authenticity because of the public’s doubts and conflicting reports.


Mohbad’s family appealed to the coroner’s inquest’s presiding magistrate to ensure that an independent toxicology report is submitted to the court before the final report is submitted to the authorities.




The coroner’s inquest, whose role is to determine the identity of the deceased, the time, cause, and manner of death, has so far revealed that the first autopsy provided no conclusive cause of death.


Gratitude


During a Wednesday hearing at a magistrate court in Ikorodu, Mohad’s family and their legal representatives were


granted permission for a second autopsy,


With PREMIUM TIMES in attendance, at a subsequent press conference, the family and their legal team confirmed they received the court’s authorisation to proceed with the additional autopsy.




The Aloba family has been vocal about their dissatisfaction with the initial findings of the autopsy and has demanded an independent post-mortem and toxicology test.


The first autopsy, conducted with the state government’s involvement, did not yield affirmative results.


They questioned the authenticity of the toxicology test, allegedly conducted in the United States, which the US lab later denied.


Now, the family has been granted permission to conduct a private independent autopsy.




At a press conference on Wednesday, Mohbad’s father, Joseph Aloba, expressed gratitude for the court’s decision to allow for a second autopsy.


“I appreciate the responses all along to the death of Mohbad. We appreciate the judiciary for this decision. There is a reason for the government to instruct that we exhume Mohbad for them to know the cause of his death.”


At the court hearing, the singer’s father expressed shock at seeing his daughter-in-law Wunmi and his estranged wife (Mohnad’s mum).


He said: “It was sad seeing the mother and the wife because we haven’t been communicating for some days; it was like a shock.”




Second autopsy concerns


Asked when the results of this second autopsy would be ready, Grace Shorinde, one of the Aloba family representatives, responded, “If we consider today’s coroner inquest, we are already time-bound”.


“Whatever we do, we must have the results before 7 August. After concluding the coroner’s inquest, the legal team approached Joseph Aloba, who emphasised the urgency of acting on the received information.


“Those who were advocating for the boy’s burial now understand that Mohbad cannot be buried until the cause of death is determined, which must happen between now and 7 August,” she affirmed.


Human rights intervention


At the press conference, Rotimi Adigun from the Centre for Human Rights and Social Justice stated that in most cases like this, his organisation has internal plans for addressing the matter and prefers not to announce their actions publicly.




“We know justice delayed is justice denied. We are unhappy with how the case is going, but here to unite and not relent,” he said.


“We have our plan and know what to do concerning the case. We have pledged our support and are willing to assist in the case. We are fully in the case but cannot disclose our plan.”


Legal view


David Wonuola of TMK Music Worldwide highlighted the significance of the court’s decision to allow the application to record witnesses.


Mr Wonuola, a lawyer, explained, “The autopsy report is one of the variables to assist the court, along with other factors. Thankfully, today, the court allowed the application to record witnesses. This was prompted by the applications brought forward today.




“The current state of the report influenced that application because, once the report is finalised and confirmed, the court will focus on the evidence and testimonies of the respondents and witnesses presented.


“At this time, recording witness statements to elicit facts is important. The court will base its proceedings on the evidence or witness statements before it, which will assist in the path of justice.”


Mohbad’s family and their legal team remain hopeful that the second autopsy and ongoing investigations will bring clarity to the circumstances surrounding his death.

DJ and producer Diplo accused of distributing revenge porn in new lawsuit,"DJ and producer Diplo has been sued for distributing revenge porn, marking the second accusation lobbed against him for the same offence in less than a year.


In the suit, filed in California on Thursday, an unidentified woman referred to as Jane Doe said she had an intimate relationship with Diplo from June 2016 to October 2023. She started chatting with Diplo, whose real name is Thomas Wesley Pentz, on Snapchat in April 2016 when she was 21 years old. 


That June, he invited Doe to his Manhattan hotel room and began an intimate relationship that continued for years. Last November, the complaint says that she discovered Diplo had been allegedly distributing images and videos of their sexual interactions without her consent.


Doe states that during their relationship, she made it clear to Diplo that she didn’t want him filming or distributing videos or images made without consent. 


In November, she asserts that another woman reached out explaining that she had explicit videos featuring Doe in them that Diplo had given to her over Snapchat in Oct. 2018. On Nov. 7, Doe reported Diplo to the New York Police Department and a warrant was issued for his arrest.




Requests for comment from Diplo’s representatives and attorney went unanswered.


This isn’t the first time that Diplo has been accused of disseminating revenge porn. In 2020, a woman named Shelly Auguste claimed that Diplo had sexually assaulted her and distributed revenge porn without her consent. 


Diplo responded with his own suit and claimed on Instagram that she was a “stalker” who engaged in a baseless smear campaign.


In August 2023, Auguste filed another report with the Los Angeles Police Department alleging that he distributed nude photographs of her. In November, the LAPD submitted the case to the Los Angeles attorney’s office, and it was taken under review.




“Tragically, this is not the first time the defendant has shamed and violated a woman by disseminating intimate images without her consent,” said Doe’s attorney Helene Weiss, partner at Marsh Law Firm, in a statement shared with Variety. 


“Diplo’s alleged illicit pattern of behaviour illustrates the harm he’s caused Jane Doe, and other young women just like her.  Our client deserves justice, and she’s hopeful that this litigation may serve as a catalyst in ending the defendant’s repeated victimization of women once and for all.”


“Revenge pornography is an abhorrent violation of privacy and trust, inflicting profound emotional trauma on victims like Jane Doe,” adds Micha Liberty of Liberty Law. “Diplo’s actions represent a severe abuse of power and a blatant disregard for human dignity. It is imperative that we, as a society, condemn such actions and hold perpetrators accountable. This lawsuit is a vital step towards justice, highlighting the necessity of protecting the rights of those who have been exploited. Jane Doe’s bravery in speaking out against this injustice is a powerful reminder of the need for systemic change to support and safeguard all survivors of such violations.”


“Rampant repeated sexual abuse by the rich and famous is deeply embedded into the entertainment industry, but we are witnessing a cultural shift where survivors and their stories refuse to remain silent in the name of tours and ticket sales,” says Margaret E. Mabie, partner at Marsh Law Firm. “Our brave client’s story is one of Diplo’s many worst-kept secrets, and the filing this case is her first step at forging a path to civil justice.”

Empowerment Worship Centre kicks off Stand in the Gap 2024 Conference,"Empowerment Worship Centre (EWC) has started its highly anticipated prayer conference, Stand in the Gap (SITG), from Thursday, June 27th to Saturday, June 29th, 2024.


The event will take place at the Prayer Factory in Dzorwulu, Accra.


""Stand in the Gap"" is a 48-hour prayer marathon designed to ignite a deeper connection with God and shape destinies.


Under the theme ""Answered Prayer,"" the conference aims to empower participants through fervent prayer and the revelation of God's will.


EWC has assembled a team of renowned spiritual leaders to guide the prayers, including Rev. Dr Robert Ampiah Kwofie, Apostle Ben Doku, Pastor Matthew Thompson, Apostle Paula Michelle White Cain, and Pastor John Hannah.




“Every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood, but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire,” said Prophet Gideon Danso, Host Pastor of EWC.


“It is our responsibility to pray,"" said Pastor Matthew Thompson. ""In receiving answers from God, there is a tension between the will of God and the way of God.”


Apostle Ben Doku emphasised the power of intercession, stating, ""One of the most powerful forms of prayer is intercession because Jesus 'ever lives to make intercession for the saints!'""


Pastor Joe Mettle highlighted the importance of worship and posture in prayer: ""Our (outward) posture in worship matters, but the most important posture is the posture of our heart!”




Other notable speakers at SITG include Pastor Akesse Brempong, Pastor Nathaniel Bassey, Pastor Victoria Arenze, Uncle Ato Minister Sunmisola Agbebi, Ebuka Songs, and EWC Live.


“We pray, we tarry, and intercede for our nation, our loved ones and family and friends for 48 hours! If you are a prayer addict, then this is for you, said Prophet Danso.


The conference is expected to be a transformational experience, featuring an outpouring of the Spirit and a deep connection with God. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in fervent prayer, receive prophetic guidance, and experience the transformative power of worship.


Prophet Danso encourages all attendees to prepare their hearts for an impactful experience: ""As we lift our hands, rend our hearts, and raise our voices during SITG, there will be answered prayers and open doors!""

Artwork now most valuable Harry Potter item ever sold,"An original watercolour illustration has become the most valuable Harry Potter item ever sold - fetching $1.9m (£1.5m) at auction in the US.


The artwork for the first edition of JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sold for more than three times the expected price.


It was first auctioned in 2001, before the book series was complete, for £85,750 (about $108,000 at current exchange rates).


""This is really the first visualization of Harry and the wizarding world,"" said Kalika Sands from Sotheby's auction house.


The artwork had been expected to sell for between $400,000 and $600,000, which Sotheby's said was the highest pre-sale estimate for a Harry Potter-related work.




It took nearly 10 minutes for the four-way bidding to finish on Wednesday. The identity of the buyer was not revealed.


Thomas Taylor was just 23 when he painted the iconic illustration in 1997


The artist behind the illustration, Thomas Taylor, was only 23 years old in 1997 when he created the iconic image of Harry Potter standing in front of the Hogwarts Express - the train that would lead the young bespectacled wizard into the magical world.


It was done using concentrated watercolours with black pencil outlines and took him two days to finish.


Mr Taylor, who grew up in Wales, was one of the first people to read the manuscript for the original Harry Potter book, which went on to sell millions of copies and spawned a lucrative franchise including movies and theme parks.




Ms Sands said the difference in auction price between 2001, when only four of the seven books in the series were published, and now reflected just how popular author Rowling's creation had become.


""In the intervening decades, it's been extraordinary to see just the conclusion of Harry's story, but also how the Harry Potter franchise has taken off, and in that time, new generations have come to appreciate Harry and his journey as well.""

"Paris Hilton testifies in Congress about being force-fed medications, other abuse she endured in child welfare System","On Wednesday, June 26, Paris Hilton spoke during a congressional hearing about the state of child welfare in the United States, where she testified about her own experiences of abuse when she was institutionalized.


According toThe Guardian, the 43-year-old urged the House committee to do more to protect children placed in youth care facilities, including foster care programs.


Hilton recounted horrific abuse that she experienced, sharing that she was ""force-fed medications and sexually abused by staff"" and ""violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked and thrown into solitary confinement"" as a teenager.


Hilton was forced to live in various boarding schools when she was a teenager after her parents expressed concern regarding her ""rebellious behaviour."" 


One of the institutions she was involuntarily forced to endure was the Provo Canyon School in Utah. She previously spoke about the abuse she faced at the school in her biographical documentary This Is Paris.




During the congressional hearing, Hilton said that her experience in these institutions was ""isolating and traumatic."" She also explained that she couldn't inform her parents of the abuse, because her phone calls were being monitored by staff.


""It’s really difficult to tell anyone in the outside world. A lot of these kids are not believed because these places tell the parents they’re being lied to and manipulated because they want to go home,” she explained. ""These programs promised healing, growth and support, but instead, did not allow me to speak, move freely or even look out a window for two years.""


Hilton suggested her parents, and many others, were ""completely deceived"" by the school. She specifically called out private equity firms who have a large stake in the industry and said they place profit over the safety of children.


""This $23 billion industry sees this population (of vulnerable children) as dollar signs and operates without meaningful oversight,"" she said, per Reuters. ""There's no education in these places, there's mold and blood on the walls. It's horrifying what these places are like. They're worse than some dog kennels.""




She hopes her testimony will convince Congress to reinstitute Title IV-B, a federal fund designed to help child welfare programs. She also wants them to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act.

Ohemaa Mercy recounts harrowing childbirth experience,"Gospel musician, Ohemaa Mercy has shared the deeply personal and challenging experience she endured during childbirth.


In an interview on Adom TV, she said it was a life-threatening situation after being in labour for three days.


Ohemaa Mercy went into labour on a Tuesday, and by Friday, her child had still not arrived, despite medical interventions.


She recounted how the complicated labour posed significant risks to both her and her baby and the medical team decided to perform an emergency caesarean section.


The surgery, though successful, was followed by a further complication. Just a week later, her surgical stitches were removed, causing her wound to open.




Due to this complication, Ohemaa Mercy said she was rushed to the theatre for another surgery to save her life.


While the doctors were battling to save her life, the gospel musician said she was thinking about the medical bills.


This, she stated put her through physical and emotional stress.


However, in what Ohemaa Mercy describes as a miraculous intervention, her mother’s friend, a nurse, stepped in with alternative treatment and also provided essential support during this critical period.




For six months, Ohemaa Mercy said she had to walk with caution, bending to prevent further strain on her wound.


Ohemaa Mercy said the challenging recovery process not only tested her strength but also her faith.


She indicated that being alive today is a testament to the goodness of God.

Why Usher doesnt eat on Wednesdays,"Usher’s wellness routine includes a weekly fast. The R&B icon, 45, dished on how he prepares physically and mentally for his jam-packed life in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.


Most days start with a “moment of reflection,” says the eight-time Grammy-winning artiste. He switches up exactly what that looks like, either reading a book to “stimulate my mind,” meditating or practising yoga. 


“It really does help to activate my organs and get my mind moving in the right direction,” said Usher.


Unlike a lot of people, his mornings don’t usually start with coffee. “It all depends on how I ended my night before. 


Sometimes a coffee martini is appropriate,” joked Usher, who will receive the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 BET Awards on Sunday, June 30.




He continued, “No, typically I wake up and drink celery juice. I’ve been doing this concoction of lemon, ginger, water and cayenne pepper. I drink it hot.”


When he eats breakfast, the musician often opts for eggs scrambled with cheese, but only after he’s moved his body.


“I don’t like to eat breakfast before I’ve worked out or done something physical: taking a walk, stretching or doing yoga, sitting in the sun and raising my body’s natural heat levels. Then I eat,” he explained.


The one day that is an exception to this schedule is Wednesdays when Usher doesn’t eat anything at all.




“I fast, not for religious purposes, but it’s something my grandmother practised,” he said. 


“I typically try to start around 11 p.m. the previous day, then go the entire day on Wednesday just drinking water.”


In preparation for his Super Bowl halftime performance (“That was one of the hardest 15 minutes that I’ll ever have in my life,” he told WSJ), he turned up the heat on his already regimented exercise and diet routine.


On top of daily workouts, Usher said he was strict about eating healthy foods. 




“I was remedying my body the night before and waking up the next day and eating a very regimented, low-carb diet,” he said.

Sarkodie slams record labels in Hennessy Africa Cypher,"Ghanaian rap giant Sarkodie is not just being hailed for his sterling flow on the Hennessy South Africa Cypher; his message on how some record labels are ripping African artistes off, has caught the fancy of music analysts. 


While he proves his rap dexterity on this cypher, delivering predominantly in English with tinges of some Twi lingo, he touches on the theme of braggadocio and his value in the music industry. He also mentions, in his rap, how record labels take advantage of musicians.


Sarkodie who has, spoken about turning down offers to sign to record labels, particularly Akon's Konvict Muzik, raps:


I did this thing myself, I never messed with majors


They gave me documents like a thousand pages




I want my freedom because most of my homies are locked in cages


It's been a decade, I'm rapping, I'm the rock of ages.


This reiterates Sarkodie's stance on completely signing one's works to record labels. Some musicians have expressed their opinion on this topic in recent times. While some think it is a form of relief to musicians who are suffering to hit the limelight due to financial constraint, other have posited that they would rather be independent and sign distribution deals so they don't get constricted. They believe signing a 360 deal with a record label is a form of slavery.


Sarkodie goes ahead to suggest the big record companies come to talented African acts under the pretext of elevating them, while they ""rob them in a broad day.""




I taught you how to do this thing the right way


They smile with you but robbing you in broad day


I'm only human, I'm only doing what the lord say


Now, this is crazy




The Ghanaian rapper also talks about how bureaucracy in the organogram of the labels make it difficult to directly deal with other artistes.


It's kinda strange how this music has changed from how it was


I need a verse from my bro, a couple calls


But now I need to speak to some dude cos he's the boss




Split the publishing before we hit the stores


I don't mind, I know what I think in course


I can't hate, cos it's working, I see results


African music was buzzing but couldn't cross




As soon as we signed the paper work, labels opened the doors


Finally, he likens the activities of these big international record labels to ""fraudsters"".


Now I see how y'all really move


Cos the same thing that fraud people do




Throw a couple dollars, cage you in a zoo


Sarkodie has appeared in the trends for his coruscating performance on the Maison Hennessy cypher released on Tuesday, June 25, 2024.


The eight-minute cypher also features other lyrically-gifted rappers on the African continent: Maglera Doe Boy (South Africa), Didi B (Ivory Coast), Young Lunya (Tanzania), Khaligraph Jones (Kenya), and Ladipoe (Nigeria).


While every rapper on the project brings out their best to the admiration of rap enthusiasts, Sarkodie has received plaudits from most Ghanaians for consistently standing out in the rap game with his uniqueness and suave.




Some have also hailed him for instigation a conversation that a lot of people dread to broach: the ills of the operations of record labels.

"Brave, inspiring, crazy  the joy of managing Fela Kuti","At least a million mourners turned up for the funeral of Nigerian musician, and voice of the downtrodden, Fela Kuti, his manager Rikki Stein remembers.


“The road was filled with people as far as the eye could see,” he says looking back to that August day in Lagos in 1997.


The King of Afrobeat, who was revered by the people but feared by those in charge, had died at 58, reportedly of complications from Aids.


But Stein believes that Fela, who had been repeatedly arrested for speaking out against successive military regimes, actually passed away because of a much deeper cause.


“Fela died of one beating too many. His body was covered in scars and his mind and spirit had to cope with 200 arrests. The system can only take so much,” Stein tells the BBC in an interview to mark the publication of his memoir – in part about his 15 years managing arguably Nigeria’s most influential musician.




Throughout his long career Fela defiantly criticised those in charge, notably a succession of military rulers, lampooning them in albums such as Coffin for Head of State.


His music had the power to grab people from the inside and help them start to imagine another world.


“I was gob-smacked,” Stein, now 81, says as he talks about first coming across Fela’s albums in the 1970s.


“The music spoke to me in a way I’d never encountered, exuding warmth, intimacy, excitement and a constant feeling of anticipation. Every word spoke directly to my inner being, vividly describing life under a totalitarian regime, but I saw clearly how the message could be applied to any country.”




It is perhaps unsurprising that managing someone with such charisma and vision was unpredictable and hectic.


When in Europe, Fela liked to have the heating cranked up high, Stein says


Their first encounter in a hotel room in London in 1982, when Stein was hoping to persuade Fela take part in a music festival, hinted at what was to come.


“As I entered a wave of intense heat hit me.


“It was winter and extremely cold. I was wearing a hat, a coat, a scarf and a sweater. Fela, I learned, always carried additional heaters when on tour to approximate a temperature that he was used to.




“Fela was sitting on a couch, dressed in just a pair of Speedos [swimming trunks]. We shook hands and he invited me to join him on the couch.


“I commented on the heat and began removing some layers of clothing, although I didn’t get down to my Speedos. Suddenly we both laughed, beginning a friendship that endured for the rest of his life.”





Later that year Stein travelled to Lagos to discuss becoming Fela’s co-manager. Very early on, he had a sense of how much influence he had in his home country.


Stein was stuck in passport control while those in charge, behind some smoked glass, were idly checking the documents.




“Suddenly there was a commotion in the baggage hall. It was Fela Kuti, climbing over the carousels and heading towards us, shouting ‘Rikki!’. When he reached me, he gave me a hug.


“’What are you doing, standing there?’


I indicated the smoked-glass window. He walked over and clicked his fingers above the glass. The passport appeared. ‘C’mon Rikki, let’s go’.


“Fela drove us off. He was a great driver but, man, he drove fast, much as he lived his life.”




Fela was a multi-instrumentalist who commanded the stage


Over subsequent years, despite the intensity, Stein never tired of experiencing Fela performing on stage at full throttle.


“Fela reigned supreme.


“He was everywhere at once; playing keyboards, soprano or alto sax, the occasional drum solo, a sinuous dance from one side of the stage to the other and then it was time to sing, the ever-present spliff held in his elegant fingers.


“For sheer mastery, panache, style and guts, nobody could or can beat this guy.”




His performances were not mere concerts they were events – none perhaps weirder than an infamous show in Belsize Park, north London, that involved a simulated death and a surprise resurrection.


In 1984 Fela was appearing on stage with his mystical guru, a Ghanaian man known as Professor Hindu.


On the morning of the London show, Stein got a call from the publicist who was at the venue.


“’The Professor is here, digging a grave just outside.’ I called Fela, asking him if he knew why. ‘He doesn’t ask me why I play saxophone and I don’t ask him why he digs graves.’




“That night the Professor appeared on stage in a short skirt, a bib and the lampshade. His assistant, Emmanuel, joined him and sat down on a chair.


“The prof began sharpening a huge meat cleaver on a stone, then grabbed Emmanuel and began hacking away at his throat. Blood flew in every direction. The club was in pandemonium. A limp Emmanuel was carried outside and placed in the grave.


“Come Sunday a large crowd gathered around the grave. Suddenly, the earth began to move and a hand appeared! I pulled Emmanuel out. His hands were warm.”


The size of the crowd who turned up to his funeral in Lagos was testament to Fela's wide appeal


That year was also when the authorities in Nigeria had obviously had too much of the musician’s outspokenness.


Fela and the band returned to Lagos for a break before embarking on a US tour. Stein had given him a large amount of cash to cover food and hotel bills.


On his arrival in the country, the security officials made out that Fela had failed to declare the money, which was required at the time.


He was detained and then appeared before a military tribunal which sentenced him to five years in prison.


Stein believes this was never about the money. The military saw him as a thorn in their side and wanted to silence him.


But it had the opposite effect. His arrest caused a worldwide furore, Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience and his music became more widely known with radio stations devoting whole days to his work.


A new album – Army Arrangement - had been recorded before Fela went to prison and Stein was hoping to release it.


Short of cash, he accepted a deal that the tracks would be remixed with reggae drum and bass to make it more commercially appealing.


“Someone smuggled a copy to Fela who, mortified, said that hearing it was worse than being in jail,” Stein says. The remix was never released.


Looking back at their time together, Stein feels that it was wild and unpredictable, and yet Fela inspired him with his energy, bravery and philosophical outlook.


“People used to say to me: ‘Wow, it can’t be easy managing Fela.’ I’d explain that I never had any difficulty with him because we were friends. You can say anything to a real friend, so we never had a problem.”


But in 1997 Fela became gravely ill.


When Stein learned of his friend’s passing, he immediately boarded a plane to Lagos to join the mourners.


“On 11 August 1997 Fela was to be laid in state in Tafawa Balewa Square.


“The family arrived at the morgue to collect his body. I’d brought my electric razor and attempted to shave him and comb his hair. A big spliff was put in his right hand and he was placed in a glass coffin and carried in a hearse.


“He was laid to rest in front of his house, Kalakuta, in Ikeja on 12 August.


“His son, Femi, played a plaintive sax solo. A gentle rain fell like perfume. During those days no crime took place in Lagos.”

"People are threatening to kill Judy, hurt our children- Yul Edochie alleges","Controversial Nollywood actor and pastor, Yul Edochie, has announced an alleged plot by some persons to kill his second wife, Judy Austin, and harm their two children.


In November 2021, Judy welcomed a son named Star Munachimso with Yul and on 21st April 2022, the actor publicly unveiled her as his second wife.


Before the announcement, he married May for over 17 years, a union that produced four children: a girl and three boys.


May, who did not seem pleased with the union, revealed that her husband paid Judy’s bride price on 24 April 2022 without informing her and filed for a divorce in August 2023. Details of the court proceedings had been kept hush.


After he went public with news of his marriage to Judy, he fell out on social media with his fans and earned a large following of critics and sympathisers alike.







At the same time, he and Judy have also become the butt of internet jokes, especially on Facebook, where they host live videos and a mini-reality show of their personal lives.


But, these activities have earned him some die-hard enemies; at least, that is what his recent social media post suggests.


In a recent post, Yul claimed that those behind the plot created social media platforms to bully his fans, friends, and business associates.


Threat to life


He stated that the group, operating on WhatsApp, has been bullying and harassing others, even posting his home address and threatening his children and partner.




Yul said he has reported the matter to the police and is offering a one million naira reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.


He wrote on Instagram: “I heard a group of jobless and foolish people formed a WhatsApp group and social media pages, and they’re using them to threaten my fans, friends, and business associates.


Bullying is unacceptable to me or anyone else. I have reported the matter to the police. If anyone calls or texts you to threaten you, please record the call, copy the number and text, and send it to me so I can forward it to the police for tracking them.


“I heard they went as far as posting my house address on their platform & threatening to hurt my children & kill Judy. They have crossed the line. You can not sit in your house & tell another person how to live their life. God punish all of you. I will get you all.




“I’m offering N1 million and more to anyone who can provide helpful information about them to aid their arrest. To all my fans & friends all over the world, please assist me in apprehending these psychos. I thank you all for your love & support. God bless you. Cyberbullying is unacceptable.’’


He urged anyone receiving threatening calls or texts to record and forward the communication to him so he could assist the police in tracking down the perpetrators.


Yul called on everyone to join him in fighting this behaviour and ensuring that those responsible face consequences.

"I dont regret going into politics, Ill do it again  Funke Akindele","Nigerian filmmaker Funke Akindele has revealed reasons she will re-contest for political office.


The PDP governorship candidate in Lagos, Olajide Adediran, aka Jandor, picked Ms Akindele as his running mate in the 2023 general election.


During an interview on Arise TV’s Perspectives show, shared on YouTube Saturday, the mother-of-two spoke about political career.


The 46-year-old said: “So getting into politics was a big one for me. I enjoyed it, and I will do it again. I run a studio which I’ve been running since 2000. 


""I’ve been producing and working with many people, from crew members to cast. I have a Jenifa Foundation where we help nurture talent, and I bring on board many young talents.""




""We train them in filmmaking; they’re always on set, whether in the hair department, makeup, lights, or camera. It’s something I love doing—empowering young people and nurturing talent. 


""Some say Auntie is so strict, but she draws you closer when she’s strict, next to me. I love to uplift people; I can do it even better if I get into a larger space.


“For me, to have been doing it for years, let me try something big. Many young people complain, ‘We don’t have this’ or ‘This is going wrong.’ Let me come in to represent the youth. That is why I wanted to do it. 


""And that’s why I got into politics. Yes, I enjoyed every part of it. It was quite challenging, but I enjoyed every part of it. I felt so good representing the young people. It was challenging.”




She stated that changing Nigeria couldn’t be achieved in a day or four years, but political officeholders could plan startup initiatives.


Challenges


Ms Akindele recounted how she was accused of running for deputy governor because of popularity, money, and other personal gains.


She stated that during her campaign, she learned that people were going through a lot, hence the need to stand up for them.


“I love that private sectors are coming in, supporting the government. That is why we should focus more on supporting the government. Criticism is good, but how can you also support it? As a youth, how can you help yourself? What is that special gift in you that you have? You need to stand up and do something for yourself. So, getting into politics was a big one for me,” she said.




Reflecting on her challenges during the campaign, she said, “You had to hit the road, keep talking to people, and keep persuading them that you could do it. You had to delve into their issues and uncover the real problems people were facing—not just surface ones. 


""That’s when you realise people are enduring a lot in the country. You had to jot it all down and brainstorm how to offer solutions. It wasn’t something that happened overnight. You couldn’t just come in and declare, ‘I’m this, I’m that.’”


Jenifa Foundation


Furthermore, Ms Akindele maintained that she established the Jenifa Foundation to nurture young talent and build youth skills for a better Nigeria.


“Jenifa is so passionate about young people. In Jenifa’s diary, she has a salon; she’s always bringing in people. Jenifa believes in nurturing talent. I created the Jenifa Foundation, where we bring up young people. We train them in skills acquisition and vocational skills acquisition.




“We train them in filmmaking, which is more practical, and believing makes them believe in themselves. Confidence is essential. When people tell you you can’t do it, you must prove you can. You’re going to get a lot of negatives, a lot of no’s. People are negative out there,” she added.


She urged young, talented individuals to focus on pursuing their dreams amidst the storm.


According to her, they needed to be more sensitive about information consumption and shun procrastination, which she described as a big problem.



Films


The actress and director revealed that there will be a sequel to ‘A Tribe Called Judah’, her 2023 film that grossed over N1 billion at the box office.




She thanked God and her fans, acknowledging that she initially doubted the movie’s potential for broad acceptance.


Ms Akindele highlighted that her upcoming film ‘Finding Me’ explores the journey of self-discovery for individuals.


“Who are you? What do you want? How do you want to live your life? Do you want to live your life based on what people say, based on what the family says? That is what ‘Finding Me’ is all about.”


Ms Akindele, a lawyer, announced that she will be venturing into biopics and epic movies in 2026.

"Davido, Chiomas thrilling love story","Today, Tuesday, June 25, 2024, will definitely open a new chapter in the ‘love story’ of pop star David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, and his partner, Chioma Rowland, as they walk down the aisle in a blaze of glory.


Davido had, last Tuesday, confirmed his white wedding to his partner, Chioma, billed to be held today in Lagos.


The confirmation was a follow-up to their traditional wedding, which took place in 2023. Though the venue of the fairytale wedding is yet to be confirmed, there are, however, indications that it will either take place at the Harbour Point or Eko Hotel, both on Victoria Island, Lagos.


Notwithstanding the venue of the high-profile wedding, fans of the ‘unavailable’ crooner have been expressing their unalloyed support and happiness for Davido and Chioma, whose love story runs like a novel.


Sources close to the couple have confirmed that celebrities within and outside the shores of the country are expected to grace the high-profile wedding, whose attendance is strictly by invitation.




The pop star’s wedding is coming up amid his legal tussle with his baby mama, Sophia Momodu, over the custody of their 9-year-old daughter, Imade.


Davido reportedly, through his lawyers, had asked the court to grant him joint custody of their daughter, who was born in May 2015. But for anything, the pop star seems to be happier with Chioma and has always displayed his public affection for her whenever an opportunity to do so presents itself.


In a video shared by UK-based Nigerian Pastor, Tobi Adeboyega, an excited Davido could be heard inviting people to the wedding.


“Guys, you have to come to Nigeria on the 25th (of June) for my wedding,” he said.




At the weekend, the Afrobeat singer set social media agog, after he shared pre-wedding photos with Chioma on his Instagram page, ahead of their wedding, today, with the hashtag #CHIVIDO2024. He didn’t stop at that, the ‘Aye’ crooner also surprised Chioma with a bridal shower party on Sunday night.


In one of the clips of the videos that surfaced online, the chef was captured narrating how her fiancé planned the party without her knowledge.


She explained that Davido lured her out of the house by telling her that they were going for a dinner date but it turned out to be her bridal shower.


“Let me tell you a story. I know this is an event centre and David said we were going to eat.




“He was trying to get the exact location and when we got outside, he asked somebody something and I said, ‘This is not a restaurant. I’m hungry, I want to eat.’ Then I saw balloons, I just started screaming,” she enthused.


As they walk down the aisle today, it’s instructive to relive memories of how their love story began in earnest and the hurdles they had to cross to cement their relationship.


Recall that Davido and Chioma met in 2013, as students of Babcock University. While the singer pursued a degree in music, his fiancee was a student of Economics. At first, they were just friends till 2015, when they started playing hide and seek game. But they couldn’t be called lovers, until 2017, after the pop star officially unveiled Chioma to the world as his girlfriend.


Proving his love for his partner, Davido didn’t only write a song for her but he also convinced Chioma to star in his music video titled “Assurance.”




The relationship was flourishing and Chioma who happens to be Davido’s third baby mama was blessed with a son, on October 20, 2019, Ifeanyi Adeleke, but unfortunately, three after, the lad got drowned in a swimming pool at his father’s residence in the Banana Island area of Lagos, leaving Davido and his partner heartbroken.


It would also be recalled that the “If” singer had initially proposed to her. The wedding was set to take place in July 2020 but was put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic that was ravaging the world then.


Not until February 2021, when it was reported that the lovebirds had split up. The supposed breakup was spurred by loved-up photos of Davido and Instagram model Yafai on holiday in the Caribbean.


This was followed by a series of loved-up photos of the two that broke the internet in March 2021.




Besides, there were rumours of Davido having a fourth baby mama, leading to the lovebirds unfollowing each other on Instagram.


The development heightened fears that all was not well with Davido and Chioma. Before their critics could blink their eyes, the lovebirds found each other again and were not only able to reconcile their differences but also rekindle their love.


The internet was agog after a video of Chioma attending Davido’s concert started trending online.


The lovebirds reportedly left the venue together! Fans were over the moon and for people who’ve always shipped their relationship, they had better news for them. In that reconciliation spirit, Davido gifted Chioma a new Mercedes G-wagon.




The gift came in just a week after the singer had revealed that he’d be walking down the aisle with Chioma come 2023.

Of language and copyright: The case of Team Eternity and Hallelujah Voices Defe Defe,"This article critically analyses the copyright claim made by Kwame Mickey between TeamEternity Ghana and Kwame Mickey over the song’s chorus, allegedly composed by Osuani Afrifaand performed by Hallelujah Voices in 2004. 


It focuses on whether the phrase “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe” is copyrightable and if the similarities between the songs constitute substantial similarity under Ghanaian law. The article examines the necessary legal criteria for proving copyright infringement, discusses potential defences, and considers how Ghanaian courts might look to Commonwealth jurisprudence for guidance.


Ultimately, the resolution of this dispute will significantly impact the understanding of copyright protection for unique phrases and expressions in Ghana’s musical compositions.


Background on Intellectual Property Law


The progress of society relies on the creation of new ideas and inventions, including cars, songs, airplanes, washing machines, and computers among others. Intellectual Property (IP) includes creations of the mind, and IP law safeguards the rights of creators of inventions, writings, music, designs, and other works. IP law encompasses areas such as copyright, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. This article focuses specifically on copyright law.




According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), copyright is a legal term describing the rights creators have over their literary and artistic works. These works include books, music, paintings, sculptures, films, computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings. A fundamental principle of copyright law is that ideas in and of themselves, are not subject to protection. Copyright law, however, does provide protection for the specific manner in which an idea is expressed. It is this original ""expression"" of the idea that the author is entitled to exclusively own and prohibit othersfrom reproducing. 


Copyright law serves to balance both private and public interests. The private interest pertains to the author's right to benefit from their creative efforts. The public interest involves the dissemination and utilization of works by the public. Under copyright law, an author is granted two types of rights: Economic Rights and Moral Rights. Economic Rights encompass the exclusive right to receive compensation for the use of their work, such as the collection of royalties for the public performance of their music. Moral Rights include the right to be credited for their work whenever it is used and the right to object to, and seek redress for, any distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work.


Generally, a person or an agency is required to obtain permission or consent to use copyrighted material belonging to a third party. However, there are exceptions to this requirement, such as fair use, which includes uses for scholarship, non-commercial research, private study, commentary, criticism, teaching, review, and news reporting. An author’s rights are protected for the duration of their life plus seventy years after their death. 


For joint works, rights are protected for seventy years after the death of the last surviving author. If a public corporation or other body corporate owns the copyright, protection lasts for seventy years from the creation or first publication date, whichever is later.




For anonymous or pseudonymous works, rights are protected for seventy years from the creation, first public availability, or first publication date, whichever is later. If the author’s identity is revealed before the expiration of this period, the rights are protected for the author’s life plus seventy years after their death. Ghanaian jurisprudence on copyright is limited due to a lack of case law on the subject and the narrow nature of the country’s copyright law.


Legal criteria for copyright infringement


To succeed in an action for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove the followingelements


(1) Ownership of the copyright in the work. This involves demonstrating that the work is original and qualifies for copyright protection under the Copyright Act, 2005 (Act 690).




(2) Eligibility for copyright protection. The work must fall within the categories of works protected under the law (e.g., literary, musical, artistic works, etc.) and must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression.


(3) Proof that the defendant had access to the plaintiff ’s work and that the defendant’s work is substantially similar to protected aspects of the plaintiff ’s work. This is particularly important for works with similar content.


(4) Evidence that the defendant copied the work without the plaintiff ’s authorisation, showing that the defendant had access to the plaintiff ’s copyrighted work or demonstrating that the defendant’s work is substantially similar to the plaintiff ’s.


(5) Proof that the defendant performed acts reserved for the copyright owner without permission, such as reproduction, distribution, public performance, broadcasting, creation of derivative works based on the original, or adaptation of the work.




Establishing these elements allows the plaintiff to seek remedies such as injunctions, damages, accounting for profits, and the delivery of infringing copies. The defendant may raise defences like fair use, independent creation, derivative works, or argue that the work is in the public domain to counter the infringement claim.


The issue between Team Eternity and Kwame Mickey


The issue between Team Eternity and music producer Kwame Mickey hinges on whether the term and phrase 'defe defe' is copyrightable and whether there are substantial similarities between the two works that constitute an unauthorised act by the Team Eternity, which cannot be justified by fair use, derivative works, or public domain arguments.


Having listened to both songs, my assessment is as follows:









(1) The old song’s chorus goes: “Manhyia Nyame anka ..abonsam ay3 defe defe.”


(2) The new song’s chorus goes: “Manhyia Nyame anka way3 me defe defe.”


It is arguable whether this obvious similarity is substantial or unique.


Analysis of Substantial Similarity




Unfortunately, Act 690 does not provide explicit guidance on how to assess substantial similarity, making it difficult to predict a specific outcome with certainty. No legal action is currently pending before any court of competent jurisdiction. The author is expressing an academic opinion on a matter that has generated significant public interest and is not offering legal advice or encouraging any party to pursue court action based on these arguments.


Section 1 of the Act lists works eligible for copyright protection, including musical works and derivative works. However, Section 2 states that a work must meet two conditions to be eligible for copyright protection:


(a) It must be original in character.


(b) It must be fixed in a definite medium of expression, such as a book, which can be seen and felt.




While derivative works are based on or derived from existing works, they can still qualify for copyright protection if two conditions are met:


The author has added significant industry and skill to the original work.


The author has obtained the consent and/or permission of the original owner.


We can dismiss the argument regarding derivative work, as no author would raise copyright claims if proper permission and/or consent were obtained before publication. This leaves us to consider the issues of substantiality, uniqueness, fair use, or whether the work is in the public domain. For a work to qualify for copyright, it must be original in character. The bone of contention is whether the phrase “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe” (literally translated as “If not for God, the devil and/or the enemy would have completely destroyed me”) is copyrightable. The argument is that these are common Asante Twi phrases used by religious people, especially Christians, to show gratitude to God, and that any Christian artist or gospel songwriter may use it in their composition. Thus, no one can claim copyright ownership over such terms and phrases.





Origin of 'Defe Defe'


People knowledgeable in the Akan language cannot pinpoint when the word 'defe defe' entered the Akan Twi lexicon, but they agree it was not within daily contextual usage.


Anecdotal evidence suggests the Akan Twi common usage has been “pasaa” or “dosoo.” For instance, in Job 19:12, the word “pasaa” is used: “Mobeshe me kra akosi da ben, na mode nsem abubu me pasaa?” (How long will you poison my soul and break me in pieces with words?).


Anecdotal evidence suggests the word “defe defe” is a slang term that gained certainty with the song/performance by Hallelujah Voices in 2004. It is said that the song was written by Osuani Afrifa and produced under the supervision of Kwame Mickey for Kaakyire Music Productions.


Can Hallelujah Voices claim copyright over it?


Answering yes aligns with the school of thought that words or phrases or terms on their own may not be copyrightable. However, they gain the status of originality and are eligible for copyright protection when significant industry and skill have gone into turning them into unique lyrics, rhythm, sequence, pace, setting, and arrangement. The argument would be that although religious people, particularly Christians, may mention the name of God or praise God for redeeming them from the clutches of their enemies or the devil, it was not commonly put in the chorus by both Team Eternity and Hallelujah Voices, such as “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe” (If I had not met God, Satan would have completely and effectively destroyed me). This composition could be viewed as original and unique to the author and may qualifies for copyright protection.





Legal Tests for Substantial Similarity


The next issue to settle is whether Team Eternity’s “defe defe” song is substantially similar to that of Hallelujah Voices to raise copyright infringement claims. Since the Copyright Act does not provide guidance on this, we may refer to Commonwealth jurisdiction for inspiration and persuasive arguments. A competent court of jurisdiction will first filter out similarities that result from unprotectable aspects of the original work (the first “defe defe” song by Hallelujah Voices), and secondly, examine the “total concept and feel, theme, lyrics, rhythm, chorus, etc.” to determine whether the similarities rise to the level of “substantial.” Substantiality here is not only in terms of volume or quantity but in respect of even the hook of the song. That is why substantiality is further divided into two tests: “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” tests.


The intrinsic test is subjective and holistic. It involves determining whether the aspect of the plaintiff ’s protected work and the defendant’s work are substantially similar in total concept and feel. Here, we use the ordinary person on the street test. Will the person on the street of Makola or Kejetia market, upon hearing the two songs, say they are the same or not?


The extrinsic test will filter the two works (that of the plaintiff and the defendant). It will separate only those aspects that are copyrightable from those that are not and determine the similarities with the aspects that are copyrightable.


The copyrightable aspects of these two works come down to the chorus, which for me is the hook of the songs. The energy, zeal, excitement, glory, and what grabs the attention of many audiences, particularly religious people, is “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe.”


From both extrinsic and intrinsic perspectives, the ordinary man on the street of Makola market may conclude that they are similar and substantial.Those who argue they are not substantial may not consider the chorus as the hook of the two songs. 


The current case spotlights three distinct copyright infringement lawsuits against Ed Sheeran, one of the world's leading musicians.


In the first case, artist Sami Chokri, known as Sami Switch, alleged that Sheeran's 2017 hit ""Shape of You"" copied his 2015 song ""Oh Why."" Sheeran won the UK lawsuit, with the court ruling that he ""neither deliberately nor subconsciously copied"" Switch’s tune. The High Court acknowledged ""similarities"" between the one-bar phrase repeating ""Oh why"" in Chokri's song and ""Oh I"" in Sheeran's, but stated that such similarities are merely a ""starting point"" for a copyright infringement claim and highlighted ""significant differences"" between the phrases in the songs.


In the second case, Sheeran faced accusations of copying the R&B song ""Let’s Get It On"" inhis 2014 hit ""Thinking Out Loud."" The heirs of the song’s co-writer, Ed Townsend, claimed Sheeran unlawfully used the ""heart"" of Gaye’s song, specifically its ""harmonic progressions"" and ""melodic and rhythmic elements,"" rather than its lyrics or overall feel. Sheeran argued that these elements are common in popular music and not ""unique, original, or protectable.""


A Manhattan federal court jury ultimately found that Sheeran did not copy Marvin Gaye’s ""Let’s Get It On,"" despite recognizing similarities.





In another instance in 2017, the songwriters behind ""Amazing,"" performed by Matt Cardle, sued Sheeran, alleging he copied aspects of their track for ""Photograph."" Sheeran settled out of court, and the writers of ""Amazing"" were added to the credits of ""Photograph."" The plaintiffs argued that the chorus of both songs shared 39 identical notes and was crucial to the song, accusing Sheeran of intentionally copying it. Some, including Sheeran, argue that such lawsuits are becoming excessively frequent and harmful to the songwriting industry, especially considering the sheer volume of songs released daily. They claim there are only so many notes and chords available in specific genres, making coincidences inevitable. 


However, can the same be said for Ghana and its gospel music genre? Are there too many songs being released, leading to mere coincidences in similarities? Could it be possible that Team Eternity did not consciously reference a phrase from a song released twenty years ago? Others might argue that the older track has significant exposure on both traditional and social media, suggesting that Team Eternity must have encountered it before. All these factors need to be considered before rendering a verdict on copyright infringement.


In Kenya, in the case of Nonny Gathoni Njenga & Another v. Catherine Masitsa & Others, Civil Case No. 490 of 2013, the Plaintiffs (Nonny Gathoni and Jane Odewale) sought a temporary injunction from the High Court to prevent the Defendants (Catherine Masitsa, Standard Group Ltd, and Bauhaus Ltd) from infringing on their copyright of the literary work registered as ""Weddings with Nonny Gathoni,"" later televised as ""The Baileys Wedding Show with Noni Gathoni."" The Plaintiffs argued that the Defendants, without authorization, had illegally adopted, modified, and replicated significant parts of their literary works, thus infringing on their intellectual property rights. The Defendants contended that they had introduced their own wedding show, ""Samantha Bridal,"" prior to the Plaintiffs’ show, asserting that their work was independently created and copyrighted.


The court noted that the dispute was not about the existence of the Defendants' show but about the ""running order"" of the show. The Plaintiffs claimed that the Defendants had altered their previous format to closely resemble the Plaintiffs' show, thereby copying their unique running order. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs were unjustly attempting to monopolize common elements of wedding shows, such as hen parties, limousine rides, and host gifts, which do not constitute proprietary content.


The Plaintiffs presented side-by-side video comparisons to demonstrate the similarities between the shows. While certain common elements in wedding shows, like the use of a limousine, might seem obvious, the Plaintiffs insisted that the Defendants had consistently produced ""Samantha Bridal"" with a distinct format until they allegedly acquired the Plaintiffs' running order and made substantial changes to mirror it, presenting it as a novel format. The Kenyan Court determined that the Plaintiffs had established a prima facie case, fulfilling one of the conditions necessary for the granting of an interlocutory injunction. In the case of Rex Owusu Marfo (aka Rex Omar) v. Joy Industries Ltd decided on 17 June 2021, the Ghanaian Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision, awarding Rex Omar damages for copyright violation by Joy Industries Ltd. The court clarified that the appellant's use of the same tune or melody from the respondent's song in their advertisement, despite having different lyrics, constituted a copyright infringement. The court cited the legal principle that reproduction involves sufficient objective similarity and a causal connection between the works, concluding that the appellant's advertisement was a clear reproduction of the respondent's original song.





The court referenced the Halsbury's Laws of England and previous cases, emphasizing that copyright infringement is determined by the similarity in the essential elements of the works, such as melody and lyrical arrangement, regardless of differences in lyrics. The evidence presented, including musical notations and declarations, supported the finding that Joy Industries Ltd. had reproduced significant parts of Rex Omar's work. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, and the original judgment was upheld.


Furthermore, the court noted that earnings from the copyrighted work are irrelevant in determining damages for infringement. The right owner is entitled to damages simply upon proof of infringement, irrespective of financial gain from the work. The court underscored that copyright is a proprietary right, and the motive or intention behind the infringement does not affect the right owner's entitlement to damages.


The Rex Omar case highlights that substantial similarity between protected and allegedly infringing works, regardless of lyric differences, can constitute copyright infringement. This case sets a precedent in Ghana, showing how courts evaluate infringement claims based on shared elements. In Mickey's case, even though it focuses on lyrics rather than melody, established legal principles must be applied to determine if Team Eternity’s use of the disputed lyrics constitutes infringement. This framework will guide the interpretation of copyright law in Ghana and influence the outcome of potential claims.


Comparison with English and American Courts


Substantial Similarity: Both English and American courts and the Ghanaian court in Rex Omar’s case focus on whether the works share substantial similarities in protectable elements. The U.S. uses the ""ordinary observer"" test, while the UK assesses substantial copying based on the impression of an ordinary, reasonable person. Similarly, the Ghanaian court examined if the melodies were alike enough for an ordinary person to recognize the advertisement as derived from the original song.


Objective Similarity: English and American courts analyze specific similarities in structure, sequence, and arrangement, often using expert testimony. The Ghanaian court in Rex Omar's case compared melody, notation, and lyrical progression, using exhibits to show that the two works were the same.


Access and Copying: English and American courts require showing that the defendant had access to the original work and that the similarities are not coincidental. The U.S. sometimes infers access from widespread distribution. In the Rex Omar case, the court considered that Joy Industries Ltd had access to the song since the melody was used in a commercial advertisement, indicating awareness of the original work.


Originality Requirement: English and American courts require originality, meaning the work must originate from the author and have a minimal level of creativity. The U.S. threshold for originality is low but must be independently created. The Ghanaian court implicitly recognized Rex Omar’s composition as original and independently created, thus qualifying for copyright protection.


Damages and Infringement: In English and American courts, damages depend on the economic impact of infringement and the benefit to the infringer. Innocent infringement is not a defence but may affect the calculation of damages. The Ghanaian court awarded GHS230,000 in damages, emphasizing that the right owner is entitled to damages per se once infringement is established, regardless of economic earnings or the defendant’s intent.


Public Domain Argument: The argument of public domain may also be defeated because of the duration of copyright expiration over such works. It has only been twenty (20) years since the publication of thefirst song.


Conclusion


The current case highlights the nuanced considerations necessary to resolve the copyright issue between Team Eternity Ghana and Kwame Mickey over the song’s chorus, allegedly composed by Osuani Afrifa and performed by Hallelujah Voices. The Ghanaian courts will need to determine whether the phrase “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe” is original and sufficiently unique to qualify for copyright protection. They will also assess whether the similarities between the two songs are substantial and if they constitute an infringement of Hallelujah Voices’ copyright.


Given the lack of explicit guidance in Ghana’s Copyright Act on substantial similarity, the courts might look to Commonwealth jurisprudence for persuasive arguments. The analysis will involve both extrinsic and intrinsic tests to evaluate the total concept and feel of the songs. The intrinsic test’s subjective nature and the ordinary person’s perspective will be crucial in determining the outcome.


The argument that the phrase is a common Asante Twi expression used by Christians might be countered by the claim that its unique arrangement in the song is original and protected. The anecdotal evidence suggesting the phrase 'defe defe' is a relatively new coinage further complicates the issue.


Ultimately, while the facts seem to favour Hallelujah Voices in terms of originality and ownership, the final decision will rest on the evidence and arguments presented in court. The outcome will significantly impact the understanding of copyright law in Ghana, especially concerning the protection of unique phrases and expressions in musical compositions.


Broader Implications


The resolution of this case will have broader implications for the music industry in Ghana. It will set a precedent for how phrases and expressions, particularly those rooted in cultural and religious contexts, are treated under copyright law. Additionally, it will influence how new and existing musicians approach the creation and protection of their works.


The case also underscores the importance of having a more detailed and explicit legal framework for assessing substantial similarity in copyright disputes. Clearer guidelines would help creators understand the boundaries of their rights and the limits of permissible use of existing works. This would, in turn, foster a more vibrant and innovative artistic environment, encouraging originality while respecting the rights of existing creators.


Final Thoughts


The debate over whether the term “defe defe” and the associated chorus can be copyrighted is emblematic of the challenges faced in copyright law, where cultural expressions intersect with legal definitions of originality and creativity. As the courts deliberate, the music community in Ghana and beyond will be watching closely, aware that the decision will shape the future of copyright protection in the country.


In conclusion, the resolution of the copyright issue between Team Eternity and Kwame Mickey over the song’s chorus hinges on several nuanced legal considerations. The Ghanaian courts will need to determine the originality and uniqueness of the phrase “Manhyia Nyame anka .. yay3/abonsam /ay3 defe defe,” assess substantial similarity, and apply both extrinsic and intrinsic tests to reach a fair verdict. The outcome will not only resolve this specific dispute but also provide much-needed clarity and guidance for future copyright cases in Ghana.

"Champagne, caffeine and chaos: Fashion week descends on Paris","If you want to enter an alternate reality for six days, Paris Fashion Week is the place to do it.


When I board my Eurostar from St Pancras on a rainy Tuesday, I'm not sure what to expect from Menswear Spring/Summer 25.


The usual cohort of bleary-eyed commuters from London is this time interspersed with sunglass clad models and frazzled looking PR professionals, desperately trying to keep on top of their emails.

Paris is a changing city - despite being notorized for its art and romance, it has evolved over the decades into a savvy business hub, but one area it will always maintain its devotion to is being one of the greatest fashion scenes on the planet.


And Parisians take their commitment to the cause very seriously, as one stylist told me while surrounded by at least 15 Russian models: ""It's a fashion week afterparty, of course we have to go in wearing sunglasses.""




Louis Vuitton: Pharrell Williams takes over Unesco

Twice a year, designer brands from all backgrounds descend on the city and historic buildings are temporarily co-opted; all for the love of fashion.


One such building is the Unesco building, home to the unveiling of Louis Vuitton's new collection under the creative direction of Pharrell Williams.


As one of the most acclaimed luxury brands in the world, the anticipation at the show matches its surroundings.


Murmerings about star appearance echo the streets, as fans queue down the block, pressing against barriers and standing on tree trunks to catch a glimpse of the show's VIPs.




Pharrell Williams was appointed Louis Vuitton's Men's Creative Director in 2023Reuters


The front row includes Anna Wintour, Sabrina Carpenter, Burna Boy, Stormzy, Loyle Carner, Tems and Michael Fassbender.


The show celebrates athletic prowess, with reworked football jerseys throughout the designs and nods to the upcoming Olympic Games.


At the finale, Williams comes out looking jubilant, mobbed by a crowd of Louis Vuitton crew members wearing denim jackets emblazoned with “The World is Yours”.


Prototypes: Kanye West's favourite brand


If Louis Vuitton is a sophisticated older brother, Prototypes is its' rebellious younger sister.




Much like Louis Vuitton, Prototypes pulls its inspiration from the sports and a devotion to football which borders on religious.


The key difference here is that this younger sibling clearly spends her weekends deep in the Berlin clubbing scene. Prototypes is a brand that speaks to the alternative fashion movement.

Since its launch in 2021, it has collected star studded fans such as Playboi Carti and Noah Cyrus. As I sit waiting for the show to start, I ask a journalist why the show is running an hour late?"" She turns and says: ""You didn't hear? Because Kanye's coming.""


The controversial rapper has championed the brand since its inception. His public appearances with his wife, Bianca Censori, have caused a stir over the past few years and it has now been revealed that these looks have been the work of Prototypes designers.




This is no exception when the pair arrive at the Paris show: West's face was completely hidden in an outfit resembling a beekeeper, whilst Censori modeling a sheer nude bodysuit replete with pink hair.

Quiet luxury at Issey Miyake and System


By contrast, the shows at both Issey Miyake and System are dreamy and soothing.


System, a Korean brand known for its clean lines and modest layers, set stage at a construction site with high ceilings and mist machines.


The theme of Issey Miyake is 'Up, Up, and Away!' and the open air runway is ethereal, colourful and sophisticated.




The sophistication is what people expect, as I overhear on the way to the show: ""There won't be celebrities at Issey. It's a very elegant brand.""

A$AP Rocky's fashion week debut


A real highlight of the week is A$AP Rocky's off-calendar show. The rapper's creative agency AWGE host a show named ""American Sabotage"", which pushes the boat out even further, filling a French mansion with political posters and rap music.


Designs make pointed references to political discontent and social unrest. In a turn of events that is so ironic that it feels choreographed, despite being asked to arrive at 7pm, guests line the streets waiting to enter for almost an hour.


Being fashion week, many have chosen their outfits based on fashion over function and resultantly, are now standing around on the street in oversized jackets, head-dresses and impractically high heels.




As it's also mid-June, the sweat is kicking in and people are getting restless.

Tensions rise as a series of immaculately-clad punters show up, walk straight past the agitated queue and insist they are VIPs and should be let straight in. They are overheard saying: ""Surely I don't need to queue... right?"" as they confidently skip the crowds.


In true Parisian form, they are told the same thing as everyone else and sent straight to the back of the line, which now wraps around the block, past everyone they overtook.


The cherry on top of this deliciously entertaining cake happens when the ""l’éboueurs"" (bin-men) arrive and the smell of refuse that has been standing in the heat all day wafts through the queue.




When guests are finally let in, the show makes up for the blip tenfold, offering guests a multi-sensory experience, packed with glamour, activism, an impeccable soundtrack and politically charged cakes.

The second ever runway show from 032c magazine


Berlin-based culture magazine 032c invites guests to experience fashion week through the eyes of its co-founder Maria Koch. Koch transports the audience to an underground, glam-rock New York club in the nineties, under flashing lights and heavy bass lines.


Models with slicked back hair, sunglasses and heavy eye makeup donned leather, structured lines and sequins - crossing the lines between Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, David Bowie, and Neo from the Matrix.


The star studded runway line-up includes: Stella Maxwell, Yasmin Wijnaldum, Alex Consani and Gabbriette Bechtel, who recently announced her engagement to the 1975's Matty Healy at a Charli XCX chow.

Dries Van Noten's last ever show


The crown jewel of this season's fashion week is, no doubt, Dries Van Noten's final show. The designer's first show took place in 1991 and after 33 years of gradually becoming everyone's favourite, he announced this Menswear week would be his last.


Much of the chatter during the final days centred around how grand the final show would be, who would be in attendance, and whether there would be a dry eye in the house by the end.

As expected, the Belgian designer does not disappoint. I arrive at the venue on the outskirts of Paris, where usually quiet industrial streets are now filled with blacked-out taxis and supercars.


We move towards the vast warehouse that stands before us and I am reminded of a funeral procession. The atmosphere is palpable, as another journalist tells me: ""It's Dries Van Noten's final show. Are you ready to cry?""


As I enter the venue, I'm mesmerised by the sheer scale of it. In the centre of the room, which has ceilings that easily stand at three storeys tall, from floor to ceiling stands a huge cube.


Upon it, huge images of various runway shows over the years are projected. I am transfixed by his use of colour, movement and the joy on the faces of the models.


Images of Dries Van Noten's runways are displayed on a huge block in the centre of the room at the pre-show cocktail partyGeorgia Bell


This is a clear legacy show and the guest list at the cocktail dinner is living proof. As I overhear when I walk in: ""Oh my god. That's Diane Von Furstenburg. In the same room as Martin Margiela and Venus Williams. I think my head is about to explode.""


I walk through and scan the crowd around me and soon enough, my head too feels about ready to explode.


After Dries' generously warms up his guests on champagne, entrees and industry chatter, the lights dim and one of the huge curtains surrounding the back opened.


Voices of the thousands of attendees reduced to a hush and the room moved like a magnet towards the opening.


As I step through the entrance what stands before me blows my mind. The runway is like nothing I have ever seen: it is at least half a mile long and stands proudly, covered in aluminium taffetta.


The sheer distance of it obscures faces into pinpricks and the warehouse that houses it could easily house enough livestock to feed a small country.


Van Noten stands at the end of his enormous runwayEPA


As the show starts, a booming voiceover transports the audience to Van Noten's imagination.


The monologue muses about time, age, love and change.


The models Van Noten has selected mark the passage of time, some have been with the label since its early shows in the 1990s, such as Alain Goussin.


The designer is usually known to have models come down the runway playfully, sometimes even running or on bicycles. This time, they walk calmly and reflectively.

The looks include effervescent coats and suits, large distressed bags and gender-neutral shorts.


Some designs have a distinctly Japanese style, using a technique called ""suminagishi"", which layers ink onto water which is absorbed by the fabric and dates back 1,000 years.


Using this technique, Van Noten seamlessly combines shapes of flowers and fire - akin to the Japanese word for fireworks ""hanabi"".


The collection plays with soft, pastel tones and the occasional pop of Metallics - perhaps to symbolise Van Noten's transition into his golden years.

In a final press release, Van Noten comments: ""This is my 219th show; like the previous ones it looks ahead. Tonight is many things, but it is not a grand finale.""


Van Noten writes: ""I think about how Marcelo Mastroianni once spoke of a paradoxical “Nostalgia del futuro,” beyond the lost paradises imagined by Proust, and how we continue to pursue our dreams knowing that, at some point, we can look back on them with love.""


In their wake, models kick up the runway's foil, sending remnants swirling into the atmosphere, like the legacy left behind by Van Noten's career.


Dries Van Noten unveils a giant disco ball on his final farewell to Fashion WeekAndre Pain, EPA


On the grand finale, David Bowie's ""Sound and Vision"" plays out and I'm left stuck on the lyric: “Nothing to read. Nothing to say”, which seems to remark on Van Noten’s certainty that this is the right time to step away.


Ever humble, the designer keeps his goodbye on the runway brief, before revealing his last surprise for his guests: an enormous 1300kg two-storey rotating disco ball has been hidden behind curtains inside the centre of the cocktail room. Guests are invited to stay for the afterparty, as Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"" accompanies bubbling champagne bottles being popped.


Much like Dries Van Noten's last hurrah, Paris Fashion Week ends on a high and leaves us wanting more.

I want to continue acting till 90  Kanayo,"Nollywood veteran Kanayo O Kanayo has revealed his ambition to remain active in the film industry until he reaches the age of 90.


The 62-year-old actor shared his aspirations in a preview of an upcoming episode of the Honest Bunch podcast.


Kanayo also voiced concerns about what he sees as the “influx of untalented women” into Nollywood.


The actor and producer did not shy away from addressing other issues plaguing the industry, including drug abuse and homosexuality.


“Many girls are desperate to act. You don’t come to Nollywood to learn how to act. Acting is natural. If it’s not in you, go and sell crayfish,” Kanayo asserted.




He also highlighted the presence of drug use among actors and what he referred to as “unnatural” behaviours, specifically referring to homosexuality.


“For men who have unnatural… When I say unnatural in law, you should understand it to be when man dey sleep with man and all those things. (E dey happen for the industry?) Of course,” Kanayo remarked.


“Are you aware most artistes are on drugs?” he added, calling for a purge of certain elements from the industry. “I want a situation where at 70, 75, 80, 90, I will still be acting.”


This is not the first time Kanayo has spoken out about the challenges within Nollywood.




Recall last year, he claimed some individuals joined the industry to “sell sex” and warned against the movie industry becoming a platform for those involved in the sex trade and homosexuality.


Kanayo also recently introduced his first son, Clinton, to filmmaking, indicating a desire to pass on his legacy to the next generation.

+233 to host concert for Jon K,"Twenty-five years have flown by since Ghanaian music producer, keyboardist, singer-songwriter, and recording artiste, John Asante Opoku, better known as Jon K, passed on and a concert will be held in his honour at the +233 Jazz Bar & Grill in Accra on July 20, 2024.


The man was a broad-minded and forward-looking figure whose own works and contributions to the products of numerous others, helped enrich popular music in Ghana and beyond in the late 1980s and 1990s.


He released three albums under his name: ‘Adowa’ (1987), ‘Asaboni’ (1989) and ‘Gidigidi’ (1993). Jon K also produced albums for other acts such as Ben Brako, Frank Bafy, Thomas Frimpong, Mr Cee, Nana Bugyei, Western Diamonds, Paddy Hayes, Peejay Scott and more.


Artistes scheduled to perform at the memorial concert on July 20 include Bessa Simons and the Bessa Band, Pozo Hayes, Joe Osei, Okyeame Kwame, Pauline Oduro and Amandzeba.


L-R: Okyeame Kwame, Amandzeba and Bessa Simons


Jon K died on July 19, 1999 in a London hospital where he had been rushed after collapsing in a recording studio while producing singer, Nana Yaa’s debut album.




A product of Adisadel College in Cape Coast, Jon K was active in school bands. He joined the professional ranks in the late 1970s as keyboardist for trumpeter Eddie Quansah’s Tabu band which was praised for formulating a unique approach to African Jazz.


After moving to London, Jon K worked mostly from Sultan Sound Studio at Kilburn with his Kenyan-born British producer friend Dave Yowell. His debut album, ‘Adowa’ came out in 1987 and projected him as a well-grounded musician who had brought a brilliant fusion of African rhythms and Western electronic melodies to the London music soundscape.


What many found intriguing about the ‘Adowa’ album was the fine tribute Jon K paid to the Highlife heritage by embracing compositions from three of the genre’s early advocates: Kobina Okai (Akwankwaa Hiani), Dokyi Apenteng (Wofa Nono) and Stan Plange (Eno Brebre).


Ghanaian writer, filmmaker, and creative entrepreneur, Dr Kwesi Owusu who knew Jon K way back at Adisadel College, described ‘Adowa’ as: “Hi-tech Highlife fusing traditional rhythms and Soul music facilitated by Jon K’s mastery of studio technology and his quest for a new sound.”




Bessa Simons, president of the Musicians Union of Ghana (MUSIGA), who worked alongside Jon K on some projects in London, said the man was worth celebrating for his unmistakable style that set standards that were warmly embraced and are still cherished.


“He constantly drew on his exceptional skills that helped extend the creative abilities of the artistes he produced in the studio. He totally understood the music production process and worked out ways to enhance what he did for himself and for others.”


The July 20 concert is being organized by +233 Jazz Bar & Grill in collaboration with Jon K’s family and MUSIGA.

My daughter inspired me to write Kadosh  Joe Mettle,"Renowned gospel musician Joe Mettle has opened up about the inspiration behind his song, Kadosh.


In an interview on Daybreak Hitz with host Andy Dosty, Joe Mettle shared how his wife and newborn daughter significantly shaped his writing in music.


According to Joe Mettle, the birth of his daughter sparked a divine inspiration.

When the Holy Spirit spoke to him about his child's purity, he recalled, “Do you think this child is pure? And I said yes, her purity cannot be compared to mine and how Holy I am.”




Joe Mettle also revealed that he wrote the song without knowing the meaning of Kadosh, which he later discovered means ""the Holiness of God"".


He also shared that the original voice note of the song features his baby's sounds, adding a personal touch to the track.


The ‘Me Dan Wo’ singer also acknowledged his wife's contribution to one of his songs, stating that she had valuable input despite not being released yet.

WADEMOS launches Democreatives in Nigeria,"The West Africa Democracy Solidarity Network in collaboration with Ghana Centre for Democratic Development, Africtivistes, Awo Hub, and Yiaga Africa, has launched ‘Democreatives.’


‘Democreatives’, an initiative aimed at leveraging the power, influence and resources of creatives in the West Africa sub-region to promote and defend democracy, was launched in Lagos, Nigeria on Friday, June 21, 2024.


The programme had in attendance creatives from various countries in the sub-region who shared ideas on how they can amplify activism towards democratic consciousness. 


There was also a panel discussion with creatives such as playwright and poet, Chief Moomen (Ghana); rapper MI Abaga (Nigeria), rapper Sister LB (Senegal); artist and journalist Ben Osar Youssouf Barry (Senegal) and Yemi Adamolekun (CSO leader in Nigeria). It was moderated by Cynthia Mbamalu from Yiaga Africa. 





The discussion was based on spotting the opportunities and challenges in advancing the cause of democratic awareness. 




Nigerian disc jockey, DJ Switch, who was very instrumental in the #EndSars movement, highlighted the influence of creatives in creating democratic consciousness, in her keynote address. Ghana’s Grammy-nominated artiste Rocky Dawuni, also sent in his message, admonishing players in the culture and creative industries to be proactive in taking part in democratic activities that will ensure to the benefits of the citizens. 





In his address, Dr. Kojo Pumpuni Asante, the Director of Advocacy and Policy Engagement at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) stressed the need to use creatives to advance the cause of democracy. 


He also spoke to Joy FM on the sidelines of the launch about prospects of the initiative.


“All across Africa, there are huge governance challenges. Young people in their millions are feeling despondent. They feel that even democracy is not working. It’s not delivering the dividends that will improve their welfare. So  some people say ‘why don’t we get military governments?’ 




I think everybody believes that every true society that will be developed and sustained needs to have right to expression and freedom. So there is not alternative to democracy. But what we have to do is recognise the problem and confront it. One of the best ways to do this is use every necessary resource we have in society, and an area we have neglected is the use of our creatives. 


If the people have so much influence in terms of their music, their art, how can they also raise their voice to address some of these challenges and move people so that we can begin to overcome the challenges,” he told Joy FM. 





Asked what activities and initiatives have been tabled in their roadmap for this agenda, Dr. Asante said more interactions with the creatives will spawn subsequent actions.


“We see this launch as a conversation starter, a movement. We have created a platform for creatives and other activists to come together to see how best to work together,” he said.




These, he believes, could be achieved through a series of targeted workshops, collaborative campaigns, public forums and concerts.


The launch of Democreatives sought to provide creatives with the knowledge and tools necessary to understand and engage with democratic processes, to create collaborative platforms for artistic expression focused on governance and civic issues, and inspire and facilitate active citizenship and political accountability by the creative community.


It was also aimed at deepening our understanding of the context, role, and opportunities for creatives in West Africa and to leverage the abilities, skills and talents of creatives for democratic consolidation and the promotion of democratic norms and values in West Africa.


Paul Osei Kuffour, Network Coordinator of WADEMOS, did a presentation on the dwindling fortunes of democracy in West Africa and why creatives must get involved.




There was a presentation of a set of artistic drawings based on discussions at the event, a performances by Awo Hub, Killa Ace (Gambia) and Sister LB (Senegal).


Background 


In recent years, the global landscape of democracy and governance has faced numerous challenges. From the erosion of civil liberties to the rise of authoritarianism, the need for an informed and active citizenry has never been greater. 


The West African, Central African, and Sahel regions have witnessed nine coups since 2020. The coup in Niger is the latest challenge thrown at the sub-region, bringing to four the number of countries in francophone West Africa undergoing political transition. These series of setbacks have reversed the gains made at consolidating democracy and good governance and have highlighted the challenges to stability and cooperation within the regional organization. 




A September 2022 Afrobarometer poll indicated a decline in support for democratic elections in 26 of the 30 African countries surveyed between 2011 and 2021. This trend extends to nations with historically stable electoral processes, such as Ghana and Nigeria.


Creatives play a crucial role in reflecting societal values, inspiring change and proposing alternative solutions by using arts to express their opinions, perspectives, and experiences on socio-political issues, such as democracy, human rights, corruption, development and culture. Through arts, creatives can raise awareness, challenge stereotypes, and inspire societal change. Again, creative arts create spaces for participation, interaction, and collaboration among different stakeholders in society- artists, activists, policymakers, politicians and citizens.


Creatives have, through their skills, talents and products, tackled the exercise, maintenance, and dynamics of power through a variety of artistic means. This political and civic consciousness that influences their artworks increasingly defines African art as citizens seeking the dividends of democracy and demanding improved democratic governance and good leadership.


West African youth, most notably young women and creatives, have been at the forefront of several protests and movements against democratic backsliding and bad governance, pushing against violations of democratic norms and values. In recent years and over the past months, several notable mobilizations, including the EndSARS protests in Nigeria – which saw the involvement of many creatives, the Y’en a Marre and Balai Citoyen movements in Senegal and Togo.




In 2020, Yiaga Africa and the African Movement for Democracy created an album titled ""Music as a Messenger of Democracy"" that uses music to encourage young people to get involved in politics. 


This pan-African project features musicians from Senegal, Mali, The Gambia, Togo, Nigeria, and Benin and addresses issues including corruption, peace, and good governance.


Despite the potential and efforts of creative arts and the creative industry, it has not effectively positioned itself to address the perennial democracy and governance challenges across West Africa and the sub-region and there has been a lack of collaboration between creatives and other democracy champions. 


The disconnect between creatives and everyday governance issues limits the promotion of citizen mobilization and accountable governance.

Taylor Swift takes selfie with Prince William and children George and Charlotte,"The Prince of Wales has thanked Taylor Swift for a ""great concert"" as he shared a photo of the pop superstar taking a selfie with him and his children George and Charlotte.


Watching the US singer perform at Wembley Stadium, the future king was also spotted shaking his arms to Shake It Off as he celebrated his 42nd birthday.


""Thank you Taylor Swift for a great evening,"" Prince William wrote on Instagram.


Swift posted her selfie with William, George and Charlotte alongside her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce.


""Happy Bday M8,"" Swift wrote on Instagram. ""London shows are off to a splendid start.""







William's cousin Zara Tindall and her husband Mike Tindall were among the star-studded crowd, which reportedly included Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan and model Cara Delevingne.


Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was also present as he took time off from the campaign trail to attend the first night of the London leg of Swift's record-breaking Eras tour.





Prince William previously shared the stage with Swift and Jon Bon Jovi for a performance of Livin' On A Prayer for a charity event at Kensington Palace in 2013.


Swift is performing three gigs at the 90,000-capacity London venue this weekend - on Friday, Saturday and Sunday - before returning to the venue for a further five in August.




London has been overtaken with Taylor-mania in recent days, with the city's iconic Tube map redrawn to celebrate her arrival.


Her hit Shake It Off was also played at the traditional Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Friday.


On Thursday it was revealed that Swift's fans were expected to boost the London economy by £300m as the capital hosts more Eras Tour shows than any other city in the world, with nearly 640,000 people expected to attend across the eight dates.

OFM requests YouTube to mute Team Eternitys Defe Defe over copyright,"Music Record Label, OFM Computer World, has asked YouTube to pull down Team Eternity Ghana’s hit song ""Defe Defe"" over alleged copyright infringement.


 In a letter to the platform, the record label stated that the popular song reused portions of the original copyrighted song ""Defe Defe"" by Hallelujah Voices without their permission.


As such, they have requested that the platform change the song's visibility to prevent individuals from accessing it ahead of pending legal action.


“But before any legal action is taken in Ghana’s capital city court, I request YouTube to make the video private, not visible since its copyright infringement,” the label said.


This was contained in a letter signed by OFM Computer World on June 20.




The letter also asserted that the music group often sampled songs by other musicians without the owners' permission.

On June 18, in a Facebook post, Kwame Mickey, the executive producer for Hallelujah Voices’ ‘Defe Defe’, alleged that Team Eternity Ghana has infringed on his copyright by using the ‘defe defe’ line for their new hit song.


He wrote: “Who is that Defe Defe singer? If I start right now them go say I am 'mansonia'. What is the difference between the two songs? Somebody tell her to report and do the needful. That’s all.” 


Although structurally, the rhythmic patterns and melodic phrases of the two lines are different, Kwame Mickey is making a case for the similarities in the lyrical content.




'Defe Defe' song performed by Hallelujah Voices, was written by Osuani Afrifa and executively produced by Kwame Mickey for Kaakyire Music Productions. It was released in 2004.


The recent copyright issue has sparked a lot of debate. While some argue that Team Eternity's ""Defe Defe"" is different from Hallelujah Voices' song, others contend that the mere fact that two lines are literally the same constitutes copyright infringement.





Meanwhile, Team Eternity is yet to officially respond to the copyright allegations.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.
