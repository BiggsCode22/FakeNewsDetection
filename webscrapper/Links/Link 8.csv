""We remain committed to implementing our strong reform programme, towards ensuring macroeconomic stability.”

This comes after the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wrapped up its second review of Ghana’s US$3 billion, 36-month Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement.


Approved back in May 2023, this review was a critical checkpoint for the country.


The completion of this review meant an immediate disbursement of roughly $360 million, bringing Ghana’s total disbursements under the arrangement to about $1.6 billion.




In a meeting, Deputy Managing Director Kenji Okamura announced, “Ghana’s performance under its ECF-supported reform program has been generally strong.


The authorities’ strategy aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and reducing debt vulnerabilities is paying off, with clear signs of stabilisation emerging.”

IMF commends Ghanas strong economic reforms as $360m aid boost arrives,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had just wrapped up their second review of Ghana’s US$3 billion, 36-month Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement. 


Approved back in May 2023, this review was a critical checkpoint for the country. 


The completion of this review meant an immediate disbursement of roughly $360 million, bringing Ghana’s total disbursements under the arrangement to about $1.6 billion.


In a meeting, Deputy Managing Director Kenji Okamura announced, “Ghana’s performance under its ECF-supported reform program has been generally strong.


 The authorities’ strategy aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and reducing debt vulnerabilities is paying off, with clear signs of stabilisation emerging.”




Ghana’s economic reform program had indeed been delivering on its objectives. After facing severe economic and financial pressures in 2022, the IMF-supported program provided a credible anchor for the government. 


It helped in adjusting macroeconomic policies and implementing reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The foundations for higher and more inclusive growth were being laid.


“These efforts are paying off,” Okamura noted. “Growth is proving more resilient than initially expected, inflation is declining at a faster pace, and both fiscal and external positions are improving.”


Despite some delays, Ghana has made significant progress on key structural reform milestones. The Ghanaian authorities were also moving forward with their comprehensive debt restructuring. 




On June 11, 2024, they reached an agreement with Ghana’s Official Creditor Committee (OCC) under the G20’s Common Framework on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), formalising an agreement in principle on debt treatment.


Kenji Okamura highlighted, “This agreement on a debt treatment, consistent with program parameters, provided the necessary financing assurances for the second review under the ECF Arrangement to be completed.”


Moreover, Ghana’s primary fiscal balance had improved by over 4 per cent of GDP last year. 


The authorities were committed to further advancing fiscal consolidation, aiming for primary fiscal surpluses of ½ per cent of GDP this year and 1½ per cent of GDP in 2025.




“These efforts are underpinned by reforms to bolster revenue mobilisation and streamline non-priority expenditures,” Okamura explained. 


“The authorities are also expanding social protection programs to mitigate the impact of fiscal adjustment on the most vulnerable.”


The Bank of Ghana (BoG) maintained a prudent monetary policy stance to sustain a rapid reduction in inflation and took steps to rebuild international reserves. 


They had also strengthened measures to preserve financial sector stability, ensuring the implementation of banks’ recapitalization plans. 




The Ministry of Finance had begun recapitalising state-owned banks in line with available resources.


“Ambitious structural reforms to create an environment more conducive to private sector investment, and to enhance governance and transparency are gaining prominence,” Okamura said. 


“These will be key to boosting the economy’s potential and underpin sustainable job creation.”


Looking ahead, sustaining macroeconomic policy adjustment and reforms was essential, especially during the upcoming electoral period. 




Kenji Okamura concluded, “Perseverance in macroeconomic policy adjustment and reforms is crucial to fully restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while fostering a sustainable increase in economic growth and poverty reduction.”


Ghana’s journey was far from over, but the progress made under the IMF-supported program was a testament to their determination and commitment to economic stability and growth.

Cedi to stabilise against dollar from July after debt restructuring deal  Dr Adu Sakordie,"Economist Dr Adu Owusu Sakodie has said he expects the cedi to make some gains from July this year following the conclusion of the debt restructuring deal with external creditors.


He is hopeful the local currency will respond favourably as the market receives the good news about Ghana concluding the debt deal.


“It often takes some time for this development to impact the market and that is why the cedi has not recovered strongly yet”, he said.





He explained that there is normally a lag period for the market to react to the news.


“I believe that in July 2024, we will be seeing some positives for the Ghana cedi when it comes to its performance against the dollar” he expressed optimism.  




He spoke on PM Express Business Edition with host George Wiafe on June 27, 2024.


Some analysts had attributed the recent depreciation of the cedi to delays in concluding the debt restructuring deal.


“We are expecting the local currency to recovery strongly, after the bondholders sign the agreement on the debt restructuring in the coming weeks”, he maintained.


Debt restructuring deal and the economy




Dr Sarkodie observed that the development will go a long way to help in the recovery of the Ghanaian economy.


“This is because we are expecting investors to also respond accordingly to this development and that could help deal with the confidence issues as well”, he said.


He is of the view that the deal will give government some fiscal space to help managers of the economy channel the country’s resources to other critical sectors of the economy.


Businesses and the Debt Restructuring Deal




Speaking on the same programme, the President of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GNCCI), Dr Clement Osei Amoako welcomed the progress made in restructuring the external debt.


“This will help to restore investor confidence in the economy, looking at what has happened over the past two years”.


“Businesses have struggled over the years, from high interest, soaring inflation and depreciation cedi, and not so favourable business environment”, he said


He described the development as a big relief for businesses, particularly manufacturers.




“We are also expecting the Ghana cedi to respond positively to this development, as we have already seen some marginal stability and we want that to continue”.


He, however wants Government to institute the structures that will aid fiscal prudence after the debt restructuring deal.


“We are worried about past developments, but we believe that government has learnt their lessons when it comes to the economy”.

Weve gone past the era of price controls  GNCCI President tells Trade Minister,"The President of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GNCCI), Dr Clement Osei Amoako has appealed to the Minister of Trade and Industry, K.T Hammond to take a second look at plans to control cement pricing in the country.


“As a country, we have gone past the era of controlling prices. I don’t think that is the way to go”, Dr Amoako said on PM Express Business Edition with host, George Wiafe on June 27, 2024.


He argued that price control is an economic model that will not work in the cement manufacturing business.


“People have invested in their business, produced a commodity and you want to determine how much that commodity should be sold”, he quizzed.


He stressed that Ghana operates a free market system that allows market forces to determine prices and not the government.




“We have all come to accept now that, we are a free market economy and therefore let’s allow forces of demand and supply to determine prices”.





Background


Mr Hammond this week introduced a legislative Instrument to help prevent cement manufactures from exploiting the public. Under the proposed legislative instrument, cement manufactures could face up to three years in jail for failing to comply with this legislation. 


In May 2024, Mr Hammond instructed the Cement Manufacturing Development Committee (CMDC) to direct cement manufacturing companies in Ghana to immediately reverse the hike in prices.




However, the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) rejected the directive citing production costs and the principles of a free market economy, stating that the directive is ""without basis and justification.""


Impact of this move on the economy


Dr Amoako is however worried that the move by the Trade Minister may rather end up increasing prices on the market.


“There are a lot players on the market, and this could result in these players creating artificial shortage, and that could be worse than what the Trade Minister is trying to correct” he said.




“We should be careful how we go about this because it could backfire”, he warned.


Describing the Legislative Instrument as not business friendly, Dr Amoako said it is not the duty of government to regulate prices.


“Firms have invested so much in their businesses to produce goods and they are not being allowed to price right to make returns on their investments”.  


On the conclusion of the debt restructuring programme, Dr Amoako welcomed the progress made by government in reaching a deal with the creditors and Eurobond holders.  




“This will help to restore investor confidence in the economy, looking at what has happened over the past two years”.


“Businesses have struggled over the years, from high interest, soaring inflation and a depreciating cedi, and not so favourable business environment”, he said


He described the development as a big relief for businesses, particularly manufacturers.


“We are also expecting the Ghana cedi to respond positively to this development, as we have already seen some marginal stability and we want that to continue”.




He, however wants the government to institute the structures that will aid fiscal prudence after the debt restructuring deal.


“We are worried about past developments, but we believe that government has learnt its lessons when it comes to the economy”.  


The PM Express  programme


The programme looked at the impact of the debt restructuring deal and its effect on businesses and the economy at large.




Other panellists on the programme included  Partner at accounting firm, Deloitte, Yaw Lartey  and Economist Dr Adu Owusu Sarkodie.

"Petrol price to go up 2%, LPG by 5% from July 1, 2024  IES","The price of petrol is expected to go up by 2.0% from July 1, 2024, for the next two weeks, the Institute for Energy Security has revealed.


At the same time, the price of diesel will surge by 4.0%, whilst that of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) will shoot up by 5%.


The expected increase in fuel prices is due to the depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar and the increase in the prices of finished petroleum products on the international market.


“Following the negative price changes recorded on the international market for petroleum products adding to the consistent fall (-1.85%) of the Ghana Cedi, fuel prices at the local pumps are expected to surge. Considering the developments in the foreign fuel market and the domestic forex market, the Institute for Energy Security (IES) anticipates an increase in fuel prices in the first half of July 2024, on account of the worsening performance of the Ghana cedi”.


World Fuel Market




The IES said its monitoring of the global Standard & Poor's (S&P's) Platts on petroleum products performance in the world fuel market shows that the price of petrol, diesel, and LPG increased in the second pricing window for June 2024.


The published data for the second pricing window of June 2024 showed that petrol closed at $816.61 per metric tonne. Diesel went for $778.32 per metric tonne, and LPG closed at $477.80 per metric tonne. The net changes indicate that the price of petrol has increased by 1.45%, diesel by 6.84%, and LPG by 9.03%.


Local Fuel Market Performance


The IES daily monitoring of activities on the domestic fuel market for the second pricing window for June 2024 observed relative stability in the price for liquid fuels from Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).




Diesel and petrol sold at GH₡14.06 and GH₡14.26 per litre respectively, whereas LPG went for GH₡15.96 per kilogramme.

IPPs Chamber rejects Finance Ministers haircut claim,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Independent Power Generators, Ghana (IPPS), Dr. Elikplim Kwabla Apetorgbor, has dismissed the Minister of Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam’s assertion that the IPPs has agreed to a haircut after six years of negotiation with the Government of Ghana.


According to him, the Minister’s statement is misleading and inaccurate.


In a statement copied to Joy Business, he said, the last engagement of some IPPs with the Government of Ghana's negotiating team occurred in April 2024, and since then, no agreement on any terms has been reached.


“It has come to our attention that the Minister of Finance has made public statements indicating that a deal has been reached with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) regarding debt restructuring. We must categorically state that this assertion is misleading and inaccurate”.


“The last engagement with some of the IPPs and the Government of Ghana's negotiating team occurred in April [2024] and since then, no agreement on any terms has been reached. The posture and generalisation that the government has secured a debt restructuring agreement with the IPPs are misleading and amount to public deception”, he added.




“We urge the Minister of Finance to refrain from making such inaccurate statements and to engage in transparent and honest communications”, he pointed out.


He concluded that the IPPs remain committed to constructive dialogue and finding a mutually beneficial resolution to the ongoing discussions.


Joy Business understands that only two IPPs, CenPower and Amandi accepted the government’s proposal to restructure the IPPs' debt.


The rest, Karpowership, Twin City Energy, Sunon Asogli, Cenit Energy and AKSA rejected the haircut proposal by the Government of Ghana




The Finance Minister in a statement in London said the IPPs agreement includes accepting a reduction in their claims (haircut), allowing the government to spread payment over five years.


“The negotiations have been going on for six years, and I am happy to announce that last week, l closed the negotiations with the IPPs,"" he revealed.

We welcome Energy Ministrys directive on a single unified measurement system  CBOD,"The Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors' (CBOD) has welcomed the Ministry of Energy’s directive mandating all entities involved in revenue assurance measurements within the oil and gas sector to comply with the new standard.


This standard was primarily developed collaboratively by the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and other stakeholders.


According to the CBOD, it believes that a single unified measurement system certified by the GSA is sufficient to ensure accurate and reliable data.


It emphasised the importance of a streamlined and well-regulated oil and gas sector.


It therefore advocated for a system where the private sector plays a more prominent role in managing specific aspects with the government maintaining an overarching regulatory framework and enforcing standards.




“The Chamber proposes a standardized approach, where meters mandated by the GSA could be installed by either the Depot, the National Petroleum Authority (NPA), or the Ghana Revenue Authority. The GSA would be responsible for the regular calibration of the meters. This system aligns with international best practices, where standard authorities handle meter calibration, eliminating the need for duplication by several entities, which comes at a cost to the consumer”, it said


“The role of the GSA in ensuring and maintaining standards is in the best interest of the state. All regulations within the sector should ultimately serve the national interest and be subject to state/regulatory oversight”, it added.


The Chamber acknowledged GRA's quest to ensure revenue assurance for government.


Nevertheless, it said any institution, whether private or public, mandated to undertake that on government's behalf, should do so in compliance with standards set by both the GSA and the Ministry of Trade Industry to ensure a transparent and efficient measurement system within the oil and gas sector




It welcomed initiatives by the Ministry of Energy to lead further dialogue with relevant stakeholders and to ensure a transparent and efficient measurement system within the oil and gas sector.

IPPs have agreed to take a haircut after 6 years of negotiation  Amin Adam,"Finance Minister, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam has disclosed that government of Ghana has finalized a deal with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to restructure arrears following six years of negotiations.


According to the Finance Minister, the agreement includes the IPPs accepting a reduction in their claims (haircut), allowing the government to spread payment over a five year period.


“The negotiations have been going on for six years, and I am happy to announce that last week, l closed the negotiations with the IPPs,"" he revealed.


The Minister stressed that the deal, which has been closed with some four IPPs, has yielded significant fiscal relief.


“We have closed it, and we have restructured the arrears of the independent power producers in Ghana, particularly the four major independent power producers in Ghana, [in a way] that has brought us some significant haircut or discount and that now allows us to spread the balance over five years or above.”




Dr. Amin Adam also said that “the problem that Ghana’s energy sector is faced with is now under control. The ECG [Electricity Company of Ghana] managing director is here, and he will confirm that we will stop interruption in power supply in order to provide reliable power for industry to thrive, so we can support the growth efforts of our economy.” 


Ghana's energy sector 


Ghana’s energy sector is a debt making-machine, accumulating approximately $1 billion in debt annually, with around $500 million stemming from excess capacity charges.


According to a 2023 IMF assessment of Ghana’s energy sector, the West African nation has “almost doubled electricity tariffs over the past year to bring them close to the cost recovery level, but distribution and commercial losses persist.”




In fact, below-cost-recovery tariffs (usually as a result of exchange rate fluctuations), distribution and recovery losses, and excess capacity combined with take-or-pay contracts have led to large financial shortfalls over the past few years. By end-2022, the IMF estimated Ghana’s outstanding energy sector debt had reached $1.6 billion owed mainly to IPPs and fuel suppliers, and was nearing $2 billion.


In IMF’s assessment, “the government continued to accumulate payables during the first half of [2023], hence breaching the related program indicative target”.  It stressed that non-energy sector payables declined, but energy sector payables increased due to low recoveries in the sector, tight financing conditions, and pending negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs).


During foreign exchange crises, the energy sector faces challenges due to the majority of power generation costs being in dollars while revenue is primarily in cedis, resulting in significant exchange losses during debt settlements.


According to the World Bank, Ghana incurs losses of over $680 million yearly due to load shedding or power outages. The Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) recently disclosed that it issued over 100 power outage notifications in the first two and a half months of this year, primarily due to maintenance activities. 




Ghana's current peak demand has surged to 3,618 MW, significantly exceeding the available capacity of 3,251 MW. With an installed capacity of 5,626 MW, the nation is only utilizing approximately 58% of its total capacity, leaving a considerable deficit of 2,375 MW. This deficit is compounded by a 740 MW shortfall attributed to ongoing maintenance, further straining the electricity supply infrastructure.


Among the maintenance-related issues, 330 MW remains uncertain in terms of restoration timelines, adding complexity to the grid's stability. Additionally, 4 thermal plants, collectively capable of generating 595 MW, are offline due to inadequate fuel supply, while a fault in the TICO unit 3 plant has rendered 120 MW unavailable until December 2024, impacting the entire year's power generation by that capacity.


Consequently, Ghana faces a significant 1,455 MW shortfall in electricity generation capability, with gas supply limitations exacerbating the challenge. Despite efforts to reduce power exports by 40% during peak hours to prioritise local demand, the gap persists!


In December 2023, the Ghana Energy Commission warned of potential power outages due to fuel supply restrictions and planned maintenance issues, which could lead to a significant loss of dependable capacity in the country. The Commission estimated that Ghana would need to spend around $1.2 billion to purchase fuel for its predominantly thermal power plants, which contribute over 65% of the nation's dependable capacity.




Ghana traditionally relied on the West African Gas Pipeline (WAPCo) network to import fuel from Nigeria for its power plants. However, recent foreign exchange challenges and Ghana's inability to meet its debt obligations forced WAPCo to halt fuel supply to Ghana at the beginning of the year.


The Energy Ministry revealed that Ghana owed WAPCo approximately $19 million, and a payment of $10 million was required upfront to resume services. Despite this payment, Ghana has accumulated another debt, leading WAPCo to hesitate in continuing business relations with the country.


The hydroelectric landscape presents mixed outcomes, with the Akosombo dam maintaining a stable electricity generation due to its sufficient water levels, while the Bui dam's declining levels raise concerns. If the downward trend persists, the Bui dam's ability to generate power could be compromised, leading to its restricted usage to peak hours only.


To align generation capabilities with demand, Ghana resorted to implement power shedding measures, shedding 380 MW during normal times and an additional 505 MW during peak hours daily. The primary challenge remains the inadequate gas supply. Meanwhile, utilising idle thermal plants can partially offset the 505 MW shortfall during peak times caused by fuel shortages or equipment faults.

You have 21 days to clarify under-reporting of remittances  Dr Atuahene to BoG,"Banking Consultant Dr Richmond Atuahene has given the Bank of Ghana 21 days to clarify the significant gap between its data on remittance inflows to Ghana and the figures tracked by the World Bank.


According to Dr Atuahene, the central bank has been under-reporting total receipts from remittances, allowing some FinTech and other payment platforms to withhold significant forex to the detriment of the state.


In the space of remittances, available data from the World Bank and the Bank of Ghana have contrasted each other. While the World Bank tracked a total of about $20.7 billion as remittances inflow to Ghana from 2018 to 2022, the Auditor General’s  reports on the Bank of Ghana’s consolidated statements of foreign exchange receipts and payments within the same period tracked and accounted for only $9.5 billion, leaving a gap of some $11.2 billion.





Responding to the Bank of Ghana’s rejoinder on FinTech and remittances, Dr Atuahene stated that the central bank was under-reporting cash flows from remittances. 


He demanded that the bank provide data within 21-days to explain why the World Bank figures are relatively higher than those captured in the Audited General's forex report.

“I’m giving them 21 days because I have more data and I’m going to reveal it, because you cannot challenge the World Bank data, which I have confirmed,” he lamented. 


“You are under-reporting, and this under-reporting comes because of the role of the FinTech,” Dr Atuahene stressed while speaking on the AM Show on the JoyNews channel on June 26, 2024.


Atuahene argued that the apex bank’s rejoinder was baseless and failed to address the widening gap between remittance receipts it captured and those reported by the World Bank.


“So I'm giving them 21 days, let them retract it and let them get the data and the facts right. Other than that, I'll continue to release the data and explain the data to the public,” he demanded.

Government clinches preliminary $13bn debt deal with bondholders,"Government has reached an agreement in principle with two bondholder groups to restructure around $13 billion of its debt, it said on Monday, making it the second African country this month to reach the final stages of a debt overhaul.


The agreement will see Ghana's bondholders forego about $4.7 billion of their loans and provide cash flow relief of about $4.4 billion up until 2026 when the country's current International Monetary Fund programme ends.


""The formal launch of the consent solicitation is expected in the upcoming weeks,"" the government said, referring to the process of putting the proposal to all its bondholders which, if passed, would see the country emerge from default.


Details of the deal which will amount to a principle 'haircut' in bond market speak of as much as 37%, were first reported by Reuters on Thursday.


The IMF described the agreement as ""a significant positive step"" for Ghana. The committee representing its international bondholders said it would give the country a path to economic recovery.

OPTIONS


The deal comes hot on the heels of a recent agreement Ghana struck with its bilateral creditors and another slow-in-the-making restructuring in Zambia earlier this month.


Theo Acheampong, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the 18 months Ghana's took ""has actually been much faster"" than Zambia's and should help it get back on its feet.


The Paris Club of creditor nations, which usually coordinates communications for official creditors, did not respond to a request for comment.


But the government said the official creditor committee - which is co-chaired by France and China - saw the agreement as a good basis for consultation on its principle of ""Comparability of Treatment"" - analysis designed to ensure bondholders aren't given overly favourable terms.




Those bondholders now have two options.


One is a so-called disco bond offering an interest rate of 5% climbing to 6% after mid-2028 and with maturities across three instruments ranging between 2026-2029. It entails a haircut - or write down of 'principle' - of 37%.


The second is a par bond option capped at $1.6 billion with three instruments, of which the main one will pay a coupon of 1.5% and mature in 2037 with no haircut apart from a write-down of past due interest.


A separate bond partially guaranteed by the World Bank will see the multilateral lender fully pay the guaranteed portion to holders, the government said, while the unprotected part would be treated the same as the rest of the country's bonds.




IMF FUNDS


The deal means the IMF board is expected to sign off on the next $360 million tranche of Ghana's $3 billion support programme when it meets on June 28.


The West African gold and cocoa producer defaulted on most of its $30 billion in external debt in 2022, after the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and higher global interest rates exacerbated years of overstretched borrowing.


Ghana started formal talks with its two groups of bondholders in mid-March - one a group of international asset managers and hedge funds and another one including regional African banks.


It is resetting its debt under the G20 Common Framework, which has already seen Zambia and also Chad reach agreements. Ethiopia is expected to be next, but the setup has been widely criticised for being slow and cumbersome.




Ghana's bonds slipped following Monday's confirmation of the agreement but have risen more than 15% since expectations of a deal begin to build in March.

"If you do the maths very well, Finance Ministers figures dont tally  Williams Peprah","Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Williams Kwasi Peprah, says the $2 billion savings the Finance Minister claimed the country would achieve through successful negotiations with creditors is not entirely accurate.


Dr Mohammed Amin Adam announced the completion of Ghana’s debt restructuring programme with its official creditors. 


According to the Member of Parliament for Karaga, the government has successfully restructured its debt of $5.1 billion with these creditors, in addition to concluding the restructuring of $13.1 billion with Eurobond holders.


Addressing attendees at a UK Town Hall meeting, Dr Amin Adam highlighted that these efforts have resulted in savings of $8 billion for the country.





""Last two weeks, we concluded negotiations with the official creditors, and we have agreed to restructure 5.1 billion dollars. I am telling you that the government is good in negotiations and of this amount, we are going to make savings of $2 billion.""




""As I speak to you, tomorrow morning, there will be an announcement that we have also concluded our negotiations with the Eurobond Holders of $13.1 billion, and ladies and gentlemen, when we announce it, please read the details. We have negotiated a good deal for Ghana and that is $8 billion,"" he said.


However, Dr Adam said the minister’s comments might have been politically motivated. Speaking on JoyFM’s Top Story, he explained that the figures the minister mentioned do not reflect the agreement.


“I am sure he was on a political platform maybe he did not check his figures very well. You know last week they announced that the bilateral creditors have given us debt deferment. Meaning that we will pay fully the $5.1billion. So, I don’t know why he mentioned the savings of $2 billion.

“And then also, he mentioned that there was a savings of $8 billion, I am sure maybe as I have mentioned, he did not check his calculation very well,” he said on June 24.




The Associate Professor said that, after a 37% haircut, the amount left for Ghana to pay on the Eurobond debt is $8.25 billion.


Hence, the savings made can only be determined after the final document is sent to Parliament to review the debt restructuring in the mid-year budget.


He emphasised that “if you really do the Maths very well, the figures do not tally based on what he said on the platform.""


Additionally, he said the country is likely to see some stability in the Ghana cedi by the close of the year, but it is not the case that the cedi would appreciate against the dollar.

“Financial system doesn’t like noise, It doesn’t like uncertainty and so for me clears the way for   many things to happen. More inflows may come in. It also clear the way for people to invest properly and also it will certainly have some positive effect on the exchange rate and by extension inflation,” he said.




Speaking on Joy FM’s Top Story on June 24, Professor Quartey said it was good news and advised the government to ensure they do not overspend.


“In as much as it is good news for Ghana, we also have to be responsible going forward,” he added.

Explainer: Is SSNIT financially stable?,"Since 2018, Ghana's Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) has been on a mission to divest a 60% stake in six hotels within its portfolio - Labadi Beach Resort, Elmina Beach Resort, La Palm Royal Beach Resort, Ridge Royal Hotel, Busua Beach Resort, and the Trust Lodge Hotel.


The fund aims to transform these properties into world-class hotels by partnering with strategic investors to inject capital and manage operations, thereby enhancing profitability. Among the contenders, Bryan Acheampong, the current Minister for Food and Agriculture and owner of Rock City Hotel, has reportedly submitted the strongest technical and financial proposal. SSNIT is now in the final stages of negotiating the sale of a 60% stake in four of these hotels to Rock City.


This development comes on the heels of a recent report by the International Labour Organization (ILO), which cast doubt on the sustainability of Ghana’s pension scheme. The report has sparked public concern, prompting SSNIT to issue a statement and host a press conference to reassure citizens of the scheme's security and prudent management of their contributions.


However, a closer examination of SSNIT's financial performance, based on audited financial statements from 2014 to 2021, paints a more troubling picture. Despite SSNIT’s assurances, the data reveals stagnating investment returns, a narrowing gap between contributions and benefits, and a worrying trend of deficits in four of the nine years under review.


The disparity between contributions and benefits within SSNIT is alarming. From 2010 to 2021, SSNIT’s contributions increased 7 times (a 615% increase), but benefits paid out surged 11 times (a 1,067% increase). In 2021, SSNIT received GHS 4.1 billion in contributions and paid out GHS 3.6 billion in benefits. This narrowing gap suggests a potential scenario where benefits could outpace contributions, leaving SSNIT with no surplus for prudent investments and jeopardising its long-term financial stability.







Adding to its challenges, SSNIT faces significant public indebtedness. In 2021, the scheme was owed GHS 9 billion, up from GHS 4.57 billion in 2020, with public establishments accounting for 96% of this debt. Although SSNIT's Chief Actuary highlighted the government's compliance with current payments, legacy debts remain an unresolved issue.








Investment returns, a critical component for covering benefits and other expenses, have shown stagnation. SSNIT's net investment income averaged around GHS 400 million from 2013 to 2021, with intermittent reductions. The ILO report highlighted that ""Over the last 12 years, according to the financial statements, the average return on the total assets has been 12.2 per cent. If the effect of inflation is removed, this results in a real average return on assets of 0.9 per cent.""


This stagnation, coupled with the rapidly increasing benefits compared to contributions, threatens SSNIT's ability to meet its obligations. Robust investment income is essential for the sustainability of any pension scheme, raising questions about SSNIT's investment portfolio and potential losses. Without detailed information on SSNIT's investment expenditures and returns, speculation persists, but the available data suggests a troubling pattern that must be addressed.










SSNIT undergoes an external actuarial evaluation every three years, with findings incorporated into its financial statements. Since 2014, these evaluations have consistently indicated a lack of sustainability, with the only optimistic assessment in 2011 predicting unsustainability by 2031. 


While the 2022 and 2023 financial statements are not yet available, the existing data points to a precarious situation. Organized labour, despite having representation on SSNIT's board, appears to have been caught off guard by the external actuarial report, highlighting the need for increased vigilance and prudent measures.





The apparent lack of oversight underscores the urgency for stakeholders to actively monitor SSNIT's operations to safeguard the interests of contributors and ensure the fund's long-term viability. The challenges facing SSNIT are significant, and addressing them requires transparency, strategic investments, and rigorous financial management.

Sale of SSNIT hotels: Here are the 7 pre-qualification criteria outlined for prospective buyers,"A JoyNews research has revealed that the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) outlined seven pre-qualification criteria for all prospective buyers of a 60% stake in six hotels belonging to the Trust.


In an advertisement document sighted by JoyNews, SSNIT said its objective ”is to develop its owned hotels into world class standard in their respective categories and is therefore seeking capital injection from competent strategic investors with expertise in owning and managing hotels and/or development of real estate to finance these developments.”

“A total of nine (9) companies responded to the advertisements by submitting proposals on the 23rd March, 2022 deadline. Six (6) out of the nine (9) were then shortlisted and issued with Request for Proposal (RFP) documents,” the Trust stated in a statement released on 19th May, 2024.


In an advertisement document published by SSNIT in 2022 with project number: GR/SSNIT/CS/0001/2022, the Trust stated that interested firms should include the following information in their expression of interest:





Legal status of firm (evidence of registration/incorporation);

Relevant credentials in hotel industry;


CV of key personnel;

MPs laud Lands Minister for ratifying Ghana Bauxite Companys mining lease,"Parliament has unanimously ratified the Mining Lease granted by the government to the Ghana Bauxite Company to mine bauxite at Awaso in the Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai Municipality of the Western North Region. 


This was after a joint Parliamentary Committee of Mines and Energy and Lands and Forestry presented its report to the House on Wednesday, June 26, 2024.


The Awaso bauxite mine forms an integral part of government’s policy to build an integrated aluminium industry in Ghana.


The Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC), which was established to promote and develop an integrated aluminium industry in the country, has identified this mine as one of its four projects to build an integrated industry.


As part of its strategy, GIADEC is working with strategic investors to expand the mine and build a refinery solution to refine bauxite mined in the area.




Currently, the Ghana Bauxite Company, which has been in existence for over 80 years, is the only bauxite-producing company in Ghana.


The company has gone through different phases since it started operation in the 1940s.


Originally owned by the British Aluminium Company Ltd, the government acquired a 55% stake in the company in 1972, under the Mining Operations (Government Participation) Decree, 1972 (NRCD 132), passed pursuant to the National Redemption Council’s policy of “taking over the commanding heights of the economy.”


However, the company faced several challenges after this, with production decreasing from four hundred and seven thousand tonnes (407,000t) in 1974 to a paltry sixty-four thousand tonnes (64,000t) in 1982.




Government, therefore, decided to divest its interest in the company, and in 1997, Alcan, a Canadian company, acquired an 80% stake in the company, with government holding the remaining 20%. 


Rio Tinto, a British-Australian multinational, acquired Alcan’s interest in the company, before selling same to the Bosai Minerals Group in 2010.


In 2022, however, Ofori-Poku Company Limited (OPCL), a wholly owned Ghanaian company acquired the eighty-percent stake held by Bosai, making the company, for the first time in its eighty-year history, a wholly owned Ghanaian company.


OPCL was incorporated in 1990 and has enormous experience in the mining industry, having operated as a leading supplier of various mine services, including haulage, transport and provision of climate change solutions.




Following the expiration of its mining lease, the Company was granted a new lease on May 3, 2024, covering the Kanayerebo, Subri, Nchiniso, Afumba and Bokahirri Hills in Awaso. 


Earlier, this month, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Samuel A. Jinapor, laid the mining lease in Parliament for ratification, in accordance with article 268(1) of the 1992 Constitution, and the Speaker referred it to the Joint Committee of Mines and Energy and Lands and Forestry. 


Presenting the report of the Joint Committee to Parliament, the Chairman of the Mines and Energy Committee, Samuel Atta Akyea, said the request by the Minister for the mining lease to be ratified is in accord with the constitutional provision which ensures parliamentary oversight over the management and utilisation of the natural resources of the country. 


He said the mining lease was consistent with the Constitution and relevant laws of the country, and ratifying it will bring tremendous benefits to government and promote the socio-economic development of the area.




He said the Committee was, also, satisfied that the company has the financial and technical capacities to execute its obligations under the Lease, and, therefore, recommends the lease for ratification.


Members of the House praised the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources for bringing the lease to the House for ratification. 


They noted that the constitutional provision which requires Parliamentary ratification of mining leases has been violated by successive Governments since 1992. 


Members also congratulated the Minister and Government for securing a Ghanaian investor to invest in this strategic Mine, which makes the Mine wholly owned by Ghanaians. 




Members, again, lauded government for incorporating plans to build a refinery into the agreement to ensure value addition to the minerals mined.


They expressed optimism that these measures will inure to the benefit of Ghanaians.


On his part, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Hon. Samuel A. Jinapor, thanked the House and the members of the joint Committee for their diligence and for unanimously supporting the motion for the ratification of the mining lease. 


He said government was fully committed to indigenising the mining industry and is working with all stakeholders to ensure that Ghanaians participate fully across the full value chain of the mining industry.  




The ratification of the mining lease grants the company full rights to operate the mine, secure the employment of the hundreds of people who depend on the mine and contribute to the socio-economic development of the community and the country at large.

BCM Ghana denies allegations of victimisation of previous employees,"A prominent mining solutions company, BCM Ghana Limited, has denied allegations of unfair treatment and victimisation of its employees.


In an official statement, BCM Ghana described the allegations as “unfounded and purposely meant to tarnish the image of its leadership and the company.”


The company emphasised its adherence to employment contracts and local labour laws, stating that all employee departures are managed strictly with these guidelines.


Regarding the claims of sexual harassment and unjust treatment of former employees, the company noted that no formal complaints were lodged by the alleged victims during their tenure.


However, BCM  Ghana has vowed to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter.




Among the allegations are issues concerning Simon Terbobri, a former employee who was reportedly intoxicated at work.


The company asserted that the issues surrounding Terbobri have been misrepresented, particularly given that his lawyers have been in active settlement discussions with BCM as recently as June 20, 2024.


This timing, according to the company, casts doubt on the credibility of the claims and suggests a deliberate attempt to damage BCM’s reputation at a critical time of business refocus and growth.


In another case, a former employee, Jonathan Adongo is accused of refusing to return a company laptop and assaulting a BCM staff member during the recovery process. This incident is currently being adjudicated in court.




BCM highlighted that Adongo’s actions were motivated by an attempt to conceal information from the company.


The company has instructed its legal team to take action against those responsible for what it terms “deliberate intent to damage the image and reputation of BCM Ghana Limited.”


BCM further reaffirmed its mission to deliver exceptional mining solutions and drive economic growth in the region, underscoring its commitment to safety, environmental responsibility, and community empowerment.


In a sector marked by intense scrutiny and competition, BCM Ghana’s response underscores its resolve to defend its standing as a reputable and socially responsible employer.

Power takes between 15% and 40% of our operational costs  AngloGold Energy Advisor,"Principal Electrical and Energy Advisor, AngloGold Ashanti Africa Business Unit (ABU), Kisman Eghan, has described as worrying the cost of power to mining firms, saying, it constitutes between 15% and 40% of operational cost of a mine.


According to him, a typical 200,000 ounces of mine will pay between $20 million to $40 million per annum on energy.


“That is huge! And also due to the complexities of the sort of equipment that we use”, he disclosed at a recent panel discussion at the 17th West Africa Mining and Power Expo.


Availability and reliability of power


Mr. Eghan also expressed worry about the availability and reliability of power, saying, “In our world, for instance, the availability of power, where we sit in the central portion of town, until recently that the KWTV was operationalised we used to have a series of interruptions which is affecting a lot of mines there"".




“So, generation…even the location of the generation itself. Most of Ghana - we have all the generation - located in the southern sector, which does not help most of the mines in the central and northern portion of the country”, he stated.


“So that is one. And then the reliability side, which as far as we are concerned, the transmission lines.


“There has been a programme about two, three years ago, where I'm involved. I think we contributed close to 850,000 to help. And this is all in an attempt to improve the reliability of power to our mines”, he added.


Intermittent power supply




Mr. Eghan was worried  again about the intermittent power supply in mining areas and the availability of power, saying, one hour loss of power is equivalent to about 45 ounces for a typical 400,000 ounces production mine.


He said it takes most of the processing plants between two to three hours to return to normalcy and therefore one-hour loss of power is equivalent to about 45 ounces.


“It's a lot, it's about $110,000. So, if I have one interruption and it takes me three hours to come back, that three hours is equivalent to about $350,000. Now imagine I'm in the central portion and I have seven or 10 of such interruptions in a day. We are talking about $350,000 multiplied by 10, $3.5 million dollars. So, you see where we're coming from”, he mentioned.


“It's a lot of burden on us. That's why we are ready to even assist the utilities. Is there anything we can do to help you so that the reliability level will be okay for us? So that cost availability, reliability will be better”, he added.




Mining firms partnership with utilities


Due to the rising cost of power, the mining firms have called for partnerships with the utility firms.


For instance, Mr. Eghan said his outfit is constructing 100 megawatts solar to the tune of $125 million.


However, it cannot bear the cost alone and need support of the utility firms.




“I cannot bear that cost alone. Yet I need to reduce my emission from a certain level where I am to a certain level by 2030 and 2050. So, all these things are coming to play here because we know when the renewables come in the cost would even go down”.


“We were happy when the Energy Sector Recovery Programme came in because we knew the bottom line is that the huge debt will be solved. Reliability will be taken care of and then the costs will also be tackled”, he noted.


He concluded that “We are all waiting for that to happen so that we can also mine more”.

Dept Housing Minister highlights key role of urbanisation and smart cities in sustainable development,"The Deputy Minister for Works and Housing, Dr Prince Hamid Armah has underscored the pivotal role of urbanisation and smart cities in driving Ghana's sustainable development. 


Addressing the audience at the Accra International Conference Centre on Wednesday, June 26, he highlighted the government's renewed commitment to inclusive and sustainable industrialisation.


Opening with greetings from the Minister of Works and Housing, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, he delved into the transformative potential of urbanisation, noting that approximately 58% of Ghana's population now resides in urban areas, with an urbanisation rate of 3.4% per year. 





While this trend presents opportunities for economic growth, it also poses significant challenges that require innovative solutions.


Dr. Armah passionately advocated for the development of smart cities as a key strategy to address these challenges. 




He explained that smart cities leverage technology, data, and innovation to enhance residents' quality of life, improve service efficiency, and promote sustainability. 


He highlighted the government's efforts in this direction, including the Digital Ghana Agenda, which aims to integrate technology into urban life, and the National Broadband Infrastructure Project, designed to provide high-speed internet access nationwide.


Sustainability, Dr Armah emphasised, is central to the smart city concept. 


He outlined various government initiatives aimed at promoting renewable energy, efficient waste management, and green building practices. 







Notably, the Ghana Renewable Energy Master Plan aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix, while the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan seeks to enhance public transportation and reduce traffic congestion.


Technological innovation was another key theme in Dr. Armah's address. 


He stressed the importance of fostering a culture of innovation and supporting tech startups, citing the establishment of the Ghana Innovation Hub as a critical step in nurturing technological entrepreneurship. 


This initiative, along with policies on digital literacy and STEM education, aims to build a workforce capable of sustaining Ghana's smart city ambitions.




Inclusivity was a recurring theme throughout Dr. Armah's speech. 


He emphasised that a truly smart city ensures that the benefits of urbanisation and technological advancements are accessible to all citizens, regardless of socio-economic status. 


The government's Affordable Housing Programme and the introduction of digital financial services were highlighted as key initiatives promoting inclusivity and financial inclusion.





In his concluding remarks, Dr Armah called for a collaborative effort between the government and the private sector to realise the vision of smart cities in Ghana. 




He underscored the importance of public-private partnerships in driving the smart city agenda and achieving sustainable development goals.


""Urbanisation and the development of smart cities present us with a unique opportunity to transform our urban landscapes and improve the quality of life for all Ghanaians,"" Dr Armah stated. 


""Together, we can build cities that are not only smart but also vibrant, sustainable, and inclusive, driving our nation towards a prosperous and equitable future.""


Dr Armah's address at the Ghana Industrialisation Week has set a visionary path for Ghana's urban and industrial future, inspiring all stakeholders to contribute towards a brighter tomorrow.




The 24th edition of the Ghana Industrialisation Week was under the theme: “Renaissance of Ghana’s Industrialisation; The Renewed Commitment Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Development, Produce, Add Value and Economic Diversification.”

A glimpse into Ghanas future housing solutions,"On June 8, Appolonia City hosted its much-anticipated Open Day, drawing over 100 participants from diverse backgrounds to experience firsthand how the city is addressing Ghana's housing deficit. 


This event offered a comprehensive tour of Appolonia City's sprawling 2,325-acre mixed-use development, showcasing the ambitious project that has been in progress since 2012.


The Open Day was an eye-opening experience for attendees, who included potential homeowners, investors, industry professionals, and community leaders. 


They were treated to an extensive tour of the development, which is set to accommodate 20,000 housing units and a population of 100,000 residents upon completion. 


This initiative is poised to make a significant impact on Ghana's housing sector, providing modern, affordable living spaces and fostering community growth.




Participants walked through various sections of Appolonia City, observing the ongoing construction and the thoughtful planning behind the development to appreciate the city’s live-work-play concept.

The exhibition showcased the transformation of the land from what was essentially a mini-forest into the thriving urban space it is today, emphasizing the project's commitment to sustainable development and community engagement.




Appolonia City is not just a real estate project but a strategic solution to Ghana's pressing housing needs. 


The development aims to alleviate the housing shortage by offering a range of housing options that cater to various income levels. 


By doing so, Appolonia City is making homeownership accessible to more Ghanaians, thereby contributing to social stability and economic growth.


The success of Appolonia City can be attributed to the collaboration between various stakeholders, including local authorities, private investors, and the Appolonia Community.




As Appolonia City continues to grow, it remains committed to reducing Ghana's housing deficit and creating a model urban development.

Saglemi Housing Project bids to be received on July 8,"The Ministry of Works and Housing is poised to receive bids from private sector entities eager to take on the redevelopment of the long-stalled Saglemi Housing Project.


This crucial step comes as the deadline for the submission of proposals approaches, signalling a new chapter in the effort to complete this significant housing initiative.


With 10 potential developers expressing interest after thorough site explorations, the Ministry is looking forward to the formal submission of bids by these entities.


Addressing journalists in Accra on Wednesday, June 19, 2024, Minister for Works and Housing, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, provided an update on the Request for Proposals (RFP) issued earlier this year.





""A couple of months ago we issued a Request for Proposals (RFP). To date, I’ve been briefed that about 10 companies, international and local, have expressed interest, have picked up forms, have been taken to the project site, and have had the opportunity to inspect work that has been left there so far,"" the Minister announced.




The Saglemi Housing Project initially envisioned to deliver 5,000 affordable housing units, was scaled back to 1,506 units before being halted due to legal issues. 


The partially built structures have since been subject to vandalism and theft, further complicating efforts to complete the project. 


However, the current administration is determined to see it through by leveraging private sector expertise and resources.


Minister Oppong Nkrumah emphasized the government's commitment to transparency and fairness in the selection process. 







""According to the work plan that we’ve put together, by the 8th or on the 8th of July, we expect to formally receive all of the bids. 


""We will do it openly and we will hand over the bids to an independent evaluation entity for an evaluation report and based on that, government will proceed to select one of the bidders,"" he stated.


This approach he explained aims to ensure that the best-suited developer is chosen based on merit and quality, addressing the long-standing issue of incomplete public housing projects in Ghana.


The coming weeks will be crucial as the Ministry receives and hands over the bids for evaluation. 




The chosen developer will breathe life back into the Saglemi project, finally delivering much-needed housing for Ghanaians.

Bond market: market turnover expands to GH546.49m,"The Ghanaian secondary bond market sustained the uptrend in activity last week.


This reflected in a notable increase of nearly six times in total face value traded to GH¢546.49 million. 


The increase in activity was largely supported by block trades in the February 2027 bond (Average Yield To Maturity:  25.61%), which accounted for nearly half of the aggregate market turnover. 


The front of the LCY yield curve continues to drive market activity, contributing 70% of the week’s market turnover, while the belly and the tail jointly accounted for 30%. 


Analysts expect exchange volumes on the bond market to improve following end-of-month dynamics, which typically see most banks seeking liquidity through Repo trades.

Bond market: Total turnover expands to GH93.86m,"The Ghanaian secondary bond market experienced a notable increase in total face value traded to GH¢93.86 million.


This is a five times improvement over the preceding week.


The increase in activity was partly supported by block volumes in the February 2030 bond (Average Yield To Maturity: 23.46%), which accounted for a third of the aggregate market turnover.


Overall, the front of the LCY [Lower Curve] yield curve contributed 54% of the week’s market turnover.


On the other hand, the belly and the tail accounted for 26% and 20%, respectively.




Analysts expect exchange volumes on the bond market to improve but still below the GH¢100 million mark.

Bond market: Turnover tumbled by 88.05%to GH18.51m,"The total volume exchanged on the secondary bond market for Government of Ghana papers lost steam last week.


The market turnover declined sharply by 88.05% week-on-week to GH¢18.51 million.


Notably, the decline in market activity was largely driven by a 95% week-on-week decrease in exchange activity across the front and tail of the LCY yield curve.


However, market activity bounced back at the belly of the curve.


This constituted 27%% of the weekly aggregate market turnover.




Analysts expect exchange volumes to remain sluggish in the bond market as the treasury bills continue to drive secondary market activity.

4G to remain primary source of mobile phone connectivity by 2033 despite emergence of 5G  Fitch Solutions,"4G platforms will remain the primary source of connectivity in Ghana by 2033, owing to greater smartphone affordability.


This is despite the emergence of the 5G platforms.


According to Fitch Solutions, only 21.2% of connections will be 5G by 2033, with 4G expected to remain dominant due to handset costs, as 4G handsets are currently the most commercially accessible to consumers.


The establishment of a wholesale 5G national network in Ghana is aimed at negating the risk of over-investment through asset duplication, which would likely have resulted from the traditional approach of allocating licences to multiple operators.


The Minister of Communications and Digitalisation, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, has confirmed plans to build a wholesale 5G national network, rather than allocating individual 5G concessions to existing or new operators.




The new open access network will be constructed by a consortium of local entities and two players from India, alongside Nokia and Microsoft. The project aims to enhance digital inclusion through the provision of low-cost network infrastructure services in the sectors of education, healthcare, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and payment services.


However, Fitch Solutions said the wholesale open access network model has met with little success in other markets, most notably in Mexico where the state-owned Altan Redes 5G network has consistently operated at a loss and is technically bankrupt.


“We are also watching similar developments in Malaysia, where the Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) project has fallen behind schedule. Established in March 2021, the project is being led by a special-purpose vehicle company owned by the government, which is collaborating with six mobile operators and service providers that have proved reluctant to participate. A change in government, issues with the vendor selection process and a decision to establish a second wholesale 5G network have further clouded the long-term sustainability outlook for the project”, it pointed out.


In Ghana, Telecel Ghana and AT Ghana are both participating in the project as the Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC), which has been granted a licence to deploy and operate the shared 5G infrastructure.




India-based Radisys (owned by market disruptor Reliance Jio) and Tech Mahindra are involved in the project. Additionally, Ghana-based Ascend Digital and K-Nat are also part of the consortium. The combined entities are reportedly planning to invest $145 million in capital expenditures over the next three years.


Fitch Solutions said there is limited information available on the vendor selection process from the government, adding, MTN's involvement has not been clearly outlined.


“It appears most likely that MTN will be required to use the shared infrastructure once there is no spectrum available for individual allocation”, it stressed.


MTN remains the dominant market player in Ghana with 74.5% of the mobile market share at the end of March 2024.

Building Ghanas financial resilience through FinTech,"The rise in the cost of living and global economic instability over the past few years has caused significant financial strain for many individuals and businesses. 


In Ghana, the fluctuating currency value and increasing inflation are driving up the cost of goods and services faster than wages can keep up.


The pressing question is: how can individuals and businesses build resilience to withstand these economic shocks and maintain financial stability?


Addressing students and industry stakeholders at the University of Ghana Business School’s 44th Management Week celebration, Telecel Ghana's Director of Mobile Financial Services and Digital Transformation, Philip Amoateng, shared insights on how financial technology (FinTech) can bolster financial resilience for individuals and households amid the current economic climate.


Defining financial resilience as the ability to manage unexpected expenses while maintaining financial stability, Mr Amoateng identified key challenges facing Ghana’s financial sector. 




These include the large informal sector, limited access to traditional banking services, the banking sector crisis, the aftermath of the domestic debt exchange program, and overall economic volatility.


FinTech has provided a gateway for unbanked individuals to access formal financial services. Mobile money services have increased the convenience of transactions and improved access to savings and loan products, helping users achieve their financial goals.


Between 2020 and 2021, Ghana saw a remarkable 58.5% growth in mobile money and digital financial services, highlighting FinTech’s role in bridging the financial services gap. 


Mr Amoateng credited this growth to the Bank of Ghana's proactive policies promoting financial inclusion.




""By integrating advanced technology with financial services, FinTech has democratised access to financial transactions, monetary advice, and risk management strategies,"" said Mr. Amoateng. 


""It continues to help consumers navigate turbulent times with greater resilience, a privilege once reserved for the affluent and privileged few.""


Mr Amoateng elaborated on specific ways FinTech enhances financial resilience. Mobile money services like Telecel Cash facilitate easy savings and payments, reducing reliance on cash and lowering transaction costs. 





Digital banking platforms broaden access to savings accounts, financial literacy apps, and loan guidance.




""FinTech is fostering a culture of saving through automated savings apps and provides access to low-cost investment options like mutual funds and government bonds,"" he added. 


""Microloans offered via mobile platforms provide vital lifelines for emergencies and business needs, while peer-to-peer lending platforms offer community-based support.""


Another promising area for FinTech is insurance. Microinsurance products offer affordable health, life, and property coverage, while InsurTech innovations streamline the purchasing and claiming of policies.


Mr Amoateng presented a compelling case study of Telecel Cash, revealing that the platform processes over GH¢3 billion in monthly transactions for individuals and businesses, covering everything from service payments to remittances. 




In 2023 alone, Telecel Cash paid over GH¢30 million in interest income to approximately 2.6 million registered customers and facilitated over GH¢500 million in direct international money transfers.


“These benefits significantly enhance the financial resilience of individuals and households. This is the kind of resilience a digital finance overlay on technology can bring to individuals and households in Ghana,” Amoateng said.


Looking ahead, Amoateng emphasised the need to expand rural access to FinTech services for equitable distribution, integrate the technology within sectors like agriculture and healthcare, and leverage these tools for personal financial well-being.


He concluded with a call for addressing the challenges facing FinTech, including cybersecurity threats, social engineering schemes, overburdening taxes, and infrastructure vandalism, which collectively stifle the sector's growth.

Video: All you need to know about NextGen Infraco 5G deal- Bright Simons explains,"Did you know that NextGen Infraco has an exclusive license to offer 5G services for the next ten years in Ghana?


According to the Honorary Vice President of IMANI-Africa, Bright Simons, the contract offered to NextGen Infraco gives them the sole right to offer 5G services to consumers.


This, he explains, would give some monopoly to NextGen Infraco in the telecommunication industry.


Speaking on JoyNews' Newsfile, he explained that in 2021, MTN had applied for a license to run 5G services, yet the company was denied access.


As such, he said  “We are working very carefully and diabolically to construct a new monopoly that controls multiple telecom access, that for us is very dangerous.”




Bright Simons added that that this would also fragment the sector further than it already is.


Again, he said shares of the NextGen infraco are owned by some companies involved in a murky deal.

"Enhanced incentive and regulatory frameworks needed in Ghanas oil palm sector, study reveals","A recent Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) and Proforest study has underscored the critical need for improved incentive and regulatory frameworks to unlock value chain opportunities in Ghana’s oil palm sector.


The research highlights the potential for creating jobs, protecting the environment, and enhancing rural development through prioritised research, land access, RSPO certification, and sustainable practices.


The study engaged oil palm producers in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western, and Central regions, providing several key insights.


Out-grower schemes, which connect smallholder farmers with buyers in value chains, offer mutual benefits by granting smallholders market access, inputs, and technical support through contract farming.


The oil palm processing industry also yields products such as crude palm oil, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel cake, with crude palm oil dominating production. Additionally, the study found that oil palm waste can be converted into valuable products like organic fertiliser, fibres, and boiler fuel for steam and electricity in large-scale mills.




The research, which includes case studies from Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire, aims to attract investment in sustainable oil palm development by engaging governments, development partners, investors, and private sector companies.





It identifies several key areas for investment. Government ministries, such as those of Food and Agriculture, Trade and Industry, and Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation, play crucial roles in creating an enabling environment to attract financial investors, NGOs, and donor partners.


Private sector agencies, including the Association of Ghana Industries and the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are pivotal in boosting investment attraction.


The government offers incentives such as free seedlings, free zone waivers (covering import tariffs, VAT, and tax holidays), and subsidies for inputs to promote oil palm development.




Moreover, investment opportunities exist in primary production, processing, and converting oil palm trunks (OPT) and fronds (OPF) into valuable products.


Public sector support programs like Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) are available, though there are limitations in the technical capacity for policy implementation.


However, the study also highlights several challenges. Land tenure conflicts are a significant barrier to investment, and smallholder out-growers often struggle with financial literacy and access to funds. Regulatory compliance issues, such as current non-compliance with import regulations, present bottlenecks. Additionally, currency depreciation and price fluctuations pose risks for the sector.


To address these challenges, the study offers several key recommendations, including strengthening the incentive framework and improving law enforcement to mitigate investment risks.




It also recommends enhancement of regulatory frameworks and encouraging circular economy investments to boost employment opportunities and wealth creation as well as promoting smallholder inclusion in value chains, particularly through, out-grower schemes, to resource-poor farmers.

PARM equips farmers with knowledge in agricultural risk management,"The Platform for Agricultural Risk Management (PARM) has trained private sector actors in the agriculture sector on integrating Agricultural Risk Management (ARM) into policies and institutional capacities, as well as in developing investment plans to better manage agricultural risks.


The workshop, in collaboration with the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), aimed to train actors and facilitate knowledge exchange among sector players to ensure that all individuals within the value chain are more resilient in risk management.





Speaking to JoyNews on June 27, Capacity Development Specialist, Francesca Nugnes said the three-day event aimed at building the capacity of participants on risk management holistic approach, risk assessment and prioritisation by value chain


“Foreign companies that are coming in from Italy are not only to do their own business but really to develop a thriving system, exchanging knowledge. This is important because we need to learn from the Ghana actors and we can exchange experience and together, we can keep all the actors of the value chain to be more resilient to…. and also all type of unforeseen events,” she said.


Capacity Development Specialist, Francesca Nugnes


Additionally, she said the training will equip private sector actors to manage their resources and properly plan their investments and offer evidence-based, risk tools and strategies for monitoring and evaluation.







“The private sector enterprise to plan the allocation of their resources and the risk and investment done on their activities. The objective is to have a better view of agriculture risk and been aware of the risk, knowing how to manage it and the risk investments,” she added.


A participant, Georgina Koomson, said the programme has helped her identify new ways to manage the risks she faces while farming in a fire-prone community.





“With this programme it is helping us to also to understand and diversify in our operations,” she said.


Meanwhile, she mentioned that the knowledge gained from the programme has broadened her understanding of why it is important to analyse the type of crop before making investments, which subsequently reduces risk.




Another participant, Dr Felix Kamassah, praised the initiative, stating that it would benefit the shaping of agricultural policy.





He urged the government to take an interest in agricultural risk assessment to guide policies, including the Planting for Food and Jobs initiative, ensuring value for money.

"Health risks mount for Ghanaian women in palm oil production as they call for cleaner cooking technologies, better healthcare access","OFORIKROM, Ashanti Region - Women working in small-scale palm oil production face severe health risks from hazardous conditions involving high heat and constant exposure to toxic smoke, according to experts.


Thousands of women and being sickened and risking death from illnesses resulting from their work. Workers and health experts are now calling on the industry to clean up its act with cleaner cooking technologies and better healthcare access.


On a sunny afternoon here in Oforikrom, a community in the Ashanti Region of Ghana, 42-year-old Vivian Fori stands beside an open firewood stand stirring a big pot of deep red palm oil. A thick smoke fills the air.


Vivian Fori stirring a big pot of palm oil


Using her hand to wipe her teary eyes and sweating face, Vivian says she uses firewood to cook the whole day. She processes palm oil on a small scale, a job taught to her by her mother-in-law three years ago. It’s been a reliable source of income for her family.


""This work is full of stress but it is worth it,” Vivian says. “It is a job for females. You can make a lot of profit from processing palm oil, but it is not so much. At least you can get a wage that can take you through the day.”




Using high heat to heat, grind and pound the palm kernel to get the oil is physically draining but she has little choice.


""The work is exhausting. But I use two days to rest to regain my strength,” Vivian says. “Every job is stressful. How will you get money, if you are not willing to suffer for it?”


Health Impacts on Women:


Vivian uses the traditional cookstove known in local parlance as ""bukyia"". It’s made from clay and built in 3 stands to support large saucepans during cooking. To fuel the stove, Vivian uses bundles of firewood.




The traditional cookstove commonly known as 'bukyia""


“When cooking, the place becomes full of smoke,” she says. “The smoke gets into my eyes. At night, I find it hard to sleep. My eyes are red and it aches. It is as if something is pinching my eyes. But that will not make me stop this work.”


At Bomso community, in Ashanti, another small-scale palm oil producer named Charity Kpogo, finds she is unable to open her eyes for days.

""At times, it is difficult to keep my eyes open,” Charity says. “When I open my eyes, the smoke and sweat gets into it. So I rush to get cold water to wash my face before I continue working. I worry about this so much.” 


Vivian and Charity are some of the thousands of women whose health is threatened by the harmful effects of cooking with firewood. According to the World Health Organization nearly four million people each year die from household smoke produced by dirty stoves and fuels.







According to Dr Florence Boa-Amponsem, Medical Coordinator for Doctors in Business Organization the smoke will cause a range of illnesses.


“So the women who are constantly sitting by it, it causes those problems they highlighted,” says Dr Boa Amponsem. “Sometimes it even goes as far as triggering asthma. We also have skin blemishes, breathing problems and blurred vision. It goes hand in hand with other kinds of exposures.”


Women are likely to suffer from particular problems from long-term exposure to smoke.


“When it comes to women, sometimes, it causes a hormonal balance, there is also low immunity,” she says. “The more you sit by these gasses exposed from the firewood. It causes a lot of dehydration. As you are exposed, your immunity gets suppressed.”




Dirty cooking practices are also contributing to climate change. Burning solid fuels produces carbon dioxide – the key gas leading to global warming.


Access to medical facilities


Despite her painful symptoms, the cost and lost income from work mean Vivian Fori rarely seeks medical care. She only visits the hospital when she is unable to stand.


""You know in Ghana, we all do not like going for check-ups,” Vivian says. “As long as I am able to stand on my two feet, I am okay. If I am down, that is when I seek medical care. After I inherited this job from my mother-in-law, I got sick and was admitted to the hospital for about three days. Since that incident, I have felt weak generally sometimes.”







Charity Kpogo has never visited the hospital but relies on a widely used but unproven blood tonic whenever she feels dizzy.


""We get so sick often coming into contact with this high heat and smoke,” Charity says. “If you do not drink blood tonic for a week or in a month, you will be seriously ill. I take blood tonics all the time. Whenever I feel dizzy, I run to the pharmacy shop to buy it. It helps me get the strength to continue working. You don't even have to go to the hospital.”


But Dr Obed Amponsah, a Kwame Nkrumah University pharmacist, says he has seen no evidence of blood tonics treating respiratory diseases or other smoke-related infections. 


""Once you are having these nutrients taken in exogenously or externally from these preparations, it could help your body generate energy. So, the women may feel energized for the next day's activities,” Dr Amponsah says. “There is also the placebo effect of taking medicine, where your mind - which is a powerful organ - makes you believe so long as you take the medicine you will get better.




Dr Amponsah reveals a study conducted in January 2024 at Chorkor Township in the Greater Accra Region showed women who were exposed to smoke were generally found to be anemic – meaning lacking in iron.





""Now if you are anemic and you are taking some of these tonics, definitely you are going to feel better. This is because you are replenishing your blood. It could also be dependent on the dose that you take,” he says.


Impact on surrounding communities


Gloria Keglo is a student nurse who lives around the neighborhood of Bomso, where Charity Kpogo's palm oil production site is located. Gloria assists the crew as an errand girl.

She has lived in the neighborhood for more than two decades and currently suffers from a persistent cough which she is currently treating at the KNUST hospital.


""The fire and the kind of wood used here brings out more smoke,” Gloria says. “Sometimes the place will be so smoky. The smoke takes over the whole place, such that we find it difficult to breathe. So you just have to move out of the place, when the smoke goes down then you come back.”


Balancing economic necessity with health risks.


Ghana’s economic troubles have caused prices of everything to rise. For women here the firewood that fuels their business has risen as much as five times in price. A tricycle filled with firewood that used to cost 25 to 20 cedis is now 150 cedis.

That has opened a window here where women are willing to consider different, cleaner energy sources.


“Even we could get another source of fuel without coming into contact with this high heat and smoke. I will like it very much,” says Charity.


Gloria is one of the few educated people in her neighborhood so the women here have asked her to help them in finding an organization to train them on safe production methods using cleaner energy.


""They say I am going forward in life and meeting people in high places, so they tell me to bring people to come and change or educate them on some safe ways of cooking without getting sick,” Gloria says. “They tell me they have been doing this unclean cooking for a long time, and they are looking for ways to make things easier.”


Introduction of cleaner cooking technologies and their effectiveness.


There is a lot of progress being made on solutions for dirty cooking. Here at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology researchers have been coming up with cleaning options for cooking in a range of impacted industries and in Ghanaian households.


Dr Micheal Commeh is in charge of sustainable industrial materials in climate change mitigation interventions across Ghana. He has built an improved cook stove that has been placed in a number for senior high schools and businesses producing food on a large scale.


Dr Micheal Commeh shows models of his clean cookstove


""The fundamental design is such that the tip of the flame is the one that will meet the cooking pot containing what you are cooking or smoking,” Dr Commeh says. “Because the tip of the flame is the cleanest and has less smoke or emissions. It is designed so that the tip gives you more heat and less smoke.”


The improved cook stove can be used for boiling, baking and frying.


A model of the newly improved cookstove


""There are high temperatures there, that is 850 to 1,200 degrees Celsius,” he says. “It cooks your food very well and faster. It reduces the energy source that is the use of charcoal and firewood between 60 to 80%. A little bit of firewood will cook your food fast and well.”


The cook stove uses less firewood, costing about 10 cedis, compared to more than 100 cedis for the traditional stove. The upfront cost is high but Dr Commeh says it will be repaid fast. The improved cook stove does not require much maintenance, the combustion chamber only has to be changed every two to three years.





""These huge stoves will take you four to six months to pay back,” he says. “Which means you are saving a lot of fuel and money. With the LPG, you are spending over 250 cedis cooking throughout the night, whereas you spend only 10 cedis with the newly improved cook stove. With the old cook stoves, you spend about 60 cedis. You save money in terms of going for firewood and paying hospital bills. The cost of the improved cook stove is between 3000 and 5000 dollars.”


Safety Measures


Experts say that broad government support for cleaning the air, and Ghana’s large number of clean energy entrepreneurs, mean the country is well placed to move fast to replace dirty cooking practices over the next few years. 


Women like Vivian Fori are pleading for it to come fast to save them from illnesses that are making life intolerable and taking some women’s lives.





Until women get access to cleaner cooking devices, experts advise them to protect themselves by avoiding smoke as much as possible, wearing nose masks and investing in clean alternatives like LPG gas when they can.

NTSB sanctions Boeing over release of 737 MAX investigation details,"U.S. investigators on Thursday sanctioned Boeing for revealing details of a probe into a 737 MAX mid-air blowout and said they would refer its conduct to the Justice Department, prompting the embattled planemaker to issue an apology.


The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing had ""blatantly violated"" its rules by providing ""non-public investigative information"" and speculating about possible causes of the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines (ALK.N), opens new tab door-plug emergency during a factory tour attended by dozens of journalists.


The decision sheds new light on strains between the crisis-hit planemaker and government agencies at a time when it is trying to avoid criminal charges being weighed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) ahead of a July 7 deadline.


""As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,"" the NTSB said.


The NTSB said Boeing would keep its status as a party to the investigation into the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines emergency but would no longer see information produced during its probe into the accident, which involved the mid-air blowout of a door plug with four missing bolts.




Unlike other parties, Boeing will now not be allowed to ask questions of other participants at a hearing on August 6-7.


""We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB’s role as the source of investigative information,"" Boeing said in a statement.


The NTSB's criticism revolves around comments made during a media briefing about quality improvements on Tuesday at the 737 factory near Seattle - widely seen as part of an exercise to showcase greater transparency ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.


During the briefing, which was held on Tuesday under an embargo allowing contents to be published on Thursday, an executive said the plug had been opened on the assembly line without the correct paperwork to fix a quality issue with surrounding rivets, and that missing bolts were not replaced.




The team that came in and closed the plug was not responsible for reinstalling the bolts, Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality, added.


The NTSB said that by providing investigative information and giving an analysis of information already released, Boeing had contravened its agreement with the agency.


""Boeing offered opinions and analysis on factors it suggested were causal to the accident,"" it added.


DOJ SCRUTINY


In May, the DOJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement with prosecutors that shielded it from criminal charges over interactions with the Federal Aviation Administration prior to MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.




U.S. prosecutors have recommended criminal charges be brought, Reuters reported on Sunday. The DOJ already has a separate criminal probe into the door-plug episode.


Thursday's rare exchange marks the latest sign of strains between Boeing and the NTSB.


In 2018, Boeing was widely criticised for issuing a statement appearing to question the performance of pilots in the first of two fatal crashes that led to a grounding of the MAX. Later investigations emphasised the role of flawed software.


In March this year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told a U.S. Senate hearing Boeing had failed to provide names of employees on its 737 MAX door team for two months, drawing criticism from lawmakers. Boeing then quickly provided the names.




On Thursday, the NTSB said Boeing had portrayed its investigation of the Alaska air incident to media as a search to locate the individual responsible for plug work.


""The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident, not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability,"" the agency said.


Asked during Tuesday's briefing who had failed to fill in documentation, Lund said: ""There may have been one or more than one employee. What I will say is the 'who' is absolutely in the responsibility of the NTSB. That investigation is still going on and I am going to not comment on that right now"".


The role of individuals is a particularly sensitive topic in air safety amid an increasing focus on litigation and, in some countries, a trend towards criminalising air accidents.




Under global rules, agencies carry out civil probes into air accidents for the sole purpose of finding the cause and making recommendations to improve safety in future. Such actions are separate from any judicial probes seeking to attribute blame.


Aviation experts say an 80-year-old international treaty that encourages people to speak freely and focus on causes rather than blame allowed the industry to cut the number of accidents dramatically since the start of the jet age, but depends on curbing any special pleading by the parties involved.


Critics, including some lawyers, say this system does not sufficiently take account of the need of the families of victims for detailed answers.


In 2013, the NTSB barred United Parcel Service (UPS.N), opens new tab and its pilots union from an investigation of a crash in Alabama that killed two UPS pilots.




In 2018, it removed Tesla as a party to an investigation into a fatal crash involving a vehicle's ""Autopilot"" system. Tesla hit back publicly, saying it had already decided to withdraw and accusing the NTSB of violating its own rules.

Manchester Airport flights resume after power cut chaos,"Flights at Manchester Airport have resumed after a power cut caused a day of chaos.


Up to 90,000 passengers were affected as flights were cancelled and scheduled arrivals diverted.


Check-in and departures at Terminal 1 and 2 have now fully re-started, the airport said in an update.


Officials said further disruption is not expected on Monday and they are working to reschedule cancelled flights and reunite passengers without their bags.


Airport managing director Chris Woodroofe said a ""fault with a cable had caused a power surge that took down security systems and baggage screening"".




Mr Woodroofe said: ""When Terminal 1 and 2 can't depart passengers for an entire morning there is going to be an impact.


""And I'm really sorry that happened and we're now making sure as we look forward, that impact doesn't carry on into tomorrow.""


He said an investigation into what happened would take place in the coming week.


'Mess'


Huge queues formed when a quarter of all flights from the airport had to be cancelled.




Passengers travelling via Terminals 1 and 2 had been told to stay away.


Aviation analytics company Cirium said that by lunchtime 66 outbound flights and 50 inbound were axed.


The disruption comes at the start of the summer holiday season at the UK's third-busiest airport, which has apologised to passengers.


Kelvin Knaver, of St Helens, Merseyside, had been due to fly to Amsterdam with EasyJet before his flight was cancelled.




He told BBC North West Tonight: ""It's been a mess.


""There's such a backlog that it's going to take forever to clear.""


Passenger Kelvin Knaver said the airport was a ""mess"" after his flight to Amsterdam was cancelled


Many people affected posted on social media photographs of long queues for check-in desks and passport control and complained of a lack of communication from staff.


Pictures and video footage showed long queues of people, some waiting in near darkness.




Mr Woodroofe had earlier said that power had been restored but that there would be no departures at all from the two terminals for the rest of the day.


More than 100 flights had been due to depart from the UK's largest airport outside London when the problems started, and many inbound flights had to be diverted.


The airport told the BBC inbound flights had been diverted because ""planes can’t take off"" due to limited space.


This made it harder to accept aircraft, which would be sent elsewhere, a spokesman said.




Among those affected was a flight arriving from Houston in Texas which had to go to London Heathrow while another, coming from Singapore, was forced to land at London Gatwick.


The airport urged passengers to contact their airlines


The airport's backup power came on when the primary system went down, but the situation was complicated by the mains power cutting out multiple times.


Airlines have said problems with baggage processing meant customers could only board with a cabin bag.


In a statement, Jet2 said handlers had been unable to load bags on to planes due to the outage.




An Easyjet spokesman said passengers could only board their flight with a cabin bag because of problems with the baggage system.


Passengers flying via Terminal 3 were also warned about delays.


'Chaos'


Bobbi Hadgraft, who is travelling to watch England at Euro 2024, told BBC Radio Manchester she arrived at the airport at about 04:00 BST to see ""enormous queues"" outside Terminal 1.


""We were worried we would miss our flight,"" she said, adding the power outage had affected display boards and scanners so staff had to direct passengers around the site.




Olwyn Hocking said one member of staff looked like they were trying to hide as ""hundreds and hundreds of people poured into the airport, with not a clue there was a problem"".


She said it was ""chaos"".


Flights travelling out of Terminal 1 and 2 have been affected by the power loss


Balázs Fazekas, who was due to fly to Montenegro for a week-long holiday with his wife and eight-month-old baby, arrived at 02:00 BST and, after eight hours standing in queues, found out the flight had been cancelled.


""There are bigger issues in life than this,"" he said, but added the lack of communication from the airport had been ""quite frustrating"".


Another passenger, Phillip Banfield, said his plane had taken off while he was stuck after going through passport control.


He said he was surrounded by an ""enormous number of passengers, stranded, wondering how they’re going to continue onward journeys"".


It had been ""virtually impossible"" to get through check-in and security, which was only feasible if you were just carrying hand luggage, he added.

Boeing crash victims families shout at CEO as he apologises in hearing,"Boeing's chief executive Dave Calhoun faced a grilling from US senators about the company's culture as he apologised to family members of plane crash victims, who shouted at him throughout the hearing.


Mr Calhoun testified on Tuesday to Congress that the company had ""learned"" from past mistakes and that the process for employee whistleblowers ""works"" - but lawmakers still accused him of not doing enough to rectify a culture of retaliation.


The US company most recently was put in the spotlight when a door panel fell off a new 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, leaving a gaping hole.


As part of an ongoing investigation, Boeing whistleblowers told the Senate in April that the 737 Max, the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 models had serious production issues.


Mr Calhoun, who became CEO in 2020 and plans to leave later this year, told the Senate sub-committee that some problems come from an ""untrained workforce"".




He blamed the layoffs and worker turnover that plagued the industry after Covid, saying they contributed to manufacturing issues at the company.


""So much of this is related to an untrained workforce. It's all about that, honestly,"" he said.


The company faced intense criticism five years ago, after two 737 Max aircraft were lost in separate, but almost identical accidents, killing 346 people.





Several family members of victims who died in those crashes attended the hearing, holding up pictures of loved ones. They spoke outside in a news conference beforehand.




“I flew from England to Washington DC to hear in person what the Boeing CEO has to say to the Senate and to the world about any safety improvements made at that corporation,” said Zipporah Kuria, whose father was killed in the 2019 crash of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet.


“I also continue to press the US government to hold Boeing and its corporate executives criminally responsible for the deaths of 346 people. We will not rest until we see justice.”


Clariss Moore, whose daughter died in a Boeing crash in Ethiopia in 2019, confronted Mr Calhoun, asking him during the hearing about “my daughter's last breath on the plane"".


""Did she call for me? Did someone hold her hands?"" she demanded.




Committee chairman Richard Blumenthal kicked off the tense hearing by thanking family members ""for having the strength and courage to be with us"".


He also demanded to know what Boeing was doing ""to end this broken safety culture"".


""I assure you that I listened to the whistleblowers,"" Mr Calhoun responded. 


He added that he had not spoken to whistleblowers and acknowledged company retaliation against several.




“I know it happens,” he said, adding that he does not know how many employees were fired or disciplined for speaking out about safety issues.





During the hearing, Mr Calhoun rose and turned to say sorry to the families for their losses.


""They're gut-wrenching,"" he said, his voice seeming to break with emotion, ""and I apologise for the grief that we have caused.""


Boeing chief engineer Howard McKenzie testified that there ""absolutely"" was a culture of safety first within Boeing's engineering team.




After the hearing ended, Senator Blumenthal told BBC News that he was not satisfied with the CEO's answers, and that his probe would continue.


""I have a lot more questions that need to be answered and we're going to be pursuing our investigation,"" he said.


In May, the US justice department informed Boeing that it launched a criminal investigation into its practices. 


Several family members on Tuesday said they hoped criminal charges would be filed against the company.

Under the theme “Celebrating our Legacy, Securing Your Future,” the event drew distinguished guests including the Chief of Staff, key government officials, members of the diplomatic corps, industry leaders, and stakeholders.


The Managing Director of Enterprise Insurance, Akosua Ansah-Antwi, in her speech traced the company’s roots back to 1924 when it began as an Agency office under Royal Exchange Assurance in the United Kingdom. 


""Enterprise Insurance has been a cornerstone in the foundation of not only Ghana's insurance landscape but also its economic stability,"" she stated. 


She highlighted the transition to a wholly Ghanaian-owned entity in the late '90s and its evolution into a leader on the Ghana Stock Exchange.







The Group CEO, Daniel Larbi-Tieku, also emphasised the interconnected growth of the subsidiaries: ""From the blueprint set by Enterprise Insurance, we have expanded into a formidable group, leading across various sectors. Our legacy is deeply intertwined with our commitment to innovation and excellence.""


In a speech read on his behalf, President Akufo-Addo praised the company’s century-long contribution to the nation's development.


""Enterprise Insurance has not only been a pioneer in the insurance industry but a bedrock of financial stability and trust for countless Ghanaians.""


The centenary celebration was not only about honouring the past but also about laying a robust foundation for the next hundred years. 




Enterprise Insurance’s continued dedication to excellence and customer satisfaction reaffirms its position as a pivotal player in not just the insurance sector but also in the broader economic spectrum of Ghana.


As guests danced and celebrated in the grandeur of the Grand Arena, the blue-themed night reflected the company’s corporate colours, symbolising stability, trust, and confidence—qualities that Enterprise Insurance has epitomised over its storied history.


With a successful centennial celebration under its belt, Enterprise Insurance looks to the future with optimism and a clear strategy to continue its legacy of service and innovation.

Held in collaboration with the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), the workshop was aimed at empowering participants with a comprehensive understanding and the applicability of ESG principles in their business operations.  


The workshop, which was organised under the theme ""Unlocking Sustainable Manufacturing: A Roadmap to Effective ESG Implementation"", brought together industry stakeholders to discuss the growing importance of incorporating ESG practices within the manufacturing industry.


The event attracted over 200 participants from various sub-sectors within the manufacturing industry comprising pharmaceutical, food, beverage, wood, water, textiles, clothing, and machinery, among others.


The workshop provided a platform for industry experts to share insights and best practices on ESG implementation, highlighting its benefits for businesses, the environment, and society at large.




In her welcome remarks, the Country Risk Officer of Ecobank, Joana Mensah said; “Ecobank is committed to being a leader in sustainability across our entire business. We recognize the critical role that financial institutions play in driving positive environmental and social change. 


""This commitment is reflected in our numerous sustainability initiatives, including supporting renewable energy projects and energy-efficient manufacturing technologies, and partnering with selected NGOs to promote sustainable agricultural practices.


""It can also be seen in our investment in social impact projects that empower communities and promote financial inclusion, and implementing robust environmental and social risk management frameworks throughout our lending processes.”


She concluded that Ecobank recognises the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in their sustainability journeys. 




That is why the bank chose to dedicate the first workshop specifically to its manufacturing sector clients, aimed at working with them to find ways to overcome their challenges and explore further opportunities.


The Group Head of Sustainability at Ecobank, Rachael Antwi, highlighted the Ecobank group’s commitment to reinforcing its position as the pacesetter in ESG and sustainability through promoting sustainable financing solutions and strategic partnerships across various sectors. 


She also expressed the bank’s commitment to supporting the manufacturing sector to operate sustainably to ensure business continuity and to contribute to the overall national sustainability agenda across the continent.


On his part, Mr. Seth Twum-Akwaboah, CEO of AGI, applauded Ecobank for its long-standing support of the association and expressed his delight in learning about the Bank of Ghana’s requirement for commercial banks to evaluate ESG standards of companies as an additional parameter in business support decisions. 




He acknowledged the critical role of ESG standards in shaping business practices. 


He then highlighted AGI’s efforts to promote sustainable practices among its members, such as establishing the AGI Energy Service Centre to assist companies in adopting energy efficiency and renewable energy through their high-quality training and consultancy services.


Contributors included the Head of the Sustainability Office at the Banking Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana, Stephen Armah, who enlightened participants on the impact of the Central Bank’s principles on sustainable business practices.


Mr. Osei Kwaku Adjaye-Gyamfi, Director of the Technical and Research Department of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Ghana then prepared the minds of participants for upcoming regulatory frameworks, including the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (IFRS S1 and S2).




The PR and Projects Manager for AGI, Isaac Kofi Batini took his turn with a discussion on “Leveraging Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technologies for Business Sustainability and Competitiveness” which introduced participants to the importance of adopting renewable energy alternatives in their operations. 


Finally, the Acting Director and Head of the Environmental Assessment and Audit  Unit of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andriana Naa Kwakor Nelson, presented “Beyond Compliance: Using Environmental Regulations as a Springboard for Sustainable Innovation.” 


This was aimed at creating awareness of the regulatory environmental requirements and initiatives.


Participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the programme, especially the breakout session, which allowed them to discuss among themselves and also seek further insights from the presenters.




They applauded Ecobank for such a laudable initiative.

Bank of Ghana to issue climate risk directive to commercial banks,"The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has completed a draft document on climate risk assessment to be issued to the commercial banks operating in the country.


This directive is expected to guide banks and other deposit taking institutions on how to asses disaster and other climate risk factors during acquisition of loans. Director of Sustainability at the Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana, Stephen Armah disclosed this during an interaction with Small and Medium Enterprise Businesses at the Absa SME clinic in commemoration of this year’s world MSME day under the theme; adopting ESG practices for business growth.


“This Directive sets out the supervisory expectations for stakeholders in relation to the approach to management and disclosure of climate-related financial risks


with a focus on corporate governance, internal control framework, assessment of adequacy of capital and liquidity, risk management process, management monitoring and reporting, comprehensive management of specific financial risks, scenario analysis and disclosures” he noted.


At the same event, interim Managing Director for Absa Bank, Adolph Kpegah assured SMEs that the bank will continue to provide such platforms as the SME clinic to support knowledge sharing on their business growth.




The event underscores the bank’s commitment to promoting sustainable business practices within the SME sector.


The clinic aimed to educate SME owners on the importance and benefits of integrating environmental, social and governance practices into their operations.


Bank of Ghana (BOG) recognizes that Regulated Financial Institutions (RFIs)


In Ghana are potentially exposed to climate-related financial risks regardless of their size, complexity or business model, and that climate-related financial risk drivers can translate into traditional financial risk categories including: credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. According to the draft document,




RFIs shall therefore consider the potential impacts of climate-related risk drivers


On their individual business models and assess the financial materiality of these risks.


RFIs in Ghana are also expected to manage their climate-related financial risks in a manner that is proportional to the nature, scale and complexity of their activities and the overall level of risk that it is willing and able to accept.


The aim of this Directive is to enhance the management of climate-related financial risks by RFIs and, consequently, contribute to a more resilient financial system in Ghana that can effectively contribute to sustainable

GCB Bank PLC posts strong financial performance in 2023,"GCB Bank PLC has posted a remarkable financial performance during the 2023 financial year, indicating resilience following a robust post-DDEP recovery and also laying the foundation for a sustainable future.


The Bank reported a substantial profit before tax of GHS1,547.4 million, transitioning from a loss of GHS743.5 million in 2022. The performance is a demonstration of the strong earning capability of the Bank.


Commenting on the Bank’s performance, the Managing Director of GCB Bank PLC (GCB), Kofi Adomakoh,  said, “We reported our best-ever profit before tax of GHS1,547.4 million in our platinum anniversary year. Our strong rebound to profit after the adverse effect of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) in the prior year is testament to the successful implementation of our strategy and confidence and loyalty of our large and growing client base. 


""Our relentless focus on improving customer experience and commitment to make a positive impact to all our stakeholders will strengthen our competitive advantage, enable us deliver sustainable and improved returns and dominate the market.”


The Bank achieved strong revenue growth across its business segments, emphasizing its diversified business model amid market challenges. Total revenue for the period reached GHS3,784.2 million, marking a 26 percent increase from the previous period's revenue of GHS3,005.7 million. Net Interest Income (NII) reached GHS2,895.7 million, showcasing a substantial growth of 37 percent compared to the prior financial year. 




Net fees and commission income for the year increased by 14 percent to GHS438.2 million, compared to GHS385.0 million in 2022. Growth in client base combined with an intensified focus on transaction banking helped to improve net fees and commission income. However, net trading income dipped 13 percent from GHS487.2 million in 2022 to GHS425.1 million in 2023 due to lower trading volume.





In 2023, the Bank ended the year with operating expenses totaling GHS 1,814.7 million, indicating a year-on-year growth rate of 11 percent.


The impairment charge for the year decreased substantially by 79 percent settling at GHS 432.9 million in 2023 compared to GHS 2,74.1 million in 2022. The high impairment charge in the prior year reflects losses on government securities arising mainly from the DDEP.


The Bank's balance sheet improved significantly over the previous year, growing from GHS 21,494.4 million in 2022 to GHS 27,155.7 million in 2023, indicating an increase of 26 percent. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits by 23 percent to reach GHS 21,781.4 million, compared to the GHS 17,775.1 million recorded in 2022. Shareholders' funds rose from GHS 1,998.9 million in 2022 to GHS 3,080.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 54 percent increase.




In 2023, the Bank’s financial performance indicators showed a positive trend. The Bank recorded Earnings per share (EPS) of GHS 3.81, Return on Equity (ROE) of 40 percent and Return on Assets (ROA) of 4 percent. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 48 percent from 54 percent, indicating robust cost optimization and containment despite persistent inflationary pressures and exchange rate depreciation. Furthermore, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (with regulatory forbearance) stood at 19 percent, surpassing the regulatory limit of 10 percent and the prior year's figure of 18 percent.


The 2023 performance exhibits the Bank’s commitment to deliver on its brand promise, “Your Bank for Life”, through a strong focus on its strategic objectives of revenue growth and profitability, operational excellence and people and talent development.


During the year the Bank made significant progress in its efforts to drive revenue growth, improve profitability and grow its market share. The results for the year 2023 therefore benefitted from internal collaboration, enhanced relationship management and targeted marketing strategies. This helped to increase the customer base across all segments and transaction volumes.


The Bank also invested in a resilient IT infrastructure to support scale, security and reliability.




It additionally rolled out its Leadership Development Programme aimed at preparing employees for leadership roles. This was in line with the strategic objective of “People and Talent Development” which involved the cultivation of talent and nurturing of future leaders.


The Bank’s performance was further cemented by an expanded effort to support its communities and livelihoods with a key focus on youth, the environment, education and health. A total of GHS6.3 million was invested into projects and initiatives which support its social responsibility agenda. This brought benefits to millions of Ghanaians, guaranteeing them a better future.


GCB’s 2023 performance has certainly laid a solid foundation for a sustainable performance in the years ahead. This is evidenced by the impressive First Quarter 2024 results where the Bank posted GHS 411.6 million, marking a 37 percent increase compared to the prior year corresponding period.


The outlook of GCB is positive as conveyed by Mr. Adomakoh to shareholders at the 30th Annual General Meeting. 




He said “As I look to the future, I do so with a sense of optimism and confidence. Despite economic uncertainties and rapid technological disruption, GCB Bank is well positioned to advance further its market share and viability, leveraging its core strengths to effectively execute our strategy to achieve superior client experience, strong, sustainable and profitable business growth and operational excellence.


“We will continue to leverage our respected brand and strategic partnerships and invest to capitalize on emerging opportunities that will strengthen our competitive advantages in 2024 and the years ahead,” concluded Mr. Adomakoh.

Yango and Guinness launch a nationwide Dont Drink and Drive Campaign with special focus on road safety in Ghana,"International ride-hailing service Yango has partnered with Guinness Ghana PLC to launch a new safety initiative aimed at preventing drunk driving accidents, promoting safe mobility and ensuring both drivers and passengers are safe at all times.


A continuous ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’ will include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers.


This includes in app notifications, regular training, out of home marketing campaigns and many advertisements.


The safety forum, which is a first step in the campaign covered topics such as recognizing signs of impairment, strategies for preventing drunk driving, and how to use alternative transportation options such as ride-hailing services like Yango.


The training was provided by certified instructors and was available to all Yango partner drivers and passengers free of charge.







This was attended by over 150 participants which cut across Yango’s partners, partner drivers, passengers and authorities from many safety organizations across the country.


As part of the ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’, Yango and Guinness organized a safety training to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence as well as highlight the many safety features Yango has provided for both partner drivers and passengers.


The ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’ will also include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers. This includes in app notifications, regular training, out of home marketing campaigns and many advertisements. Yango and Guinness are working together to create a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community


“We are committed to promoting responsible road practices and ensuring the safety of passengers and partner drivers. By partnering with Guinness Ghana PLC , we hope to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and provide the community with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe and responsible choices. We are excited to contribute our quota in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the country. Safety is a fundamental need and plays a key role in our vision to create income generating opportunities for partner drivers while providing affordable and convenient transportation for passengers” said  Ofonime Tom, Country Manager of Yango Ghana.




The Safety Forum also featured a panel discussion which had experts from the health and safety industry to speak on road ethics, crime, safety techniques and measures to ensure the safety and security of both the partner drivers and passengers. The panel consisted of Mr. Eric Komla Kwakuyi, Regional Safety & Security Officer at Yango, Lynessa Darko, Sustainability and Responsibility Manager at Guinness Ghana PLC and Mr. Damoah Emmanuel Nyarkoh, Director of Safety Campaign Ghana.


Lynessa Darko, Sustainability and Responsibility Manager at Guinness Ghana PLC expressed optimism about the campaign and safety training while encouraging more ride-hailing companies to follow the footsteps of Yango in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of their key stakeholders.


She said ‘’Safeguarding our community is very important in national development. Ensuring that as brands and companies, we play our roles in providing adequate safety education and awareness to help drivers and passengers stay alert on the roads while knowing the dangers of drunk driving is the first step to achieving a safe and sound environment viable for economic growth’’.


The beneficiary partner drivers received certificates of participation to confirm that they have successfully gone through the safety training and are fully aware of the many safety features provided by Yango for partner drivers such as display of passenger ratings, identity photo checks in special cases, display of alert zones and non-penalty configuration for drivers to be able to skip orders to the alert zones, display of passenger profile picture, rating form to evaluate riders and in-app calls to support.




The passengers who attended the training also expressed their gratitude to Yango and Guinness for putting together this initiative and pledged to use the knowledge acquired to ensure their safety and the safety of other road users. Some of the safety features available to passengers include rating form to evaluate trips, display of driver rating, safety center (this houses the share route, ambulance and police, trusted contacts and emergency situation buttons), SOS button, support team which acts promptly, drivers document checks among others.


This move is in line with Yango’s launch of the ‘’Safety Talk Series’’ last month which saw the company visit and educate students, faculty members and the general public at the University of Ghana during their SRC week celebrations. Yango and Guinness are working together to create a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community.

Cyberattacks cost Israels economy $3bn in 2023 alone,"Israel lost 12 billion shekels equivalent to $3 billion to cyberattacks in 2023. That’s according to Director General of Israel National Cyber Directorate, Gaby Portnoy. Addressing a delegation of journalists from across the globe ahead of the Cyber Week celebration, Mr. Portnoy revealed that the country lost this much due to the War launched by Palestine on Israel.


According to him, cyberattacks have tripled since October 7, 2023 with the Computer Emergency Response Centre (CERT) receiving about 500 emergency calls per day from an average of 50 calls before the war.


Israel on October 7, 2023 was attacked by Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza strip. This is the fifth war of the Gaza-Israel conflict since 2008 which is part of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since the attack, 1,576 people have been killed and 120 people taken as hostages.


Gaby Portnoy said, “the war began with a hack into cameras, smart houses and billboards” which guided the opponent as this helped in accumulating information from delicate government intel to the least as a whatsapp group of mothers discussing the daily routine of their children.


However, Mr. Portnoy disclosed that “135 infrastructure of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas have been taken down” which were used to launch 1,992 attacks since the beginning of the war.




In his presentation to the journalists, he highlighted that the digital service, government and communication were the most targeted sectors. A further explanation indicated that the digital service had the highest attacks with a focus on the use of cyberterrorism, social media influence and artificial intelligence (AI) as the main medium used by cyber attackers to infiltrate Israel’s cyber space.


In tackling cyberattacks during the war, Mr. Portnoy outlined a three-layered approach which are; regulation, operation and education. According to him, “government has intensified policies that protect the cyberspace of state agencies, corporations and startups. Israel has equipped the Computer Emergency Response Centre to immediately attend to emergency calls and tapped into the military reserves when the war begun. Lastly, we have developed a great sense of awareness by educating everyone on sighting any form of attack and report it”.


Meanwhile, Gaby Portnoy stated that the war despite its disadvantages has taught the country three things, “constant change is a reality, cooperation and navigation”.


He believes the Israeli-Palestinian war is the beginning of a digital/information revolution as the current war is not limited to physical attacks or violence.




In another meeting with journalists, Head of the National Computer Emergency Response Centre at the Israel National Cyber Directorate, Dana Toren revealed that her outfit received 13,040 reports of cyberattacks in 2023. This was 43 percent higher than the number of attacks recorded in 2022.


According to her, “cyberattacks before October 7 were targeted at theft of information and after October 7 were cybercrimes targeted at inciting damage to Israel”.


In her over 20 years’ experience of developing a strong defense for Israel with specialisation in protecting the cyberspace of businesses, Dana Toren advised corporations to have a “strong business continuity plan” to help them recover from cyberattacks and to “learn from others” in order not to repeat the same mistakes or encounter the same problems.


The Cyber Week which is happening from 24th to 27th June, 2024 in Israel, is an annual international cybersecurity conference that offers a unique gathering of cybersecurity experts, industry leaders, startups, investors, academics, diplomats and government officials.

UCC honours EOCOs Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah,"The University of Cape Coast (UCC), has honoured the Executive Director of the EConomic and Organised Crime Office(EOCO), COP Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah for strengthening the relationship between the premier institution and the Ghana Police Service.


The Department of Forensic Sciences at the University of Cape Coast  (UCC) and the Ghana Police Service in 2018 entered into an agreement for personnel of the Ghana Police Service to be trained in Crime Scene Investigation, Criminal Investigation, Cyber Security, Digital Forensics, Document Examination, and Financial Fraud Investigation.


The Memorandum of Understanding solidified the cooperation between the two government institutions in their respective quests to improve crime prevention and detection and also bring to life the then Inspector-General of Police’s vision to revamp the Criminal Investigations Department of the Ghana Police Service.


In furtherance of this, COP Tiwaa Addo-Danquah who was then the Director General of the Criminal Investigations Department(CID) of the Ghana Police Service, championed the establishment of the a Digital Forensic Laboratory which was supposed to have been up and running by the end of 2019.


She said even though the department already has a crime laboratory for running DNA, ballistic, handwriting and other tests, the Digital Forensic laboratory would come to support the level of evidence that could be obtained to prosecute suspected criminals even with regard to traditional crimes.




This came about after it emerged that the Ghana Police Service does not have a digital forensic laboratory that will be used for forensic examinations on exhibits retrieved in the course of investigations.


The absence of the facility had deprived the Police Service, the ability to properly preserve volatile digital evidence, according to the Cybercrime Unit (CU) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) until its establishment.


The unit that worked closely with the UCC, saw COP Maame Yaa give off her best with the creation and establishment of two award schemes at the Department of Forensic Sciences for outstanding students to encourage others to venture into those disciplines


In recognition of her meritorious contributions, the Department in a citation said “ This is in recognition of the unconditional commitment you have demonstrated towards promoting and developing education in the field of forensic sciences. Your exceptional leadership, inspiration and pioneering role have helped to establish the relationship between the Ghana Police Service and the Department of Forensic Sciences, University of Cape Coast"".




""Your passion for academic excellence and professional development resulted in the creation and establishment of two award schemes at the Department of Forensic Sciences for outstanding students. The Department of Forensic Sciences is grateful for your consistent support of academic success and acknowledges your accomplishments as a remarkable woman of greatness and valour”, it concluded.

iSmart International, headquartered in Ghana with a branch in Cote d'Ivoire, specialises in providing seamless payment solutions and value-added services tailored to the dynamic retail industry landscape.


Its core services include Payment Solutions, under which it offers comprehensive payment solutions that cater to diverse needs in the retail sector. 


This includes facilitating USSD payment collections for various entities, including presidential aspirants, ensuring efficient and secure transactions.


It also engages in SMS Traffic Termination for Ecobank, ensuring reliable communication channels between the bank and its customers in Ghana.




The company again provides bundled service packages for major institutions in Ghana such as GPRTU (Ghana Private Road Transport Union), GRNMA (Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association), UPNMG (Union of Professional Nurses and Midwives, Ghana), and tertiary institutions. 


These services enhance operational efficiency and streamline communication.


For what it does, iSmart interacts with a lot of customer data and information, which requires that it meets high global standards from information security and management.





ISO 27001:2022 certification requires companies to meet rigorous standards for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). 




The certification process includes a comprehensive assessment of the applicant's security practices, policies, and controls to ensure they align with the international standards set by ISO.


In summary, the requirements include Risk Assessment and Management, Information Security Policies, Access Control, Incident Management, Employee Training and Awareness, Continuous Monitoring and Improvement, and Compliance with Legal and Regulatory Requirements.

""It assures our clients that we adhere to internationally recognised best practices in information security, enhancing trust, credibility, and compliance with regulatory requirements,"" he said.


Meanwhile, there have been concerns about the fact that individual institutions may have the best data protection measures in place, but their partners and other stakeholders within the ecosystem could compromise customer information due to poor practice at their end.




However, Robert Oduro noted that the ISO 27001:2022 certification also means that iSmart is in the position to provide comprehensive protection across its entire ecosystem by integrating stringent security measures at all levels.


""We enforce compliance with these standards among our suppliers and partners, ensuring consistent data protection throughout the value chain,"" he said.

SSNIT pledges further stakeholder engagement on hotels sale after NPRA directive,"The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) has revealed that it has halted negotiations leading to the sale of a 60 per cent stake in some six hotels. This is in line with a directive from the National Pensions Regulatory Authority, NPRA.


The Director General of SSNIT, Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo disclosed this at a media engagement on the operations of the State Pension Trust.


He however added they will embark on more stakeholder engagement on the matter, to let all the partners and actors appreciate the need to reduce their interest in these hotels so they can get more from their investment in the sector.


Mr Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo insisted that its stake in Labadi Beach Hotel has not been sold, adding even before this action by the National Pensions Regulatory Authority, negotiations had stalled, “on the payment model and other concerns that had come up.


The Director General of SSNIT added that these negotiations were done in good faith to ensure that they get the best out of SSNIT’s assets.




Asked whether SSNIT would have gone through the same route looking at the current challenges with the sale, the Director General said, “More engagement with all the interested parties would have helped to avoid all these current challenges.”


The Director maintained that “at a point in time, when assets are not performing a decision has to be taken, hence the need to sell some interest in these hotels.


“If anyone presents an offer that will help us get the best why don’t we take it “he noted.


NPRA’s instruction to suspend process




The Director General of SSNIT however described the letter coming from the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) as surprising, looking at the fact that they had engaged them on these issues.


“We had met the Authority on all these issues only that our last meeting was inconclusive because we also had to go to the presidency for another stakeholder engagement with the Unions.


Background


The National Pensions Regulatory Authority NPRA in a letter directed the Social Security and National Insurance Trust to halt negotiations leading to the sale of its interest in some of the hotels owned by SSNIT to Rock City, a company owned by the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Bryan Acheampong.




The NPRA in that letter also revealed that it is engaging the Minister for Employment on this issue and other developments. Even before the NPRA sent this letter to the SSNIT, organized labour had been engaging with the government over the sale of these hotels, raising some objections to the process.


The Director General of SSNIT justified the sale insisting some of the hotels have failed over the years to pay dividends to SSNIT, while some have been incurring losses.


“Therefore, the institution took a decision to reduce their interest in these hotels so that they can share the risk with a strategic investor going forward.”


He revealed that in the case of La Palm, it has made losses in 11 years out of 15 years, and those who even did the valuation told them to pull the hotel down.




“SSNIT had long taken that decision to restructure interest in non-performing assets, including these hotels” the Director General of SSNIT noted.


“We have been faced with consistent losses by some of these hotels, frequent requests for maintenance funding, capital injection requirement, high expenditure cost.”


Procurement and Selection Process of a strategic Investor and valuation


According to the SSNIT head, the decision to dispose of some of their interest in these hotels started in 2018, when the board set up a steering committee.




“The committee comprised all the Board Chairpersons of the various hotels, three Board members and some management staff from SSNIT” he added.


The Director General added that the selection of SEM capital to carry out the valuation was done appropriately, denying the assertion that, they hand-picked the transaction advisers.


“SSNIT went through International Competitive Tendering (ICT) processes as prescribed by the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (ACT 663), as amended by ACT 914, for the selection of a strategic investor” Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo.


“The Trust engaged a Transaction Advisor through the ICT method of procurement, with the publication of advertisements in the Daily Graphic on 14th November 2018 and in the Ghanaian Times on 15th November 2018. As of the 16th January 2019 deadline, fifteen (15) firms had expressed interest in submitting bids “he noted.




He added that approval was sought from the Central Tender Review Committee (CTRC) for the selection of a Transaction Advisor on 12th December 2019 and it was granted on 24th December 2019.He also revealed that advertisements for an Expression of Interest (EOI) for a Strategic Partner for SSNIT Hotels were placed in the Daily Graphic on 3rd February 2022 and in the Ghanaian Times on 7th February 2022.


“The advertisement was also published in the Economist Magazine on 26th February, 2022” he added.


He said a total of nine (9) companies responded to the advertisements by submitting proposals on the 23rd March 2022 deadline.


According to him, the Entity Tender Committee (ETC), on 25th May 2022 considered the evaluation report on the EOI and approved the recommendation to invite the six (6) firms that qualified for the evaluation of the EOI to submit Technical and Financial Proposals for Private Participation in SSNIT-Owned Hotels.




These are Rock City Hotel Limited, Yaw Addo Development, Spartan-Ives, Temple Investments, Westridge Developers Ghana Limited, and Luxor Hotels Limited.


The Director General added that the bidding was done in a lot system, with the Hotels that were heavily bid being Labadi Beach and La Palm Hotel.”


Concerns of Interference and political exposure issues


The Director General of SSNIT also rejected allegations that undue pressure had been brought on them to sell their interest in some hotels to Rock City.


“We went through all the right processes to settle on this strategic investor”.


He also challenged claims that at the time of submitting their bid documents, Rock City had not been issued with a tax certificate by the Ghana Revenue Authority.


The Director General of SSNIT also admitted that issues about political exposure regarding this strategic investor may have played a role in the current opposition to this deal by sections of the public and some trade unions.


The Director General of SSNIT also rejected claims by former New Patriotic Party Chairman, Freddie Blay that, Spartan-Ives offered 200 million dollars for the purchase of the hotels.


“Freddie Blay only presented a bid and even that was 150 million dollars,” the Director General of SSNIT revealed.

"Petrol price to go up 2%, LPG by 5% from July 1, 2024  IES","The price of petrol is expected to go up by 2.0% from July 1, 2024, for the next two weeks, the Institute for Energy Security has revealed.


At the same time, the price of diesel will surge by 4.0%, whilst that of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) will shoot up by 5%.


The expected increase in fuel prices is due to the depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar and the increase in the prices of finished petroleum products on the international market.


“Following the negative price changes recorded on the international market for petroleum products adding to the consistent fall (-1.85%) of the Ghana Cedi, fuel prices at the local pumps are expected to surge. Considering the developments in the foreign fuel market and the domestic forex market, the Institute for Energy Security (IES) anticipates an increase in fuel prices in the first half of July 2024, on account of the worsening performance of the Ghana cedi”.


World Fuel Market




The IES said its monitoring of the global Standard & Poor's (S&P's) Platts on petroleum products performance in the world fuel market shows that the price of petrol, diesel, and LPG increased in the second pricing window for June 2024.


The published data for the second pricing window of June 2024 showed that petrol closed at $816.61 per metric tonne. Diesel went for $778.32 per metric tonne, and LPG closed at $477.80 per metric tonne. The net changes indicate that the price of petrol has increased by 1.45%, diesel by 6.84%, and LPG by 9.03%.


Local Fuel Market Performance


The IES daily monitoring of activities on the domestic fuel market for the second pricing window for June 2024 observed relative stability in the price for liquid fuels from Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).




Diesel and petrol sold at GH₡14.06 and GH₡14.26 per litre respectively, whereas LPG went for GH₡15.96 per kilogramme.

Enterprise Insurance celebrates 100 with a grand ball,"Enterprise Insurance has marked a monumental milestone with a grand ball at the Grand Arena in Accra, celebrating a century of service and dedication to the Ghanaian economy.


Under the theme “Celebrating our Legacy, Securing Your Future,” the event drew distinguished guests including the Chief of Staff, key government officials, members of the diplomatic corps, industry leaders, and stakeholders.


The Managing Director of Enterprise Insurance, Akosua Ansah-Antwi, in her speech traced the company’s roots back to 1924 when it began as an Agency office under Royal Exchange Assurance in the United Kingdom. 


""Enterprise Insurance has been a cornerstone in the foundation of not only Ghana's insurance landscape but also its economic stability,"" she stated. 


She highlighted the transition to a wholly Ghanaian-owned entity in the late '90s and its evolution into a leader on the Ghana Stock Exchange.







The Group CEO, Daniel Larbi-Tieku, also emphasised the interconnected growth of the subsidiaries: ""From the blueprint set by Enterprise Insurance, we have expanded into a formidable group, leading across various sectors. Our legacy is deeply intertwined with our commitment to innovation and excellence.""


In a speech read on his behalf, President Akufo-Addo praised the company’s century-long contribution to the nation's development.


""Enterprise Insurance has not only been a pioneer in the insurance industry but a bedrock of financial stability and trust for countless Ghanaians.""


The centenary celebration was not only about honouring the past but also about laying a robust foundation for the next hundred years. 




Enterprise Insurance’s continued dedication to excellence and customer satisfaction reaffirms its position as a pivotal player in not just the insurance sector but also in the broader economic spectrum of Ghana.


As guests danced and celebrated in the grandeur of the Grand Arena, the blue-themed night reflected the company’s corporate colours, symbolising stability, trust, and confidence—qualities that Enterprise Insurance has epitomised over its storied history.


With a successful centennial celebration under its belt, Enterprise Insurance looks to the future with optimism and a clear strategy to continue its legacy of service and innovation.

"Enhanced incentive and regulatory frameworks needed in Ghanas oil palm sector, study reveals","A recent Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) and Proforest study has underscored the critical need for improved incentive and regulatory frameworks to unlock value chain opportunities in Ghana’s oil palm sector.


The research highlights the potential for creating jobs, protecting the environment, and enhancing rural development through prioritised research, land access, RSPO certification, and sustainable practices.


The study engaged oil palm producers in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western, and Central regions, providing several key insights.


Out-grower schemes, which connect smallholder farmers with buyers in value chains, offer mutual benefits by granting smallholders market access, inputs, and technical support through contract farming.


The oil palm processing industry also yields products such as crude palm oil, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel cake, with crude palm oil dominating production. Additionally, the study found that oil palm waste can be converted into valuable products like organic fertiliser, fibres, and boiler fuel for steam and electricity in large-scale mills.




The research, which includes case studies from Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire, aims to attract investment in sustainable oil palm development by engaging governments, development partners, investors, and private sector companies.





It identifies several key areas for investment. Government ministries, such as those of Food and Agriculture, Trade and Industry, and Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation, play crucial roles in creating an enabling environment to attract financial investors, NGOs, and donor partners.


Private sector agencies, including the Association of Ghana Industries and the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are pivotal in boosting investment attraction.


The government offers incentives such as free seedlings, free zone waivers (covering import tariffs, VAT, and tax holidays), and subsidies for inputs to promote oil palm development.




Moreover, investment opportunities exist in primary production, processing, and converting oil palm trunks (OPT) and fronds (OPF) into valuable products.


Public sector support programs like Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) are available, though there are limitations in the technical capacity for policy implementation.


However, the study also highlights several challenges. Land tenure conflicts are a significant barrier to investment, and smallholder out-growers often struggle with financial literacy and access to funds. Regulatory compliance issues, such as current non-compliance with import regulations, present bottlenecks. Additionally, currency depreciation and price fluctuations pose risks for the sector.


To address these challenges, the study offers several key recommendations, including strengthening the incentive framework and improving law enforcement to mitigate investment risks.




It also recommends enhancement of regulatory frameworks and encouraging circular economy investments to boost employment opportunities and wealth creation as well as promoting smallholder inclusion in value chains, particularly through, out-grower schemes, to resource-poor farmers.

IPPs Chamber rejects Finance Ministers haircut claim,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Independent Power Generators, Ghana (IPPS), Dr. Elikplim Kwabla Apetorgbor, has dismissed the Minister of Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam’s assertion that the IPPs has agreed to a haircut after six years of negotiation with the Government of Ghana.


According to him, the Minister’s statement is misleading and inaccurate.


In a statement copied to Joy Business, he said, the last engagement of some IPPs with the Government of Ghana's negotiating team occurred in April 2024, and since then, no agreement on any terms has been reached.


“It has come to our attention that the Minister of Finance has made public statements indicating that a deal has been reached with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) regarding debt restructuring. We must categorically state that this assertion is misleading and inaccurate”.


“The last engagement with some of the IPPs and the Government of Ghana's negotiating team occurred in April [2024] and since then, no agreement on any terms has been reached. The posture and generalisation that the government has secured a debt restructuring agreement with the IPPs are misleading and amount to public deception”, he added.




“We urge the Minister of Finance to refrain from making such inaccurate statements and to engage in transparent and honest communications”, he pointed out.


He concluded that the IPPs remain committed to constructive dialogue and finding a mutually beneficial resolution to the ongoing discussions.


Joy Business understands that only two IPPs, CenPower and Amandi accepted the government’s proposal to restructure the IPPs' debt.


The rest, Karpowership, Twin City Energy, Sunon Asogli, Cenit Energy and AKSA rejected the haircut proposal by the Government of Ghana




The Finance Minister in a statement in London said the IPPs agreement includes accepting a reduction in their claims (haircut), allowing the government to spread payment over five years.


“The negotiations have been going on for six years, and I am happy to announce that last week, l closed the negotiations with the IPPs,"" he revealed.

Priority setting strategies and executions for Ghanaian and African CEOs,"In the dynamic and rapidly evolving business landscapes of Ghana and Africa, CEOs face unique challenges that require strategic agility and forward-thinking. Setting priorities effectively is crucial for driving sustainable growth, fostering innovation, and ensuring the resilience of organizations. 


This article delves into the priority-setting strategies and executions employed by Ghanaian and African CEOs, highlighting their approaches to navigating the complexities of the regional and global markets.


Understanding the Context


The African continent, with its rich diversity and vast economic potential, presents both opportunities and challenges for business leaders. Ghana, as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, exemplifies this duality. CEOs in this region must address issues such as infrastructural deficits, regulatory hurdles, and socio-political instability, while also leveraging opportunities in emerging markets, technological advancements, and a young, vibrant workforce.


Strategic Priority Setting




1. Visionary Leadership and Long-term Goals: 


Successful CEOs in Ghana and Africa often start with a clear vision and long-term goals that align with their organization’s mission. This vision provides a roadmap that guides decision-making and priority setting. For instance, Strive Masiyiwa, CEO of Econet, emphasizes a long-term vision of transforming Africa through technology and connectivity, which shapes the strategic priorities of his company. Similarly, Patrick Awuah, founder and president of Ashesi University in Ghana, envisions an African renaissance driven by ethical, entrepreneurial leaders educated at Ashesi. His long-term goal is to expand the university's impact across the continent. Dr. Daniel McKorley, Group CEO of McDan Group, also exemplifies visionary leadership, with a focus on transforming logistics and aviation in Ghana and beyond. His long-term goals include expanding McDan Group’s footprint across Africa and establishing Ghana as a key logistics hub in the region.


2. Stakeholder Engagement:


Effective priority setting involves engaging with key stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, and the community. This collaborative approach ensures that the priorities reflect the needs and aspirations of those who have a vested interest in the company’s success. Patrick Awuah prioritizes stakeholder engagement to ensure that their strategies are inclusive and comprehensive. Raymond Bismarck, CEO of IZWE Savings and Loans in Ghana, regularly engages with stakeholders to understand their perspectives and align the company's strategies with their expectations.




3. Market and Competitor Analysis:


Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for setting strategic priorities. CEOs must continuously analyze market trends, competitor strategies, and customer preferences to identify growth opportunities and potential threats. For example, Aliko Dangote of the Dangote Group prioritizes market expansion and diversification based on thorough market research and competitor analysis. In Ghana, Ebenezer Asante, former CEO of MTN Ghana, emphasized understanding the local market dynamics and customer behavior to drive MTN's growth and maintain its market leadership. George Owusu Ansah, former CEO of Unilever Ghana, is another notable leader who leveraged in-depth market and competitor analysis to maintain Unilever’s competitive edge and expand its market share in Ghana.


4. Innovation and Technology Adoption:


Embracing innovation and leveraging technology are key priorities for modern CEOs. In Ghana and Africa, where digital transformation is rapidly unfolding, CEOs prioritize investments in technology to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and drive growth. Tunde Folawiyo, CEO of Yinka Folawiyo Group, focuses on technological advancements to stay competitive and agile. Albert Essien, former CEO of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, championed the adoption of digital banking solutions to reach unbanked populations and improve financial inclusion. Moses Baiden, CEO of Margins Group in Ghana, is another notable leader who prioritizes innovation, particularly in the fields of secure identity solutions and digital transformation, to propel his company forward.




Execution of Strategic Priorities


1. Resource Allocation:


Effective execution of strategic priorities requires prudent allocation of resources, including financial, human, and technological assets. CEOs must ensure that resources are directed toward high-impact areas that align with their strategic goals. This often involves making tough decisions and reallocating resources from underperforming segments to more promising initiatives. For example, Kelvin Doe, CEO of the Rising Academies Network in Ghana, strategically allocates resources to expand educational opportunities and improve learning outcomes across the region. Rayan Sharara, CEO of Orca Decor Ghana, is known for his strategic allocation of resources to optimize operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction, ensuring the company remains competitive in the decor industry.


2. Building a High-Performance Culture:




A high-performance culture is essential for executing strategic priorities. CEOs must foster an environment that encourages innovation, accountability, and continuous improvement. This involves setting clear performance expectations, providing regular feedback, and recognizing and rewarding high achievers. Fred Swaniker, CEO of the African Leadership Group, emphasizes building a culture of excellence to drive the execution of his organization’s strategic priorities. In Ghana, Nana Kwame Bediako, CEO of Kwarleyz Group, is known for cultivating a high-performance culture that values creativity and innovation. Hayssam Fakhry, CEO of Interplast, also prioritizes building a high-performance culture, emphasizing continuous training, and development to enhance employee capabilities and drive company success.


3. Risk Management and Adaptability: 


In the volatile business environment of Ghana and Africa, risk management and adaptability are critical for successful execution. CEOs must develop robust risk management frameworks to identify, assess, and mitigate risks. Additionally, they must remain adaptable, ready to pivot their strategies in response to changing circumstances. Njeri Rionge, CEO of Ignite Consulting, highlights the importance of agility in responding to market disruptions and emerging opportunities. Kenneth Thompson, CEO of Dalex Finance in Ghana, emphasizes proactive risk management and adaptability in navigating the financial services sector. Mansa Nettey, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Ghana, exemplifies these qualities by implementing comprehensive risk management practices and maintaining strategic flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing financial landscape.


4. Performance Monitoring and Evaluation: 




Continuous monitoring and evaluation of performance are vital for ensuring that strategic priorities are being effectively executed. CEOs must establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly review progress against these metrics. This allows them to identify areas for improvement, make necessary adjustments, and ensure accountability across the organization. Kojo Annan, CEO of Africa10, underscores the importance of rigorous performance monitoring to drive the success of his sports and entertainment ventures in Africa. Julian Opuni, CEO of Fidelity Bank Ghana, is renowned for his meticulous performance monitoring systems that ensure the bank meets its strategic goals and maintains its competitive edge.


Conclusion

IMF commends Ghanas strong economic reforms as $360m aid boost arrives,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had just wrapped up their second review of Ghana’s US$3 billion, 36-month Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement. 


Approved back in May 2023, this review was a critical checkpoint for the country. 


The completion of this review meant an immediate disbursement of roughly $360 million, bringing Ghana’s total disbursements under the arrangement to about $1.6 billion.


In a meeting, Deputy Managing Director Kenji Okamura announced, “Ghana’s performance under its ECF-supported reform program has been generally strong.


 The authorities’ strategy aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and reducing debt vulnerabilities is paying off, with clear signs of stabilisation emerging.”




Ghana’s economic reform program had indeed been delivering on its objectives. After facing severe economic and financial pressures in 2022, the IMF-supported program provided a credible anchor for the government. 


It helped in adjusting macroeconomic policies and implementing reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability. The foundations for higher and more inclusive growth were being laid.


“These efforts are paying off,” Okamura noted. “Growth is proving more resilient than initially expected, inflation is declining at a faster pace, and both fiscal and external positions are improving.”


Despite some delays, Ghana has made significant progress on key structural reform milestones. The Ghanaian authorities were also moving forward with their comprehensive debt restructuring. 




On June 11, 2024, they reached an agreement with Ghana’s Official Creditor Committee (OCC) under the G20’s Common Framework on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), formalising an agreement in principle on debt treatment.


Kenji Okamura highlighted, “This agreement on a debt treatment, consistent with program parameters, provided the necessary financing assurances for the second review under the ECF Arrangement to be completed.”


Moreover, Ghana’s primary fiscal balance had improved by over 4 per cent of GDP last year. 


The authorities were committed to further advancing fiscal consolidation, aiming for primary fiscal surpluses of ½ per cent of GDP this year and 1½ per cent of GDP in 2025.




“These efforts are underpinned by reforms to bolster revenue mobilisation and streamline non-priority expenditures,” Okamura explained. 


“The authorities are also expanding social protection programs to mitigate the impact of fiscal adjustment on the most vulnerable.”


The Bank of Ghana (BoG) maintained a prudent monetary policy stance to sustain a rapid reduction in inflation and took steps to rebuild international reserves. 


They had also strengthened measures to preserve financial sector stability, ensuring the implementation of banks’ recapitalization plans. 




The Ministry of Finance had begun recapitalising state-owned banks in line with available resources.


“Ambitious structural reforms to create an environment more conducive to private sector investment, and to enhance governance and transparency are gaining prominence,” Okamura said. 


“These will be key to boosting the economy’s potential and underpin sustainable job creation.”


Looking ahead, sustaining macroeconomic policy adjustment and reforms was essential, especially during the upcoming electoral period. 




Kenji Okamura concluded, “Perseverance in macroeconomic policy adjustment and reforms is crucial to fully restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while fostering a sustainable increase in economic growth and poverty reduction.”


Ghana’s journey was far from over, but the progress made under the IMF-supported program was a testament to their determination and commitment to economic stability and growth.

Held in collaboration with the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), the workshop was aimed at empowering participants with a comprehensive understanding and the applicability of ESG principles in their business operations.  


The workshop, which was organised under the theme ""Unlocking Sustainable Manufacturing: A Roadmap to Effective ESG Implementation"", brought together industry stakeholders to discuss the growing importance of incorporating ESG practices within the manufacturing industry.


The event attracted over 200 participants from various sub-sectors within the manufacturing industry comprising pharmaceutical, food, beverage, wood, water, textiles, clothing, and machinery, among others.


The workshop provided a platform for industry experts to share insights and best practices on ESG implementation, highlighting its benefits for businesses, the environment, and society at large.




In her welcome remarks, the Country Risk Officer of Ecobank, Joana Mensah said; “Ecobank is committed to being a leader in sustainability across our entire business. We recognize the critical role that financial institutions play in driving positive environmental and social change. 


""This commitment is reflected in our numerous sustainability initiatives, including supporting renewable energy projects and energy-efficient manufacturing technologies, and partnering with selected NGOs to promote sustainable agricultural practices.


""It can also be seen in our investment in social impact projects that empower communities and promote financial inclusion, and implementing robust environmental and social risk management frameworks throughout our lending processes.”

On his part, Mr. Seth Twum-Akwaboah, CEO of AGI, applauded Ecobank for its long-standing support of the association and expressed his delight in learning about the Bank of Ghana’s requirement for commercial banks to evaluate ESG standards of companies as an additional parameter in business support decisions.

Bank of Ghana to issue climate risk directive to commercial banks,"The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has completed a draft document on climate risk assessment to be issued to the commercial banks operating in the country.


This directive is expected to guide banks and other deposit taking institutions on how to asses disaster and other climate risk factors during acquisition of loans. Director of Sustainability at the Supervision Department of the Bank of Ghana, Stephen Armah disclosed this during an interaction with Small and Medium Enterprise Businesses at the Absa SME clinic in commemoration of this year’s world MSME day under the theme; adopting ESG practices for business growth.


“This Directive sets out the supervisory expectations for stakeholders in relation to the approach to management and disclosure of climate-related financial risks


with a focus on corporate governance, internal control framework, assessment of adequacy of capital and liquidity, risk management process, management monitoring and reporting, comprehensive management of specific financial risks, scenario analysis and disclosures” he noted.


At the same event, interim Managing Director for Absa Bank, Adolph Kpegah assured SMEs that the bank will continue to provide such platforms as the SME clinic to support knowledge sharing on their business growth.




The event underscores the bank’s commitment to promoting sustainable business practices within the SME sector.


The clinic aimed to educate SME owners on the importance and benefits of integrating environmental, social and governance practices into their operations.


Bank of Ghana (BOG) recognizes that Regulated Financial Institutions (RFIs)


In Ghana are potentially exposed to climate-related financial risks regardless of their size, complexity or business model, and that climate-related financial risk drivers can translate into traditional financial risk categories including: credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks. According to the draft document,




RFIs shall therefore consider the potential impacts of climate-related risk drivers


On their individual business models and assess the financial materiality of these risks.


RFIs in Ghana are also expected to manage their climate-related financial risks in a manner that is proportional to the nature, scale and complexity of their activities and the overall level of risk that it is willing and able to accept.


The aim of this Directive is to enhance the management of climate-related financial risks by RFIs and, consequently, contribute to a more resilient financial system in Ghana that can effectively contribute to sustainable

GCB Bank PLC posts strong financial performance in 2023,"GCB Bank PLC has posted a remarkable financial performance during the 2023 financial year, indicating resilience following a robust post-DDEP recovery and also laying the foundation for a sustainable future.


The Bank reported a substantial profit before tax of GHS1,547.4 million, transitioning from a loss of GHS743.5 million in 2022. The performance is a demonstration of the strong earning capability of the Bank.


Commenting on the Bank’s performance, the Managing Director of GCB Bank PLC (GCB), Kofi Adomakoh,  said, “We reported our best-ever profit before tax of GHS1,547.4 million in our platinum anniversary year. Our strong rebound to profit after the adverse effect of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) in the prior year is testament to the successful implementation of our strategy and confidence and loyalty of our large and growing client base. 


""Our relentless focus on improving customer experience and commitment to make a positive impact to all our stakeholders will strengthen our competitive advantage, enable us deliver sustainable and improved returns and dominate the market.”


The Bank achieved strong revenue growth across its business segments, emphasizing its diversified business model amid market challenges. Total revenue for the period reached GHS3,784.2 million, marking a 26 percent increase from the previous period's revenue of GHS3,005.7 million. Net Interest Income (NII) reached GHS2,895.7 million, showcasing a substantial growth of 37 percent compared to the prior financial year. 




Net fees and commission income for the year increased by 14 percent to GHS438.2 million, compared to GHS385.0 million in 2022. Growth in client base combined with an intensified focus on transaction banking helped to improve net fees and commission income. However, net trading income dipped 13 percent from GHS487.2 million in 2022 to GHS425.1 million in 2023 due to lower trading volume.





In 2023, the Bank ended the year with operating expenses totaling GHS 1,814.7 million, indicating a year-on-year growth rate of 11 percent.


The impairment charge for the year decreased substantially by 79 percent settling at GHS 432.9 million in 2023 compared to GHS 2,74.1 million in 2022. The high impairment charge in the prior year reflects losses on government securities arising mainly from the DDEP.


The Bank's balance sheet improved significantly over the previous year, growing from GHS 21,494.4 million in 2022 to GHS 27,155.7 million in 2023, indicating an increase of 26 percent. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits by 23 percent to reach GHS 21,781.4 million, compared to the GHS 17,775.1 million recorded in 2022. Shareholders' funds rose from GHS 1,998.9 million in 2022 to GHS 3,080.1 million in 2023, reflecting a 54 percent increase.




In 2023, the Bank’s financial performance indicators showed a positive trend. The Bank recorded Earnings per share (EPS) of GHS 3.81, Return on Equity (ROE) of 40 percent and Return on Assets (ROA) of 4 percent. The cost-to-income ratio improved to 48 percent from 54 percent, indicating robust cost optimization and containment despite persistent inflationary pressures and exchange rate depreciation. Furthermore, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (with regulatory forbearance) stood at 19 percent, surpassing the regulatory limit of 10 percent and the prior year's figure of 18 percent.


The 2023 performance exhibits the Bank’s commitment to deliver on its brand promise, “Your Bank for Life”, through a strong focus on its strategic objectives of revenue growth and profitability, operational excellence and people and talent development.


During the year the Bank made significant progress in its efforts to drive revenue growth, improve profitability and grow its market share. The results for the year 2023 therefore benefitted from internal collaboration, enhanced relationship management and targeted marketing strategies. This helped to increase the customer base across all segments and transaction volumes.


The Bank also invested in a resilient IT infrastructure to support scale, security and reliability.




It additionally rolled out its Leadership Development Programme aimed at preparing employees for leadership roles. This was in line with the strategic objective of “People and Talent Development” which involved the cultivation of talent and nurturing of future leaders.


The Bank’s performance was further cemented by an expanded effort to support its communities and livelihoods with a key focus on youth, the environment, education and health. A total of GHS6.3 million was invested into projects and initiatives which support its social responsibility agenda. This brought benefits to millions of Ghanaians, guaranteeing them a better future.


GCB’s 2023 performance has certainly laid a solid foundation for a sustainable performance in the years ahead. This is evidenced by the impressive First Quarter 2024 results where the Bank posted GHS 411.6 million, marking a 37 percent increase compared to the prior year corresponding period.


The outlook of GCB is positive as conveyed by Mr. Adomakoh to shareholders at the 30th Annual General Meeting. 




He said “As I look to the future, I do so with a sense of optimism and confidence. Despite economic uncertainties and rapid technological disruption, GCB Bank is well positioned to advance further its market share and viability, leveraging its core strengths to effectively execute our strategy to achieve superior client experience, strong, sustainable and profitable business growth and operational excellence.


“We will continue to leverage our respected brand and strategic partnerships and invest to capitalize on emerging opportunities that will strengthen our competitive advantages in 2024 and the years ahead,” concluded Mr. Adomakoh.

Cedi to stabilise against dollar from July after debt restructuring deal  Dr Adu Sakordie,"Economist Dr Adu Owusu Sakodie has said he expects the cedi to make some gains from July this year following the conclusion of the debt restructuring deal with external creditors.


He is hopeful the local currency will respond favourably as the market receives the good news about Ghana concluding the debt deal.


“It often takes some time for this development to impact the market and that is why the cedi has not recovered strongly yet”, he said.





He explained that there is normally a lag period for the market to react to the news.


“I believe that in July 2024, we will be seeing some positives for the Ghana cedi when it comes to its performance against the dollar” he expressed optimism.  




He spoke on PM Express Business Edition with host George Wiafe on June 27, 2024.


Some analysts had attributed the recent depreciation of the cedi to delays in concluding the debt restructuring deal.


“We are expecting the local currency to recovery strongly, after the bondholders sign the agreement on the debt restructuring in the coming weeks”, he maintained.


Debt restructuring deal and the economy




Dr Sarkodie observed that the development will go a long way to help in the recovery of the Ghanaian economy.


“This is because we are expecting investors to also respond accordingly to this development and that could help deal with the confidence issues as well”, he said.


He is of the view that the deal will give government some fiscal space to help managers of the economy channel the country’s resources to other critical sectors of the economy.


Businesses and the Debt Restructuring Deal




Speaking on the same programme, the President of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GNCCI), Dr Clement Osei Amoako welcomed the progress made in restructuring the external debt.


“This will help to restore investor confidence in the economy, looking at what has happened over the past two years”.


“Businesses have struggled over the years, from high interest, soaring inflation and depreciation cedi, and not so favourable business environment”, he said


He described the development as a big relief for businesses, particularly manufacturers.




“We are also expecting the Ghana cedi to respond positively to this development, as we have already seen some marginal stability and we want that to continue”.


He, however wants Government to institute the structures that will aid fiscal prudence after the debt restructuring deal.


“We are worried about past developments, but we believe that government has learnt their lessons when it comes to the economy”.

Weve gone past the era of price controls  GNCCI President tells Trade Minister,"The President of the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GNCCI), Dr Clement Osei Amoako has appealed to the Minister of Trade and Industry, K.T Hammond to take a second look at plans to control cement pricing in the country.


“As a country, we have gone past the era of controlling prices. I don’t think that is the way to go”, Dr Amoako said on PM Express Business Edition with host, George Wiafe on June 27, 2024.


He argued that price control is an economic model that will not work in the cement manufacturing business.


“People have invested in their business, produced a commodity and you want to determine how much that commodity should be sold”, he quizzed.


He stressed that Ghana operates a free market system that allows market forces to determine prices and not the government.




“We have all come to accept now that, we are a free market economy and therefore let’s allow forces of demand and supply to determine prices”.





Background


Mr Hammond this week introduced a legislative Instrument to help prevent cement manufactures from exploiting the public. Under the proposed legislative instrument, cement manufactures could face up to three years in jail for failing to comply with this legislation. 


In May 2024, Mr Hammond instructed the Cement Manufacturing Development Committee (CMDC) to direct cement manufacturing companies in Ghana to immediately reverse the hike in prices.




However, the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) rejected the directive citing production costs and the principles of a free market economy, stating that the directive is ""without basis and justification.""


Impact of this move on the economy


Dr Amoako is however worried that the move by the Trade Minister may rather end up increasing prices on the market.


“There are a lot players on the market, and this could result in these players creating artificial shortage, and that could be worse than what the Trade Minister is trying to correct” he said.




“We should be careful how we go about this because it could backfire”, he warned.


Describing the Legislative Instrument as not business friendly, Dr Amoako said it is not the duty of government to regulate prices.


“Firms have invested so much in their businesses to produce goods and they are not being allowed to price right to make returns on their investments”.  


On the conclusion of the debt restructuring programme, Dr Amoako welcomed the progress made by government in reaching a deal with the creditors and Eurobond holders.  




“This will help to restore investor confidence in the economy, looking at what has happened over the past two years”.


“Businesses have struggled over the years, from high interest, soaring inflation and a depreciating cedi, and not so favourable business environment”, he said


He described the development as a big relief for businesses, particularly manufacturers.


“We are also expecting the Ghana cedi to respond positively to this development, as we have already seen some marginal stability and we want that to continue”.




He, however wants the government to institute the structures that will aid fiscal prudence after the debt restructuring deal.


“We are worried about past developments, but we believe that government has learnt its lessons when it comes to the economy”.  


The PM Express  programme


The programme looked at the impact of the debt restructuring deal and its effect on businesses and the economy at large.




Other panellists on the programme included  Partner at accounting firm, Deloitte, Yaw Lartey  and Economist Dr Adu Owusu Sarkodie.

Fuel prices to go up by 2.17 percent from July 1  COPEC predicts,"The Chamber for Petroleum Consumers (COPEC) has predicted a rise in fuel prices for the first pricing window of July 2024. 


This increase is expected to affect the retail prices of petrol, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at pumps across the country.


COPEC attributes the anticipated price hike to a further depreciation of the Cedi against the Dollar, with the exchange rate dropping from an average of $1:GH¢14.4788 to $1:GH¢15.2779, a decline of 1.89%. 


As a result, the retail price of petrol is projected to rise by 2.17 percent from the current average pump price of GH¢14.17 per litre to GH¢15.20 per litre.


Similarly, the mean retail pump price of diesel is expected to increase to GH¢15.21 per litre. The price of LPG is also projected to rise, with prices ranging between GH¢13.24 per kg and GH¢14.64 per kg.




In its projection, COPEC urged the government to reduce taxes on LPG or subsidise its price to encourage widespread use and accessibility, which would help protect the environment by reducing reliance on firewood. 


Additionally, COPEC appealed to the government to expedite efforts to bring the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) back into operation.

Addressing investment risk perception and realities of Africas extractive sector takes centre stage at AIRC Summit in Washington D.C.,"The Africa Investment Risk Compliance Summit being hosted by the EBII Group, a public benefit corporation, has been moved to July 22- 23, 2024.


The adjustment, according to CEO and President of EBII Group, Adjoa Adjei-Twum, is key to finding a multi-faceted approach in solving investment and trade challenges in Africa.


“ This change is strategic to not only ensure there are better collaborations and sustained efforts to change risks and compliance challenges for investors in Africa but also a unique opportunity to enhance the overall experience for participants, with enriched speaker sessions and greater networking opportunities”.


The AIRC Summit being hosted at 200 Massachusetts Ave NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20001 will put investment and trade risk perception and the reality of Africa at the centre stage in the context of Africa's critical role in supplying the minerals powering the global transition to clean energy.


“In the competitive global landscape, our mission is to forge and promote sustainable, mutually beneficial partnerships that prioritise compliance and risk management in a continent ripe with opportunities, yet complex in its diversity and challenges,"" says Adjoa Adjei-Twum.




Africa has consistently suffered from high risk perception and compliance challenges contributing to the continent's estimated $200 billion trade and investment financing gap.


With foreign direct investment flows to Africa falling by 3% in 2023, major stakeholders have called for dramatic measures to address these challenges as the continent is expected to play a key role in the global clean energy transition efforts.


Adjoa Adjei-Twum believes US Trade and Investment interest in Africa should be aligned with current investment opportunities on the continent, “We at EBII Group believes that with the strategic relations of US with Africa, investment and trade risk of the continent can change when the right controls frameworks are properly implemented across organisations and governments. It is crucial for African governments to ensure compliance in the regulatory environments, supply chains among others are implemented to meet international standards


of governance.”




She says current investment opportunities in Africa should be positioned as a sustainable corporate strategy for foreign investors, because investing in Africa has proven to be a good business, especially when all the necessary risks are addressed and mitigated.


The AIRC Summit offers a distinctive platform uniting key stakeholders from Africa and around the world to foster collaborative solutions to investment risks on the continent. It facilitates substantive dialogue, potential deal-making, and cross-border collaboration aimed at unlocking investments, while prioritizing innovative approaches to maintaining rigorous compliance standards in the extractive sector.


The theme for the 2024 AIRC Summit is ""Sustainable Resource Extraction in a Changing Climate: Compliance, Strategies, and Innovations.""


This year's high-level program will feature panel discussions, fireside chats and keynote addresses on topics including mapping Africa’s resource wealth, navigating regulatory frameworks, mitigating supply chain corruption risks, leveraging AI for compliance, and most importantly dissecting investment risk perception and the reality of Africa.

Banks remain in solid position despite challenging economic environment  Fitch Solutions,"Banks in Ghana remain in a solid position despite Ghana’s challenging economic environment and the ongoing efforts of the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), Fitch Solutions has stated in its new report dubbed “Ghana’s New CRRs To Have Muted Impact On Loan Growth And Weigh On Profits”.


According to the London-based firm, the banking sector has reported strong growth in balance sheet items despite unfavourable conditions.


It added that capital levels, which had fallen close to the minimum requirement, are beginning to improve again, and banks are recording robust profits.


However, it explained that the recently introduced linking of banks’ cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement to their loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) will have several unfavourable consequences. 


On March 25 2024, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) introduced a new regime aiming to boost lending and reduce excess local-currency liquidity to control inflation by linking the CRR to the LDR. “While we believe this will compel some banks to extend more credit, very poor loan quality will keep lending too risky for others, who will instead prefer to hold high cedi cash reserves at the central bank”, it stressed.




The table below shows the new requirements, which took effect at the end of April 204.





CRR to spur loan growth


Furthermore, Fitch Solutions said “We believe this new regime will support loan growth for some banks”.


Institutions with currently low ratios of non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans, will have room to increase their lending and, therefore, their LDR, which will boost industry credit growth in 2024. For instance, Zenith Bank, Access Bank, and GTBank – the seventh, eighth, and ninth largest banks in Ghana, respectively – recorded NPL ratios between 2-4% in quarter one 2024.




It said, this will allow them to increase lending, with an average LDR of 20.2% for the same period.


The growth will be supported by an improving economic environment characterised by interest rate cuts, falling inflation, and strong economic growth, which will boost credit demand. Additionally, these diminishing headwinds will make it easier for households and businesses to repay their debts, improving banks' loan quality and incentivising further credit extension.

Ghanas economy will not return to pre-pandemic average growth rate of 5.3% in 2025,"Ghana’s economy will not return to the five-year pre-Covid-19 pandemic average growth rate of 5.3% in 2025


According to Fitch Solutions, this is due to the International Monetary Fund-support programme which a new government will continue in 2025.


“We do not think economic growth will return to the five-year pre-pandemic average of 5.3% next year. After the December 2024 general election, we anticipate that the incoming government will resume fiscal consolidation in 2025, in line with Ghana’s Extended Credit Facility arrangement with the IMF”.


“This will likely involve broadening the tax base and reducing public spending, which will cap consumption growth. In addition, high import growth due to stronger consumer and business activity will weigh on net exports and limit real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2025”, it added. 


The London-based firm had projected a real GDP of 4.3% for Ghana in 2024, after a weak 2.9% in 2023. 




Data published by Ghana Statistical Service shows that real economic growth accelerated to 4.7% year-on-year in quarter one from 3.8% in quarter 4 2023—marking the fastest expansion in over two years.


Private consumption to stay strong


Fitch Solutions said private consumption will stay strong over the remaining quarters of the year. While inflation remained sticky in quarter one—averaging 24.2%— it expect that it will trend downwards and reach 19.5% by year-end.


This will alleviate some financial pressure on households and support consumer spending on goods and services. 




Fixed investment to continue recovery


Furthermore, it said fixed investment will also continue its recovery in the coming quarters, after a weak 2023. 


As a result of the Bank of Ghana’s 2021-23 monetary tightening cycle, during which it raised the benchmark policy rate by 1,550 basis points to 30.0%, real borrowing fell by an average of 26.1% last year.


While interest rates will remain significantly higher than before the BoG’s hiking cycle, it expects that lower inflation, progress regarding the restructuring of Ghana’s external debt, and IMF disbursements will gradually restore business confidence.




Infrastructure investment to be primary catalyst of fixed capital formation


It also expects that infrastructure investment will be the primary catalyst of gross fixed capital formation this year, with major projects like the Marine Drive Tourism development in Accra and the extension of the Kumasi-Paga railway set to boost activity in the construction sector.


In addition, the expected implementation of a progressive oil royalties regime will likely drive up capital investment in the hydrocarbons industry, particularly in the upstream exploration and production sectors. All told, we project fixed investment to expand by 8.7% this year, after a contraction of 28.3% in 2023, and add 1.2pp to headline economic growth.

Borrowers urged to promptly repay loans to safeguard Ghanas financial ecosystem,"A Senior at the Assurance Unit of Deloitte Ghana, Kwame Osei Bonsu, is cautioning businesses and  borrowers to promptly repay their loans acquired from banks or lenders.


According to him, this is necessary to safeguard the financial ecosystem in Ghana and ensure continuity.


Speaking on the Joy Business Masterclass on Joy FM, Kwame Osei Bonsu, said any delay in paying back loans not only affects the borrower’s credit history but prevents a lender from lending to other entities to ensure the continuity of their ventures.


“Paying back loans is very key because banks plan with your payment schedule anticipating the money because they know that some other businesses need this cash flow. And with your payment, they can fulfil that obligation”, he mentioned.


He also furthered that a delay in repaying loans without prior notice to the lender breeds mistrust and jeopardises a borrower’s chances of accessing any other credit facility going forward.




He also urged lenders to do their due diligence to ascertain the credit risk levels of individuals or businesses requesting for loans.


“If you have funds and you want to give out loans, you should be able to determine the specific risks that you are exposed to in order to take decisions that will benefit you and the economy”, he added.


Kwame Osei Bonsu also entreated lenders to hold borrowers accountable by calculating the expected risk associated with the borrowers and find alternative avenues to ensure prompt repayment of loans.

Tanzania Economic & Finance Stakeholders call for continental adoption of GEXIMs Tuesday market,"A team of Economic and Finance experts from the United Republic of Tanzania currently visiting the country have made a call on African leaders to consider emulating the popular Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) fair initiative by the Ghana Export – Import Bank (GEXIM) dubbed “GEXIM Tuesday Market”.


The four-member team comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Tanzania’s Central Bank, Bank of Tanzania, are in the country on a study tour of the Ministry of Finance and selected strategic government agencies to understudy their operations in the areas of Consumer Protection in the financial sector, SMEs and Microfinance.As part of their schedule, the team participated in a special edition of the GEXIM Tuesday Market dubbed “Tuesday Market Mid-Year Mart” which took place on Tuesday June 25, 2024 at the forecourt of the Bank’s head office, Africa Trade House in Accra. The team interacted with GEXIM’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer responsible for Banking, Rosemary Beryl Archer and some vendors at the fair.


Dionisia Mjema, Assistant Commissioner, Financial Sector Development Department of the Ministry of Finance, Tanzania and the leader of the team, reiterated that the continent needs to craft its own solutions to solve its problems and it starts with the promotion of a mindset of self-reliance.


Lauding GEXIM for introducing such a revolutionary initiative with the potential of changing the fortunes of the country and its citizens, she stated that “around the world, SMEs contribute to the industries for providing the required elasticity and have been identified as to play very important roles in creating private initiatives. Initiatives like the GEXIM Tuesday Market should be considered for replication across the continent to help in the continent’s industrialization agenda. And in countries where necessary, adapted in line with the market requirements and specifications”.





On her part, Rosemary Beryl Archer thanked the Tanzanian team for participating in the “Tuesday Market Mid-Year Mart '' and offering insightful ideas on replicating it across the continent. She highlighted GEXIM’s commitment to fulfilling its mandate to support the Government of Ghana in repositioning the Ghanaian economy into an export-led one.




“GEXIM is a Development Bank championing the Government of Ghana’s quest to transform the Ghanaian economy into an export-led one, and as per our commitment to achieving this, the Bank will continue to explore avenues to create awareness of Ghanaian products and create an external market for these products around the world. We are happy to work with global partners to harness the export potential of our Made-In-Ghana products by meeting international standards required for global markets”, she emphasised.


GEXIM Tuesday Market was initiated by the bank in 2019 as a platform for clients and producers of Made-In-Ghana products to showcase their products and serves as a one-stop-shop for the general public to purchase anything locally manufactured from well packaged and quality food items, cosmetic products, garments and textiles, leather products and many more at unbeatable prices.





In July 2022, GEXIM received the African Union Small and Medium Scale Enterprise (AU SME) award for ""The Best Market Initiative"" in the Africa category for its “GEXIM Tuesday Market” initiative at the first-ever African Union SME Forum held in Cairo, Egypt by the African Union in collaboration with the All Africa Association for Small and Medium Enterprises (AAASME).


At the thirty-first National Marketing Performance Awards of the Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana (CIMG) in November 2020, GEXIM received the CIMG President’s Special Award for the “GEXIM Tuesday Market” initiative.




In addition, stakeholders comprising players in the private sector, policy-makers and representatives from government agencies in the SME sector in January 2020 named “GEXIM Tuesday Market” as the Best SME Development Initiative.


Other members of the Tanzanian team were two economists from the Ministry of Finance; Ms. Zawadi Ngonde and Ms. Neema Mtei and Ms. Catherine Manase, from the Central Bank of Tanzania.

UKGCC raises funds for Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation with Hat & Flower Show,"The UK-Ghana Chamber of Commerce (UKGCC), a member-based trade association that promotes trade between Ghana and the United Kingdom, has hosted an inaugural, the Hat and Flower Show charity fundraiser, to raise funds to support the initiatives of the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation.


Executive Director of the UKGCC, Adjoba Kyiamah, remarked that “The Hat and Flower Show is a celebration of Ghana’s vibrant culture through floral design and millinery craftsmanship.  As a charity fundraiser, the event showcases the talent of skilled Ghanaian artisans while raising vital funds through our raffle sales”.


The Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation seeks to improve the lives of Ghanaians by implementing the ideals, values and visions of its patron, the Asantehene and the Asante Kingdom.


According to Ms. Kyiamah, the UKGCC selected the Foundation as beneficiaries because “their thematic areas, especially Entrepreneurship, which rallies partners in business and academia to promote Ghanaian entrepreneurship, resonates with our work in the UK and Ghana business community”.


She urged the public to donate to the Foundation, which has already impacted a million lives across Ghana.







The UKGCC has a storied history of raising funds for noble causes through its events.  In 2021 and 2022, it raised funds to support the establishment of a clinical trials unit at the University of Ghana Medical Centre through its Royal Ascot Ladies Day Experience event.


Nana Afua Kobi Prempeh, the Executive Director of the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation, expressed the excitement of the Otumfuo Foundation to partner the UKGCC to raise much needed funds and collaborate to undertake some of its core development initiatives in furtherance of the Asantehene’s vision of improving the quality of life of Asanteman and Ghana.


“Over the years, the Asantehene His Royal Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has implemented this vision through his Foundation partnering with like-minded organisations to enhance access to good quality education, real entrepreneurship and employment opportunities, and sustainable health infrastructure”, she said.





Through a fundraising initiative managed by IT Consortium’s CHANGO, a crowdfunding and group contributions platform, the event succeeded in raising funds to support the activities of the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation.




For his part, Mr.  Kofi Atta Kakra Kusi, the Deputy Director in Charge of Domestic Marketing at the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA), praised the UKGCC’s efforts at promoting Ghanaian culture with the Hat and Flower Show, and said the Authority is open to supporting individuals, groups, and organisations whose projects promote Ghana’s culture, heritage, and tourism.


“We are available for partnership and we are looking forward to working with any creative initiative and anything that has to do with our cultural heritage. We are there to give a helping hand to entrepreneurs that are doing something that has to do with our industry,” he said.


The show, intended to be an annual extravaganza, offered attendees which included artisans, fashion enthusiasts, and philanthropists, an enchanting experience.  It also provided florists and milliners with a dynamic platform to showcase their creativity against a backdrop of the rich cultural heritage of the Ashanti Kingdom.


The inaugural Hat and Flower Show, which was sponsored by Labadi Beach Hotel, Turkish Airlines, IT Consortium; Guinness Ghana Breweries PLC, and Standard Chartered Bank Ghana with cash donations from Contracta Construction UK, B5 Plus Foundation, and Vivo Energy, concluded on a high note with memorable highlights that included floral and millinery showpiece competitions.




UKGCC’s next Hat and Flower Show charity fundraiser is slated to occur on in June 2025.  Interested donors to the Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation may reach out to the UKGCC.

Yango and Guinness launch a nationwide Dont Drink and Drive Campaign with special focus on road safety in Ghana,"International ride-hailing service Yango has partnered with Guinness Ghana PLC to launch a new safety initiative aimed at preventing drunk driving accidents, promoting safe mobility and ensuring both drivers and passengers are safe at all times.


A continuous ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’ will include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers.


This includes in app notifications, regular training, out of home marketing campaigns and many advertisements.


The safety forum, which is a first step in the campaign covered topics such as recognizing signs of impairment, strategies for preventing drunk driving, and how to use alternative transportation options such as ride-hailing services like Yango.


The training was provided by certified instructors and was available to all Yango partner drivers and passengers free of charge.







This was attended by over 150 participants which cut across Yango’s partners, partner drivers, passengers and authorities from many safety organizations across the country.


As part of the ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’, Yango and Guinness organized a safety training to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence as well as highlight the many safety features Yango has provided for both partner drivers and passengers.


The ‘’Don’t Drink and Drive Campaign’’ will also include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers. This includes in app notifications, regular training, out of home marketing campaigns and many advertisements. Yango and Guinness are working together to create a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community


“We are committed to promoting responsible road practices and ensuring the safety of passengers and partner drivers. By partnering with Guinness Ghana PLC , we hope to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and provide the community with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe and responsible choices. We are excited to contribute our quota in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the country. Safety is a fundamental need and plays a key role in our vision to create income generating opportunities for partner drivers while providing affordable and convenient transportation for passengers” said  Ofonime Tom, Country Manager of Yango Ghana.




The Safety Forum also featured a panel discussion which had experts from the health and safety industry to speak on road ethics, crime, safety techniques and measures to ensure the safety and security of both the partner drivers and passengers. The panel consisted of Mr. Eric Komla Kwakuyi, Regional Safety & Security Officer at Yango, Lynessa Darko, Sustainability and Responsibility Manager at Guinness Ghana PLC and Mr. Damoah Emmanuel Nyarkoh, Director of Safety Campaign Ghana.


Lynessa Darko, Sustainability and Responsibility Manager at Guinness Ghana PLC expressed optimism about the campaign and safety training while encouraging more ride-hailing companies to follow the footsteps of Yango in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of their key stakeholders.


She said ‘’Safeguarding our community is very important in national development. Ensuring that as brands and companies, we play our roles in providing adequate safety education and awareness to help drivers and passengers stay alert on the roads while knowing the dangers of drunk driving is the first step to achieving a safe and sound environment viable for economic growth’’.


The beneficiary partner drivers received certificates of participation to confirm that they have successfully gone through the safety training and are fully aware of the many safety features provided by Yango for partner drivers such as display of passenger ratings, identity photo checks in special cases, display of alert zones and non-penalty configuration for drivers to be able to skip orders to the alert zones, display of passenger profile picture, rating form to evaluate riders and in-app calls to support.




The passengers who attended the training also expressed their gratitude to Yango and Guinness for putting together this initiative and pledged to use the knowledge acquired to ensure their safety and the safety of other road users. Some of the safety features available to passengers include rating form to evaluate trips, display of driver rating, safety center (this houses the share route, ambulance and police, trusted contacts and emergency situation buttons), SOS button, support team which acts promptly, drivers document checks among others.


This move is in line with Yango’s launch of the ‘’Safety Talk Series’’ last month which saw the company visit and educate students, faculty members and the general public at the University of Ghana during their SRC week celebrations. Yango and Guinness are working together to create a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community.

ASA students graduate and poised to impact the world with STEM,"African Science Academy (ASA) has held its 7th graduation ceremony honouring young women equipped with the skills and knowledge in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) to drive innovation and development across Africa and beyond.


The ceremony showcased the resilience and dedication of these young women hailing from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, Zambia and other African countries who, in the last ten months with resilience and determination have completed the globally recognised Cambridge International A-Levels in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Physics, all on full scholarships. The students also studied robotics and computer programming. During their speeches, the graduates articulated their readiness to apply their newly acquired skills and pledged to be good ambassadors of ASA.


In 2016, the Chair of African Gifted Foundation, Dr. Tom Ilube, founded ASA, an all-girls STEM-focused academy for gifted African girls from low-income backgrounds. The Founder of ASA, Dr. Tom Ilube, in his welcome address, emphasised the global impact of investing in African youth, expressing confidence in the graduates' capacity to drive change.


He said: “Do you know that it has been predicted that by 2050, Africa’s population will be 2.5 billion people, it will be a quarter of the world’s entire population. So whatever happens in Africa, impacts the entire world. If you have an impact here, it impacts the whole world.” Dr. Tom also emphasised that graduates of the African Science Academy will be creators of global technological trends and not predictors.





In her opening remarks to the graduation of the Class of 2024, the Headteacher of ASA, Gifty Ghansah, praised the graduates for their tenacity and highlighted the comprehensive skill set they developed over the 10-month journey. She urged them to challenge the status quo and strive for excellence, asserting, ""You have the power to make a significant impact.""




“The journey through this program has not just equipped you with technical knowledge and skills, but also, it has forced resilience, creativity, and a problem-solving mindset. These attributes are not only the foundation of your future careers but also crucial in addressing the global challenges we face today,” she noted. Touching on the uniqueness of the 2024 cohort, Ms. Ghansah highlighted perseverance, eagerness to learn and excel, and the can-do spirit, adding that the collective support among themselves “will remain a very beautiful memory with me.”


The British High Commissioner to Ghana, her Excellency Harriet Thompson, highlighted her admiration for ASA's students, noting their abilities as sources of optimism and hope for the future. “Every time I come here (ASA), I am inspired by you students. You are doing amazing things. I always leave ASA feeling optimistic. No matter what challenges have been on my mind through my day job or when I watch the news, I always leave ASA thinking it is okay. The world is in good hands because of ASA,” she remarked.





In his remarks, the Regional Director (Middle East and Africa) at Apple Inc., David Chisholm, shared insights from his career, urging the graduates to find joy in their work, build positive relationships, and maintain a balanced life. Additionally, he praised their sincerity and urgency in contributing to their community while reminding them of the significant responsibilities laid on them by their families, community and girls who will follow them through ASA.


Among the other dignitaries who graced the ceremony with their presence were the trustees of the African Gifted Foundation (AGF), the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Business and Financial Times (B&FT), Representatives from UN and UNFPA, Technip FMC, University of Warwick, Aya Data, alumnae of ASA, parents, among others.




Head and Deputy School Prefects, Emmaculate Wey Amu Adiba and Bernice Blanney Tetteh, expressed gratitude to Dr. IIube for the opportunity given them as well as Ms. Ghansah together with the ASA staff for their unwavering support.


“We are who we are today because of our founder Dr. Tom Ilube, who made it possible for this prestigious institution and hence these butterflies of change to come into existence. We owe our growth and membership as a part of this community to our dear headteacher Ms. Gifty Ghansah. We also thank every member of staff for all their advice,” she said. Highlighting the challenges, they prefects mentioned adapting to the new curriculum at ASA as one of them, which they eventually overcame with the support of their able teachers and fellow sisters.


As part of the ceremony, students received several awards with Precious Agyei from Ghana, receiving Best Student in A-Level Further Maths and Overall Best Student in Academics.

NTSB sanctions Boeing over release of 737 MAX investigation details,"U.S. investigators on Thursday sanctioned Boeing for revealing details of a probe into a 737 MAX mid-air blowout and said they would refer its conduct to the Justice Department, prompting the embattled planemaker to issue an apology.


The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing had ""blatantly violated"" its rules by providing ""non-public investigative information"" and speculating about possible causes of the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines (ALK.N), opens new tab door-plug emergency during a factory tour attended by dozens of journalists.


The decision sheds new light on strains between the crisis-hit planemaker and government agencies at a time when it is trying to avoid criminal charges being weighed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) ahead of a July 7 deadline.


""As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,"" the NTSB said.


The NTSB said Boeing would keep its status as a party to the investigation into the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines emergency but would no longer see information produced during its probe into the accident, which involved the mid-air blowout of a door plug with four missing bolts.




Unlike other parties, Boeing will now not be allowed to ask questions of other participants at a hearing on August 6-7.


""We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB’s role as the source of investigative information,"" Boeing said in a statement.


The NTSB's criticism revolves around comments made during a media briefing about quality improvements on Tuesday at the 737 factory near Seattle - widely seen as part of an exercise to showcase greater transparency ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.


During the briefing, which was held on Tuesday under an embargo allowing contents to be published on Thursday, an executive said the plug had been opened on the assembly line without the correct paperwork to fix a quality issue with surrounding rivets, and that missing bolts were not replaced.




The team that came in and closed the plug was not responsible for reinstalling the bolts, Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality, added.


The NTSB said that by providing investigative information and giving an analysis of information already released, Boeing had contravened its agreement with the agency.


""Boeing offered opinions and analysis on factors it suggested were causal to the accident,"" it added.


DOJ SCRUTINY


In May, the DOJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement with prosecutors that shielded it from criminal charges over interactions with the Federal Aviation Administration prior to MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.




U.S. prosecutors have recommended criminal charges be brought, Reuters reported on Sunday. The DOJ already has a separate criminal probe into the door-plug episode.


Thursday's rare exchange marks the latest sign of strains between Boeing and the NTSB.


In 2018, Boeing was widely criticised for issuing a statement appearing to question the performance of pilots in the first of two fatal crashes that led to a grounding of the MAX. Later investigations emphasised the role of flawed software.


In March this year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told a U.S. Senate hearing Boeing had failed to provide names of employees on its 737 MAX door team for two months, drawing criticism from lawmakers. Boeing then quickly provided the names.




On Thursday, the NTSB said Boeing had portrayed its investigation of the Alaska air incident to media as a search to locate the individual responsible for plug work.


""The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident, not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability,"" the agency said.


Asked during Tuesday's briefing who had failed to fill in documentation, Lund said: ""There may have been one or more than one employee. What I will say is the 'who' is absolutely in the responsibility of the NTSB. That investigation is still going on and I am going to not comment on that right now"".


The role of individuals is a particularly sensitive topic in air safety amid an increasing focus on litigation and, in some countries, a trend towards criminalising air accidents.




Under global rules, agencies carry out civil probes into air accidents for the sole purpose of finding the cause and making recommendations to improve safety in future. Such actions are separate from any judicial probes seeking to attribute blame.


Aviation experts say an 80-year-old international treaty that encourages people to speak freely and focus on causes rather than blame allowed the industry to cut the number of accidents dramatically since the start of the jet age, but depends on curbing any special pleading by the parties involved.


Critics, including some lawyers, say this system does not sufficiently take account of the need of the families of victims for detailed answers.


In 2013, the NTSB barred United Parcel Service (UPS.N), opens new tab and its pilots union from an investigation of a crash in Alabama that killed two UPS pilots.




In 2018, it removed Tesla as a party to an investigation into a fatal crash involving a vehicle's ""Autopilot"" system. Tesla hit back publicly, saying it had already decided to withdraw and accusing the NTSB of violating its own rules.

Let demand and supply dictate  Chamber of Commerce president opposes control of cement prices,"The Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry president says that government efforts to legislate the price of cement are not the way to go if the country is to develop.


“Demand and supply must equate for us to have a price in any liberalized economy, so when we talk about price control, it has a rippling effect,” Dr. Clement Osei Amoako said on PM Express Business Edition on Friday.


He continued, “The individual goes to borrow money at a very high rate, and then employ people to work with. Allow them to fix their price because we are in a competitive market where others operate. There is no monopoly when you look at the number of cement manufacturers.”


“There are about five or six companies, and each of them wants to maximize profits or make sure that their price is quite reasonable for them to have the demand.


“That is why they produce quality goods to compete, so you allow them to determine the price,” he stated.




He said when the economy is good and everything is going well, there is no need for government intervention.


“If you do that, they may even fold up due to the inability to meet operational costs. Where can we get cement to buy then? Are we going to import with our forex?” he quizzed.


Dr. Osei Amoako concluded, “It must be left open for them to compete among themselves. I don’t believe in price control.”





Background




In May 2024, the Minister for Trade and Industry, K.T. Hammond instructed the Cement Manufacturing Development Committee (CMDC) to direct cement manufacturing companies in Ghana to immediately reverse the hike in price increase.


However, the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) rejected this directive citing production costs and the principles of a free market economy, stating that the directive is ""without basis and justification"" and has refused to comply.


On June 25, the Trade Minister presented to Parliament an L.I dubbed 'The Ghana Standard Authority Pricing of Cement Regulations 2024' to gain legal backing. But he faced fierce opposition in Parliament.


The NDC MPs demanded that the legislative instrument (LI) go through pre-laying procedures before being formally laid on the floor.

You have 21 days to clarify under-reporting of remittances  Dr Atuahene to BoG,"Banking Consultant Dr Richmond Atuahene has given the Bank of Ghana 21 days to clarify the significant gap between its data on remittance inflows to Ghana and the figures tracked by the World Bank.


According to Dr Atuahene, the central bank has been under-reporting total receipts from remittances, allowing some FinTech and other payment platforms to withhold significant forex to the detriment of the state.


In the space of remittances, available data from the World Bank and the Bank of Ghana have contrasted each other. While the World Bank tracked a total of about $20.7 billion as remittances inflow to Ghana from 2018 to 2022, the Auditor General’s  reports on the Bank of Ghana’s consolidated statements of foreign exchange receipts and payments within the same period tracked and accounted for only $9.5 billion, leaving a gap of some $11.2 billion.





Responding to the Bank of Ghana’s rejoinder on FinTech and remittances, Dr Atuahene stated that the central bank was under-reporting cash flows from remittances. 


He demanded that the bank provide data within 21-days to explain why the World Bank figures are relatively higher than those captured in the Audited General's forex report.

“I’m giving them 21 days because I have more data and I’m going to reveal it, because you cannot challenge the World Bank data, which I have confirmed,” he lamented. 


“You are under-reporting, and this under-reporting comes because of the role of the FinTech,” Dr Atuahene stressed while speaking on the AM Show on the JoyNews channel on June 26, 2024.


Atuahene argued that the apex bank’s rejoinder was baseless and failed to address the widening gap between remittance receipts it captured and those reported by the World Bank.


“So I'm giving them 21 days, let them retract it and let them get the data and the facts right. Other than that, I'll continue to release the data and explain the data to the public,” he demanded.

Banks strong profitability sufficient to offset risks to capitalisation  Fitch,"The strong profitability of banks operating in Ghana is sufficient to offset risks to capitalisation from local-currency weakness, Fitch Ratings has pointed out.


According to the London-based firm, the sector’s pre-impairment operating profit was equivalent to 7.1% of average total assets in 2023 and should remain strong enough to absorb impairment charges due to pressured loan quality and the ongoing sovereign external debt restructuring, while continuing to support a recovery in capitalisation after the large losses inflicted by Ghana’s domestic debt exchange programme (DDEP).


“The Ghanaian cedi has depreciated by 18% [BoG data] against the US dollar in 2024, driven by a lower current account surplus due to increased import demand, a sharp decline in cocoa exports and energy sector payments, in addition to speculative activity and delays in external debt restructuring. Since end-2021, the cedi has depreciated by 59% against the dollar”, it said.


“The depreciation will add to pressure on Ghanaian borrowers already contending with the macroeconomic impact of the sovereign default in 2023, including high inflation (May 2024: 23.1%) and interest rates”, it furthered.


Additionally, the cedi depreciation has put pressure on the banking sector’s total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) through the inflation of foreign-currency (FC)-denominated risk-weighted assets.




However, Fitch said this has recently been more than offset by particularly strong profitability driven by high yields on treasury bills, with the sector CAR increasing to 15.5% at end-April 2024 from 13.9% at end-2023. 


Without formal regulatory forbearance, the sector CAR would have been 11.5%.


Banking sector capitalisation weakened by DDEPThe banking sector’s capitalisation was significantly weakened by the DDEP that concluded in 2023. The true capital impact has been masked by the use of a low discount rate to calculate the fair value of the new bonds received, and formal regulatory forbearance allowing DDEP-related losses to be phased into regulatory capital ratios over four years.Fitch said banks are far less affected by the ongoing sovereign external debt restructuring as their exposure to Ghana’s Eurobonds is limited, and they have already taken sizeable impairments.


However, the cedi depreciation has inflated banks’ exposure relative to capital, making capital moderately more sensitive to losses imposed on Eurobond creditors under the restructuring.

5% tax on plastics a good way of tackling plastic pollution  Kwame Ofori,"Environmental advocates are lauding the proposed five percent tax on locally manufactured plastic products, believing it will help address the issue of plastic pollution.


 The Founder of the African Youth Alliance for Chemicals and Waste, Kwame Ofori, supports the tax as a means to manage plastic waste.


However, he suggested a reduction in the tax rate. According to him, government must involve stakeholders, especially manufacturers, in deciding the tax percentage.


""I believe it is a good thing but one of the things we could talk about here is the reduction of the 5%,” he said.





Additionally, Eco-Conscious Coordinator Awula Serwah is advocating for a ban on single-use plastics, arguing that alternatives exist and urgent action is needed to combat plastic pollution. 




She believes that banning single-use plastics, like plastic bags, would be more effective than imposing a tax.


“Urgent action needs to be taken against the plastics menace. It is doing us so much damage…. Regarding the tax, it might perhaps be more helpful to have a ban on single-use plastics such as plastic bags, we don’t need them,” she said.





However, the proposed tax has sparked controversy among plastic manufacturers, who threaten to shut down their production plants for one week, sending over 30,000 workers home if the government does not halt the implementation. 


At a press conference, they accused the government of misusing the existing 10% environmental tax, intended for environmental protection but not utilised for plastic waste management and recycling.

President of the National Association of Sachet and Packaged Water Producers, Magnus Nunoo claims that the government has not used any of the 10% Environmental Excise Tax for its intended purpose. 


The President of the Ghana Plastic Manufacturers Association, Ebbo Botchway shared the same sentiment. 


""This fund was meant for plastic waste management and recycling activities, yet not a single cedi has been allocated for these purposes.""




""That money [1.97 billion Ghana cedis.] I am sure one-tenth of it will set up a lot of recycled initiatives and plants that would consume all our plastic wastes....""

Mr Nunoo further warned of a potential shortage of bottled and sachet water if the manufacturers proceed with their planned shutdown, urging the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) to stop harassing plastic manufacturers and calling on the Ministry of Finance to respond within a week to avoid the shutdown.

ADB MD lauds governments accelerated Financial Inclusion agenda,"The Managing Director of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) PLC, Alhassan Yakubu-Tali has emphasised the need to speed up financial inclusion through digitalisation. 


This, he said, will help bring financial services to people who don’t have access to banks.


He pointed out that people without bank accounts should be seen as potential customers. By developing a strong digital infrastructure, these people can be turned into regular customers.


Speaking at the Ghana Financial Inclusion Conference in Accra from June 26-27, themed “Accelerating Financial Inclusion in a Digital Era,” Alhaji Yakubu-Tali noted that despite Ghana’s progress in financial inclusion, more efforts are needed to enhance it through digital means.


“Just like roads and bridges connect people and markets, digitalisation connects individuals and those without bank access to the financial system, bridging a crucial gap,” he said.




Alhassan Yakubu-Tali, highlighted the relevance of the conference theme, noting that “digital innovation is fundamentally reshaping the financial landscape and creating unprecedented opportunities for sustainable inclusion and growth.”





He praised the progress Ghana has made in bringing many unbanked and underbanked individuals into the formal banking system. 


He credited this success to supportive policies and regulations, advancements in digital payment infrastructure, and partnerships between banks and Fintech companies.


Alhaji Yakubu-Tali commended the government and the Ministry of Finance for initiatives like the Digital Financial Services Policy (DFS) and Cash-lite Road Map. 




These initiatives have increased financial inclusion, improved the digitalization of financial institutions, and reinforced the government’s commitment to advancing financial inclusion.


He stated that the digital era offers a unique chance for banks and financial institutions to enhance financial inclusion by investing in digital infrastructure and enforcing policies and regulations.


Alhaji Yakubu-Tali mentioned that ADB has been a key player in the national financial inclusion agenda through its digital services, including mobile and internet banking, and contactless payments.


He also said that conferences like the 2024 Ghana Financial Inclusion Conference inspire financial institutions like ADB to use digital platforms to further the financial inclusion agenda.




The 2024 two-day Ghana Financial Inclusion Conference aims to discuss strategies to use technology to improve financial inclusion and to develop policies and regulations to promote financial inclusion. 


Banks and other financial institutions are key participants in the conference.

"Bill to regulate cement prices will be laid, passed before Parliament adjourns  Trade Minister","Trades and Industry Minister, KT Hammond, says he will disregard the petition from the Chamber of Cement Manufacturers to delay the implementation of a legislative instrument aimed at regulating cement prices. 


KT Hammond insists that the law is essential to prevent a cartel of manufacturers from exploiting the public. 


Under the proposed LI, cement manufacturers could face up to three years in jail for violations.

Despite opposition from the Minority in Parliament and various interest groups, the Minister remains resolute. 


Speaking to host of JoyNews' PM Express, Evans Mensah, the minister explained that he has made multiple attempts to engage the manufacturers in good faith, but to no avail, hence the decision to enforce the law to ensure fair pricing. 




""I intend to ignore the petition. I am working in the interest of the good people of Ghana and not in the interest of cement manufacturing companies,"" he added.


Mr. Kobina Tahir Hammond stressed that although the manufacturers were not consulted during the drafting of the L.I., he had consistently had conversations with them on the need to be transparent about pricing.


“I didn't have to consult them in drafting the L.I., I warned them consistently that they couldn't do what they’re doing [raising prices]. I consulted with them several times in my office, I told them what I wanted. I wanted them to be transparent, for there to be a reduction.


""I was told they said I couldn't do it. On a simple matter of price publication and self-regularisation, I have been going on and on…it gets to a point when something has to be done, and what has to be done for me within the law is to go to Parliament,” the Trade Minister said.

According to him, he is hopeful that the bill to regulate cement prices will be passed soon. He aims to lay the legislative instrument in Parliament and secure its passage before the current session expires.


""I have given the bill to my leader, the Majority Leader to get it laid and I expect that within 21 days it should become law.


""By Thursday or Friday it should be laid. I have a funny feeling that on this occasion they won't battle me because if you battle me on this, you are battling the good people of Ghana,"" he added.

Rotarians challenged to scale up efforts aimed at transforming citizens livelihoods,"Rotarians across the country have been urged to bring together businesses and professionals to provide humanitarian services and providing support in addressing challenges affecting the economy.

GNHDR report highlights pathways to sustainable jobs in Ghana,"The latest Ghana Human Development Report 2023 (GNHDR) reveals that Ghana's workforce is grappling with meaningful employment opportunities. Despite high economic growth over the past decade, the informal sector accounts for 75% of the workforce, and youth unemployment and underemployment remain a major challenge.


The findings from the report released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) indicate that young people aged 15–24 are disproportionately impacted by unemployment, with a significant 65% experiencing joblessness.


This trend has implications for the country's long-term and human development goals, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address youth unemployment and promote inclusive economic growth.


The report, themed “The Future Value of Work in Ghana: Pathways to Sustainable Jobs”, highlights the need for Ghana to bridge the gap between current opportunities and the future of work through strategic investment in both human capital and infrastructure to create a conducive environment for sustainable jobs for all.


“For Ghana to achieve its long-term development goals and reduce unemployment, it is crucial to invest in both building human capital and enhancing access to technology and digital infrastructure for all. This will create a conducive environment for sustainable job creation and economic growth, stated Angela Lusigi, UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.




The report emphasizes the interconnectedness of work and human development, calling for a reimagining of academic programs to include science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEM/STEAM) education and entrepreneurial training, preparing the youth for future job markets.


“The findings from the report provide crucial insights into the nexus between work and human development, urging stakeholders to adopt policies that foster inclusive growth and sustainable job creation”, Prof. Samuel Kobina Annim, the Government Statistician.


The report also recommends simplifying regulations and providing targeted training to formalize the informal sector, creating more stable job opportunities. Furthermore, efficient and reliable infrastructure in energy, transport, water, ICT, and housing is fundamental for the future of work.


“By investing in infrastructure and promoting entrepreneurship, Ghana can harness the potential of its youth and informal sector, driving socio-economic transformation and job creation”, noted Kodjo Esseim Mensah-Abrampa, Director-General, NDPC.




National consensus on long-term development plans is crucial for sustained progress. As Ghana approaches the end line for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 and its centenary of independence in 2057, the 2023 Ghana Human Development Report calls for a strategic focus on job creation, infrastructure investment, and educational reforms. By addressing these critical areas, Ghana can pave the way for a future where every citizen enjoys the benefits of decent work and improved living standards.


The report's findings and recommendations offer a roadmap for Ghana's socio-economic transformation, and its implementation will require the collective effort of all stakeholders, including the government, private sector, civil society, and individuals.

Ghana records $4.6bn in remittances in 2023; still in 2nd position in sub Saharan Africa,"A new report by the World Bank has revealed that Ghana was the second top recipient of remittances in sub Saharan Africa in 2023. In 2022, Ghana recorded $4.7 billion in remittances, occupying the second position in that year.


This was captured in the 2023 Migration and Development report released by bank on June 26, 2024.


According to the report, the largest recipients of remittances in the period under review in US dollar terms were Nigeria, followed by Ghana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe.


Nigeria received $19.5 billion, Ghana $4.6 billion, Kenya $4.2 billion and Zimbabwe $2.1 billion.


The report pointed out that remittances have become the most important foreign exchange earner in most countries in sub Saharan Africa.




“For example, for Kenya remittances are larger than the country’s key exports, including tourism, tea, coffee, and horticulture. Countries more dependent on receipts as a proportion of GDP include the Gambia, Lesotho, Comoros, Liberia, and Cabo Verde with remittances contributing more than a fifth of GDP in the first three countries”, it said.


The World Bank explained thatremittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa were nearly 1.5 times the size of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows in 2023, and relatively more stable.


Over all, the report said that the regional growth in remittances in 2023 was largely driven by strong remittance growth in Uganda (15 percent to $1.4 billion), Rwanda (9.3 percent to $0.5 billion), Kenya (2.6 percent to $4.2 billion), and Tanzania (4 percent to $0.7 billion). Remittances to Nigeria, accounting for around 35 percent of total remittance inflows to the region, decreased by 2.9 percent to $19.5 billion.


Remittance costs




The report revealed that sub-Saharan Africa remained the region with the highest remittance costs. Senders had to pay an average of 7.9 percent to send $200 to African countries during 2023Q4, compared with 7.4 percent in 2022Q4. 


Costs vary substantially across the region, ranging from 2.1–4.0 percent in the lowest-cost corridors to 18–36 percent in the highest.


Intraregional remittances costs are still very high. For example, sending $200 in remittances from Tanzania to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda cost a migrant more than 33 percent in 2023Q4.

                            Ghana performs creditably in 2024 IMD World Competitiveness Ranking",Joy Business,Banking | Economy,27 June 2024 7:52am,https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghana-records-4-6bn-in-remittances-in-2023-still-in-2nd-position-in-sub-saharan-africa/
Ghana places 2nd in remittances to Africa in 2023  World Bank,"Ghana placed 2nd in remittance flows to Africa in 2023, the World Bank has revealed in its 2024 Migration Development Report.


The country recorded $4.6 billion in remittance receipts in 2023.


Nigeria came 1st with remittance flows of $19.5 billion.


Kenya, Zimbabwe and Senegal came 3rd, 4th and 5th with inflows of $4.2 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion respectively.





According to the World Bank, remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa were nearly 1.5 times the size of Foreign Direct Inflows in 2023, and relatively more stable. FDI flows to the region reached $38.6 billion in 2023, driven primarily by greenfield project announcements in Kenya and Nigeria (UNCTAD 2024).




The World Bank said remittances have become the most important foreign exchange earner in several countries. For example, in Kenya remittances are larger than the country’s key exports, including tourism, tea, coffee, and horticulture.


Countries more dependent on receipts as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product include the Gambia, Lesotho, Comoros, Liberia, and Cabo Verde with remittances contributing more than a fifth of GDP in the first three countries.


The report added that regional growth in remittances in 2023 was largely driven by strong remittance growth in Uganda (15% to $1.4 billion), Rwanda (9.3% to $0.5 billion), Kenya (2.6% to $4.2 billion), and Tanzania (4% to $0.7 billion). Remittances to Nigeria, accounting for around 35 percent of total remittance inflows to the region, decreased by 2.9 percent to $19.5 billion.

Dept Housing Minister highlights key role of urbanisation and smart cities in sustainable development,"The Deputy Minister for Works and Housing, Dr Prince Hamid Armah has underscored the pivotal role of urbanisation and smart cities in driving Ghana's sustainable development. 


Addressing the audience at the Accra International Conference Centre on Wednesday, June 26, he highlighted the government's renewed commitment to inclusive and sustainable industrialisation.


Opening with greetings from the Minister of Works and Housing, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, he delved into the transformative potential of urbanisation, noting that approximately 58% of Ghana's population now resides in urban areas, with an urbanisation rate of 3.4% per year. 





While this trend presents opportunities for economic growth, it also poses significant challenges that require innovative solutions.


Dr. Armah passionately advocated for the development of smart cities as a key strategy to address these challenges. 




He explained that smart cities leverage technology, data, and innovation to enhance residents' quality of life, improve service efficiency, and promote sustainability. 


He highlighted the government's efforts in this direction, including the Digital Ghana Agenda, which aims to integrate technology into urban life, and the National Broadband Infrastructure Project, designed to provide high-speed internet access nationwide.


Sustainability, Dr Armah emphasised, is central to the smart city concept. 


He outlined various government initiatives aimed at promoting renewable energy, efficient waste management, and green building practices. 







Notably, the Ghana Renewable Energy Master Plan aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix, while the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan seeks to enhance public transportation and reduce traffic congestion.


Technological innovation was another key theme in Dr. Armah's address. 


He stressed the importance of fostering a culture of innovation and supporting tech startups, citing the establishment of the Ghana Innovation Hub as a critical step in nurturing technological entrepreneurship. 


This initiative, along with policies on digital literacy and STEM education, aims to build a workforce capable of sustaining Ghana's smart city ambitions.




Inclusivity was a recurring theme throughout Dr. Armah's speech. 


He emphasised that a truly smart city ensures that the benefits of urbanisation and technological advancements are accessible to all citizens, regardless of socio-economic status. 


The government's Affordable Housing Programme and the introduction of digital financial services were highlighted as key initiatives promoting inclusivity and financial inclusion.





In his concluding remarks, Dr Armah called for a collaborative effort between the government and the private sector to realise the vision of smart cities in Ghana. 




He underscored the importance of public-private partnerships in driving the smart city agenda and achieving sustainable development goals.


""Urbanisation and the development of smart cities present us with a unique opportunity to transform our urban landscapes and improve the quality of life for all Ghanaians,"" Dr Armah stated. 


""Together, we can build cities that are not only smart but also vibrant, sustainable, and inclusive, driving our nation towards a prosperous and equitable future.""


Dr Armah's address at the Ghana Industrialisation Week has set a visionary path for Ghana's urban and industrial future, inspiring all stakeholders to contribute towards a brighter tomorrow.




The 24th edition of the Ghana Industrialisation Week was under the theme: “Renaissance of Ghana’s Industrialisation; The Renewed Commitment Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Development, Produce, Add Value and Economic Diversification.”

Women in Business are critical players in propelling Africa to the next level  Absa SME Banking Director,"Absa Ghana’s Head of SME, Agency Banking, and Partnerships, Audrey Abakah, has called on women to share ideas and connect.


She believes that forging the right partnerships will help to build sustainable businesses across the continent. 


Ms Abakah made these remarks during the Absa Inspire Me Conference 2024 held in Nairobi, Kenya.


In 2021, Audrey Abakah led the process to conceptualise and implement the first Absa Inspire Me Conference in Ghana - an initiative aimed at supporting and empowering women-led SMEs. 


This year’s event took place in Kenya and attracted delegates from Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Mauritius, and Uganda, alongside representatives from ITC SheTrades Hubs across Africa and the UK.




A cross-section of delegates at Absa Inspire Me 2024


In her address, Audrey Abakah emphasised the transformative role of women in business: “At Absa, we believe that empowering women is not just about individual success. It is about societal transformation. It is about job creation and poverty alleviation. 


""That is why our Women’s Banking Proposition is uniquely designed to support women financially, strengthen their capacity, and create network and access to market platforms like the Inspire Me Conference.”


The conference’s key objectives focused on empowering women entrepreneurs to access new markets, providing networking opportunities, and creating a platform for direct contact with potential buyers and partners from across Africa and the UK. 


These goals were highlighted during various sessions featuring a mix of local and international business leaders.




For the 2024 conference, Absa Bank Ghana partnered with the Ghana Export Promotion Authority, Ghana Enterprise Agency, AngloGold Ashanti (Obuasi Mine), and the Organisation of Women in International Trade (OWIT). 


These partners played a pivotal role by sending 30 delegates from diverse industries such as Health & Beauty, Floral, Arts and Crafts, Confections, and Health to Nairobi. 


The collaboration aimed to equip these delegates to sustainably operate their businesses and connect them with prominent businesses in Kenya, facilitating potential partnerships and business deals.





The conference featured engaging sessions on topics such as accessing finance and sustainable economic development. 




It also featured inspiring addresses by Absa Ghana’s Interim Managing Director, Adolph Kpegah, and his Kenyan counterpart Abdi Mohamed, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Investments, Trade & Industry Rebecca Miano, Kenya’s President’s Advisor on Women’s Rights Hon. Harriet Chiggai, among other leaders and entrepreneurs.


The success of this year’s event sets a hopeful precedent for future conferences and ongoing support programs by Absa to nurture the potential of women entrepreneurs across Africa.


Audrey Abakah concluded, “Absa is unwavering in its commitment to supporting women in business by providing platforms like what you are witnessing this morning, bridging the gaps, and unlocking the boundless potential of women entrepreneurs across Africa.”

MPs laud Lands Minister for ratifying Ghana Bauxite Companys mining lease,"Parliament has unanimously ratified the Mining Lease granted by the government to the Ghana Bauxite Company to mine bauxite at Awaso in the Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai Municipality of the Western North Region. 


This was after a joint Parliamentary Committee of Mines and Energy and Lands and Forestry presented its report to the House on Wednesday, June 26, 2024.


The Awaso bauxite mine forms an integral part of government’s policy to build an integrated aluminium industry in Ghana.


The Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC), which was established to promote and develop an integrated aluminium industry in the country, has identified this mine as one of its four projects to build an integrated industry.


As part of its strategy, GIADEC is working with strategic investors to expand the mine and build a refinery solution to refine bauxite mined in the area.




Currently, the Ghana Bauxite Company, which has been in existence for over 80 years, is the only bauxite-producing company in Ghana.


The company has gone through different phases since it started operation in the 1940s.


Originally owned by the British Aluminium Company Ltd, the government acquired a 55% stake in the company in 1972, under the Mining Operations (Government Participation) Decree, 1972 (NRCD 132), passed pursuant to the National Redemption Council’s policy of “taking over the commanding heights of the economy.”


However, the company faced several challenges after this, with production decreasing from four hundred and seven thousand tonnes (407,000t) in 1974 to a paltry sixty-four thousand tonnes (64,000t) in 1982.




Government, therefore, decided to divest its interest in the company, and in 1997, Alcan, a Canadian company, acquired an 80% stake in the company, with government holding the remaining 20%. 


Rio Tinto, a British-Australian multinational, acquired Alcan’s interest in the company, before selling same to the Bosai Minerals Group in 2010.


In 2022, however, Ofori-Poku Company Limited (OPCL), a wholly owned Ghanaian company acquired the eighty-percent stake held by Bosai, making the company, for the first time in its eighty-year history, a wholly owned Ghanaian company.


OPCL was incorporated in 1990 and has enormous experience in the mining industry, having operated as a leading supplier of various mine services, including haulage, transport and provision of climate change solutions.




Following the expiration of its mining lease, the Company was granted a new lease on May 3, 2024, covering the Kanayerebo, Subri, Nchiniso, Afumba and Bokahirri Hills in Awaso. 


Earlier, this month, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Samuel A. Jinapor, laid the mining lease in Parliament for ratification, in accordance with article 268(1) of the 1992 Constitution, and the Speaker referred it to the Joint Committee of Mines and Energy and Lands and Forestry. 


Presenting the report of the Joint Committee to Parliament, the Chairman of the Mines and Energy Committee, Samuel Atta Akyea, said the request by the Minister for the mining lease to be ratified is in accord with the constitutional provision which ensures parliamentary oversight over the management and utilisation of the natural resources of the country. 


He said the mining lease was consistent with the Constitution and relevant laws of the country, and ratifying it will bring tremendous benefits to government and promote the socio-economic development of the area.




He said the Committee was, also, satisfied that the company has the financial and technical capacities to execute its obligations under the Lease, and, therefore, recommends the lease for ratification.


Members of the House praised the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources for bringing the lease to the House for ratification. 


They noted that the constitutional provision which requires Parliamentary ratification of mining leases has been violated by successive Governments since 1992. 


Members also congratulated the Minister and Government for securing a Ghanaian investor to invest in this strategic Mine, which makes the Mine wholly owned by Ghanaians. 




Members, again, lauded government for incorporating plans to build a refinery into the agreement to ensure value addition to the minerals mined.


They expressed optimism that these measures will inure to the benefit of Ghanaians.


On his part, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Hon. Samuel A. Jinapor, thanked the House and the members of the joint Committee for their diligence and for unanimously supporting the motion for the ratification of the mining lease. 


He said government was fully committed to indigenising the mining industry and is working with all stakeholders to ensure that Ghanaians participate fully across the full value chain of the mining industry.  




The ratification of the mining lease grants the company full rights to operate the mine, secure the employment of the hundreds of people who depend on the mine and contribute to the socio-economic development of the community and the country at large.

Steering through change: The role of interim leadership during CEO transitions,"The transition of a CEO marks a pivotal moment for any organisation. Such periods are often characterised by a significant leadership vacuum and accompanied by a sense of uncertainty. This period of change can challenge the very fabric of an organisation, testing its resilience and operational continuity. Interim leadership during this period plays a crucial role in ensuring stability, and operational continuity and preparing the organisation for its next horizon.


This article explores the crucial role that interim leadership plays in times of transition. It examines the difficulties and recommended approaches when taking on the role of an interim leader, while also setting the groundwork for the organisation’s future with new permanent leadership.


The Role of Interim Leadership


Ensuring Stability, Strategic and Execution Continuity


The primary responsibility of an interim CEO is to maintain stability and ensure that the organisation continues to operate smoothly during the transitional period. This critical role involves overseeing ongoing operations, maintaining employee morale, and managing stakeholder relationships to reassure all parties that the business remains in capable hands. Interim leaders act as a bridge during executive transitions, providing a steady hand that helps mitigate potential instability. They address immediate concerns, manage crises, and ensure that the company maintains its momentum.


Maintaining Strategic Focus


While the tenure of an interim leader is inherently temporary, it is essential that the organisation does not deviate from its strategic objectives. The interim leader must uphold and maintain the strategic direction, focusing on ensuring that ongoing projects and key strategic initiatives continue without disruption. They should also possess the flexibility to adapt strategies as the situation demands, aligning short-term actions with long-term goals.


Preparing for Transition to a Substantive CEO


The interim leader also lays the groundwork for a seamless transition to a substantive CEO, relaying key institutional knowledge and insights on contemporary issues. This preparation involves assessing the organisation’s current state and creating an environment conducive to identifying critical challenges and opportunities, which will facilitate a smooth transition. The proactive steps taken during this phase are crucial for the incoming CEO to inherit a stable and strategically aligned organization.




Challenges and Solutions in Interim Leadership


While the roles of interim leadership are clear and crucial for maintaining organizational stability and strategic focus, fulfilling these responsibilities is not without its challenges. Let us explore the common obstacles interim leaders encounter and the effective solutions to overcome these hurdles, ensuring a successful transition period.


Resistance to Change


One of the most significant challenges an interim leader may encounter is resistance from employees and stakeholders who may be wary of transitional leadership. To mitigate this, the interim CEO should engage in active listening, address concerns directly, and foster an inclusive environment. Building trust through transparency and regular communication helps align all parties with the interim leader’s objectives.


Maintaining Organizational Momentum


Maintaining momentum during a transition can be challenging, especially when critical projects need to continue without disruption. Interim leaders must prioritize key initiatives, ensuring that these projects do not stall. Regular updates and strategic focus sessions can help keep these initiatives on track and maintain the organization’s progress.


Balancing Continuity and Change


While it’s crucial to maintain continuity, interim leaders must also be open to necessary changes that may be required for the organization’s success. This balancing act requires nuanced judgment and a strategic approach to ensure stability while still adapting to evolving organizational needs.




Aligning with Board Expectations


Ensuring that decisions and actions align with the board’s expectations is critical. Regular meetings and strategic alignment sessions with the board can facilitate this, ensuring that the interim leadership’s actions are in sync with the organization’s long-term goals.


Best Practices for Effective Interim Leadership


Next, we will explore the key strategies that help maintain leadership effectiveness and organizational integrity during transitional periods.


Early Planning


Ideally, succession planning should begin well before a CEO’s departure. Proactive identification of potential interim leaders and preparing them for their roles can significantly smooth the transition process. Early planning allows the interim leader to familiarise themselves with the organisation’s strategic objectives and operational nuances, ensuring they are well-prepared to steer the ship during this transitional phase.


Clear Mandate


The interim CEO should clearly understand their responsibilities, authority, and the duration of their tenure. A well-defined mandate helps to avoid confusion and ensures that the interim leadership can act decisively and with focused authority. Establishing these boundaries and expectations upfront is critical to maintaining organisational alignment and efficacy.




Support Systems


To be effective, interim leadership must be heavily supported by robust systems, including access to necessary resources, critical information, and the cooperation of senior management. The backing of the previous CEO during the handing over process can also be crucial for the interim leader’s effectiveness. Ensuring that the interim CEO has these support systems in place facilitates their ability to manage the organisation confidently and competently.


Seamless Transition


The interim CEO plays a pivotal role in preparing for the seamless transition to a substantive CEO. This preparation may involve regular interactions with the board, joint meetings, shared briefings, and collaborative planning. Such efforts ensure that the incoming CEO can integrate smoothly and continue to drive the organisation forward without disruption.


Characteristics of an Effective Interim Leader


It is important to grasp the best practices outlined above for effective interim leadership. However, it is equally vital to develop the key qualities that set apart an effective interim CEO. Let us now look at the important qualities that help leaders thrive during times of transition.


Experienced and Adaptable


An effective interim CEO should have significant leadership experience and a proven ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Their ability to quickly grasp the organisation’s dynamics and make informed decisions is critical for navigating the transitional period successfully. This adaptability allows them to respond effectively to unexpected challenges and opportunities, maintaining the organisation’s stability and progress.




Strong Communicator


Clear, transparent, consistent, and effective communication is vital during a transition. The interim leader must keep all stakeholders informed, addressing any concerns promptly and providing reassurance. This includes managing communications with employees, shareholders, customers, and other external stakeholders to ensure that everyone remains aligned with the organisation’s current state and future direction.


Objective and Decisive


An interim leader should be impartial and objective, allowing them to make unbiased, timely decisions that are in the best interest of the organisation. Their decisiveness provides clear direction to the organisation during a potentially uncertain time and is crucial for keeping the organisation on track. The ability to make necessary decisions without hesitation supports the continuity of operations and strategic initiatives.


Interim leadership during a CEO transition is a critical component of organisational resilience. By selecting the right interim leader, planning meticulously, and ensuring robust support and communication, organisations can navigate this period smoothly, maintaining continuity and stability. An effective interim leader bridges the leadership vacuum and sets the stage for the substantive CEO to thrive and lead the organisation to new heights.


Ultimately, effective interim leadership does not merely fill a temporary gap; it enhances the organisation’s capacity for a smooth and successful transition. This leadership period is an opportunity to reinforce the organisation’s strategic directions, instil confidence among stakeholders, and ensure a robust framework for the incoming CEO, contributing to the overall health and growth of the organisation post-transition.

Ghana lacks indicators to assess economic turnaround  Banking consultant,"Banking consultant, Richmond Atuahene says Ghana lacks indicators to assess economic turnaround.


According to him, Ghana’s inflation level meets the international accounting standard classification for hyperinflation.


He explains that any country with an inflation rate exceeding twenty percent is considered to be experiencing hyperinflation.


Mr. Atuahene noted that assertions of decreasing inflation and economic turnaround are contradicted by Ghana's inflation rate being in the twenties, especially when compared to Togo's rate of 6.8%.


This follows President Akufo-Addo reassuring Ghanaians and the international community that the country's economy is on a strong recovery path.




During the presentation of credentials to nine newly appointed diplomats at the Jubilee House, the President highlighted significant economic strides and the resilience shown by Ghanaians in overcoming recent global adversities.


Speaking on the JoyNews' AM Show, Mr. Atuahene stated, ""Let them use their own definition of how the economy is turning around—a depreciation. I mean, I am not saying it from my end; Bloomberg has just said it is the worst currency in the whole of the subregion. Is that the way the economy turns around?”.


“If you go to the market, you really feel the inflation and the currency exchange, so when people say the economy has turned around because we as a country do not have our own indicators, this multilateral team would come here and tell you that your economy is turning around, and then they would take it.""


The banking consultant pointed out that Ghana lacks a structured methodology for managing its inflation and key performance indicators (KPIs), relying instead on input from multinational organizations to gauge the economy holistically without considering the actual situation on the ground.




He highlighted that discussions with businesspeople and ordinary Ghanaians reveal a consensus that the economy has not improved.


“In 2016, the inflation was about 15.1 and the currency was 4.1. Compare that, use the nominal rate, and you would find out inflation nowhere near where we were,” he noted.

BoG did no wrong in revoking license of UniCredit  Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court has in a unanimous decision reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and affirmed the decision of the High Court in the case of The Republic Versus the Bank of Ghana (BoG), Ex Parte Hoda Holdings Limited.


By this, the Supreme Court has affirmed that the Bank of Ghana committed no error in revoking the licence of UniCredit Ghana Limited.


The five-member panel, was chaired by the Chief Justice Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo acting as President of the court gave the ruling today June 26, 2024. The rest are Justice Mariama Owusu, Justice Prof. Henrietta Joy Abena Nyarko Mensa-Bonsu, Justice Ernest Yao Gaewu and Justice Yaw Darko Asare


Background


On 16th August 2019, The Bank of Ghana declared UniCredit Ghana (Unicredit) insolvent and revoked its licence to operate as a savings and loans company.




The Bank of Ghana had then argued that this was done under section 123 of the Banks and Specialised Deposit Taking Institutions Act of 2016 (Act 930).


HODA Holdings Limited, the majority shareholder of UniCredit, filed an application at the Human Rights Division of the High Court seeking a judicial review of the decision of the Bank of Ghana, to revoke UniCredit’s licence and an order of injunction restraining the Bank from interfering with the operations of UniCredit


High Court Ruling on the Case


The High Court presided over by Justice Gifty Agyei Addo, on March 18, 2021,  ruled in favour of the Bank of Ghana, and held that from the evidence before the Court, UniCredit was insolvent prior to the revocation of its licence.




The Court also in its ruling,   found that contrary to UniCredit’s claim of not being given a hearing, the Bank of Ghana served UniCredit with numerous notices


“Directing it to rectify its capital deficiency failing which the Bank of Ghana would exercise its powers under s.123 of Act 930.”


The Court further held that the Bank of Ghana committed no mistakes in revoking the license of Unicredit.


The High Court thus affirmed that the steps taken by the Bank of Ghana to revoke the licence of UniCredit and place it under receivership is in accordance with Act 930.




Appeal of the case by HODA Holdings


Hoda Holdings Ltd appealed to the Court of Appeal, following concerns with the decision of the high court.


 On 7th July 2022, the Court of Appeal comprising Justice Janapare A. Bartels-Kodwo, Justice Merley Wood and Justice G.S.Suurbaareh overturned the decision of the High Court and ruled in favour of Hoda Holdings Ltd.


The Court of Appeal held that the Bank of Ghana in revoking the licence of UniCredit under section 123 of Act 930 should have followed the steps provided in section 16(3&4) of Act 930. The Court of Appeal further held that the failure of the Bank of Ghana to comply with the procedure in section 16(3&4) of Act 930 meant that UniCredit was not given a hearing before its licence was revoked.




BoG’s Appeal to the Supreme Court 


The Bank of Ghana, which had some concerns with the decision of the Court of Appeal, also filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal. This has resulted in the new ruling by the highest court of the land on this particular case.

We want the right things to be done; were not interested in collapsing businesses  Registrar of Companies,"The Registrar of Companies, Jemima Oware has asked companies yet to file their annual returns to do so in order to be in good standing before June 30, 2024.


The Office of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) had earlier said some 508,000 businesses and companies in Ghana will be struck off the register for failing to comply with notices.


She stressed that the Office of the Registrar of Companies is not bent on just collapsing companies but wants businesses to comply with the rules and regulations


Speaking on the AM Show on the JoyNews Channel, Madam Oware advised entrepreneurs to always make the right steps to register their businesses.


""I am not that interested in collapsing but I am more interested in companies complying. You start your business and along the line some of them die and you relocate and when we later check the register and it’s the same location, it’s not right"".




""We just want them to update their information. We have informed all these companies to go to the website and check and if they are still interested to work with us. They are not taking us serious. The names are already on our website"", she said.


The ORC in a press release issued on Monday, June 3 said the affected firms have been served with notices and reminders through various sensitisation programmes and multiple publications for the past two years.


Initially, the Office of the Registrar of Companies gave the companies up to the end of 2023 but decided to extend the period to allow for intensive public education by the ORC and adequate preparation on the part of the defaulting businesses to enable them to comply with the directive.


It noted that Per Section 289 (5) of the Companies Act 2019 (Act 992), a company that has its name struck out from the register cannot and is not permitted to conduct business under the Company name for twelve years.”




Furthermore, the release warned that “a company struck off the register can only be restored by the Registrar of Companies after a court finds sufficient cause and therefore issues an Order to the Registrar of Companies directing the restoration of the name to the register as per Section 289 (7) of the Companies Act 992.”

"Over 30,000 jobs are at stake  Plastic Manufacturers warn govt over 5% tax","Over 30,000 workers in Ghana’s plastic manufacturing sector may face layoffs, and production plants could shut down if the Ministry of Finance proceeds with the planned implementation of a 5% tax on locally manufactured plastics.


That's according to the Ghana Plastic Manufacturers Association (GPMA).


Sachet and bottled water producers have also indicated they would be compelled to stop production for one week if the tax is enforced.


The Ghana Plastic Manufacturers Association (GPMA) has issued an ultimatum to the government, describing the tax as detrimental and regressive.


President of the Ghana Plastics Manufacturers Association (GPMA) Ebo Botchwey, warned that the tax would lead to increased prices for essential products such as medicines, beverages, and sachet water, which rely heavily on plastics for production and packaging.




“Let’s defer the implementation of this tax. The timing is not right, especially when businesses are already suffering from the effects of the exchange rate,” Mr Botchwey stated.


“We have been burdened with numerous taxes, and imposing another one now shows a disregard for the growth of businesses. Many companies are relocating from Ghana due to the high cost of doing business, and we are losing our competitiveness. Most imports now avoid the Tema port, opting for Eastern and Western corridors instead. What will be achieved by raising taxes and driving prices up?” he quizzed.


President of the Association of Sachet and Packaged Water Producers, Magnus Nunnoo echoed these concerns. He explained that they would be forced to shut down their production plants for a week, as it is not feasible to package water in paper.


“So our position on the 5% excise tax still stands as follows: That the implementation of the 5% excise tax on factory price of all locally manufactured plastic products and packaging will be suspended immediately and indefinitely,” Mr Nunoo declared.




“We need a comprehensive stakeholder consultation on any excise tax on locally manufactured plastic products. It is unfair to impose such a tax on items like plastic chairs, tables, buckets, household wares, water tanks, PVC pipes, plastic crates, paint gallons, industrial containers, lubricant and engine oil containers, biscuit wrappers, combs, and rice sacks. We appeal to Vice President Dr Bawumia to intervene, in this matter because the effect of these consumer taxes would really affect the masses, the common man, the common woman who suffer extreme hardship.""


He added, “We ask that GRA should stop the harassment of plastic manufacturers and we give the government, the Ministry of Finance one week to respond to our request or we shall have no other option than for all plastic manufacturers to shut down production for at least one week and, of course, we will send home over 30,000 workers, we sincerely pray to God that we don’t get to that stage.""


The President of the Ghana Union Traders Association, GUTA Joseph Obeng also highlighted the broader implications of the tax.


“If GPMA, the main body that supplies our packaging materials shuts down, what does it mean? There will be no bottled water, sachet water automatically, and we have to fall in line by default because we can’t package it in paper, we still have to package it plastic materials be it bottled water or sachet water.”

Bags of maize to be sold on weight basis to offer farmers value under PFJ 2,"The Ministry of Food and Agriculture is partnering with Integrity Commodities Limited to introduce a 50kilo weighing scale in the sale of maize to avoid shortchanging of farmers.


This is to prevent farmers from being deprived of the value of harvest on the market by traders who fail to buy produce at the right price per bag.


The standard weighing system was announced at the launch of phase two of the government’s Planting for Food and Jobs programme (PFJ 2.0) at Ejura Sekyedumasi in the Ashanti region.


The Ministry’s launch of PFJ 2.0 is expected to impact the lives of farmers and on the country’s food basket in general. Over 10,000 farmers have registered on the Ghana Agriculture and Agribusiness Platform (GhAAP).


Implementation of the PFJ phase two kicked off in three districts – Sekyere South, Ejura Sekyedumasi and Atebubu Amantin – with a stakeholder engagement to inform farmers of ready supply of all inputs.




The Municipal Chief Executive of Ejura Sekyedumasi, Dr Kingsley Osei says there are two big warehouses in the district for food preservation, which is expected to offer farmers ready markets.


Managing Director of Integrity Commodities Limited, Gideon Quaye, says under phase two of the planting for food and jobs programme, farmers will be provided seeds, fertilizers and other crop inputs to pay back during harvesting.


He noted the introduction of the weighing scale is geared towards promoting standardization in the agriculture value chain.


A 50kilo bag of maize is expected to be priced between 200 and 300 Ghana cedis.




Some of the farmers expressed gratitude for the 50 kilo weight standard for maize which they believe will improve their productivity and livelihoods.

The prosecutor told the court that between December 2022 and April 2024, the company failed to pay the social security contributions of its staff at the Takoradi office to the tune of GH¢4.126 million, an act which constituted an offence under the National Pensions Act, 2008 (ACT 766).


“Failing to pay social security contributions contrary to Section 83 (1)(d)(h) of the National Pensions Act, 2008 (ACT 766) as amended by Section 7 of the National Pensions (Amendment) ACT 2014 (ACT 883) is an offence,” the prosecution averred.




Ms Annan said the first accused, the Managing Director of Ghana Railways Corporation, and the second accused, the entity, which had its headquarters at the Takoradi Harbour, failed to satisfy that provision in the act.


Inspection


She said an inspection conducted by officers of the Trust on the second accused’s establishment revealed that as of April 2024, the second accused person had failed to pay the contributions.


SSNIT, the prosecutor said, served demand letters on the accused person and the company, requesting a meeting between the Trust and the management of the corporation to discuss terms of settlement of their indebtedness, to which they failed to show up.




“Officers of the Trust subsequently visited the premises of the Ghana Railways Corporation on two occasions in an attempt to engage the management of the corporation and also retrieve a part of their indebtedness,” she told the court.


Ms Annan, however, said all efforts made to ensure early and amicable settlement proved futile leading to the issuance of a criminal summons served on the first and second accused to appear in court.


She said the refusal to appear had led to the application of the bench warrant for his arrest. The case has been adjourned to July 8, this year.

Cyberattacks cost Israels economy $3bn in 2023 alone,"Israel lost 12 billion shekels equivalent to $3 billion to cyberattacks in 2023. That’s according to Director General of Israel National Cyber Directorate, Gaby Portnoy. Addressing a delegation of journalists from across the globe ahead of the Cyber Week celebration, Mr. Portnoy revealed that the country lost this much due to the War launched by Palestine on Israel.


According to him, cyberattacks have tripled since October 7, 2023 with the Computer Emergency Response Centre (CERT) receiving about 500 emergency calls per day from an average of 50 calls before the war.


Israel on October 7, 2023 was attacked by Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups in the Gaza strip. This is the fifth war of the Gaza-Israel conflict since 2008 which is part of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since the attack, 1,576 people have been killed and 120 people taken as hostages.


Gaby Portnoy said, “the war began with a hack into cameras, smart houses and billboards” which guided the opponent as this helped in accumulating information from delicate government intel to the least as a whatsapp group of mothers discussing the daily routine of their children.


However, Mr. Portnoy disclosed that “135 infrastructure of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas have been taken down” which were used to launch 1,992 attacks since the beginning of the war.




In his presentation to the journalists, he highlighted that the digital service, government and communication were the most targeted sectors. A further explanation indicated that the digital service had the highest attacks with a focus on the use of cyberterrorism, social media influence and artificial intelligence (AI) as the main medium used by cyber attackers to infiltrate Israel’s cyber space.


In tackling cyberattacks during the war, Mr. Portnoy outlined a three-layered approach which are; regulation, operation and education. According to him, “government has intensified policies that protect the cyberspace of state agencies, corporations and startups. Israel has equipped the Computer Emergency Response Centre to immediately attend to emergency calls and tapped into the military reserves when the war begun. Lastly, we have developed a great sense of awareness by educating everyone on sighting any form of attack and report it”.


Meanwhile, Gaby Portnoy stated that the war despite its disadvantages has taught the country three things, “constant change is a reality, cooperation and navigation”.


He believes the Israeli-Palestinian war is the beginning of a digital/information revolution as the current war is not limited to physical attacks or violence.




In another meeting with journalists, Head of the National Computer Emergency Response Centre at the Israel National Cyber Directorate, Dana Toren revealed that her outfit received 13,040 reports of cyberattacks in 2023. This was 43 percent higher than the number of attacks recorded in 2022.


According to her, “cyberattacks before October 7 were targeted at theft of information and after October 7 were cybercrimes targeted at inciting damage to Israel”.


In her over 20 years’ experience of developing a strong defense for Israel with specialisation in protecting the cyberspace of businesses, Dana Toren advised corporations to have a “strong business continuity plan” to help them recover from cyberattacks and to “learn from others” in order not to repeat the same mistakes or encounter the same problems.


The Cyber Week which is happening from 24th to 27th June, 2024 in Israel, is an annual international cybersecurity conference that offers a unique gathering of cybersecurity experts, industry leaders, startups, investors, academics, diplomats and government officials.

Finance Minister urges bondholders to accept terms reached in restructuring $13.1bn debt,"The Finance Minister Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam has asked bondholders to accept the terms reached on restructuring some $13.1 billion owed Eurobond holders.


According to him, Ghana will launch the consent solicitation in the coming weeks to implement the “agreement in principle reached for restructuring the $13.1 billion Eurobond debts”.


He disclosed this at the 11th Edition of Paris Forum which was held on the theme “For Successful Debt Treatment for Future Investment Summit” in France.





“We remain committed to engaging and resolving our non-bonded commercial indebtedness”, Dr. Amin Adam said.


Background




The committee of holders of Ghana’s Eurobonds on Monday June 24, 2024 announced that it has reached an agreement in principle with the government of Ghana on a restructuring of the Eurobond debts.


The Bondholders also agreed with government on some measures that will help provide significant cash flow and debt stock relief to support Ghana’s economic recovery in the context of the IMF-financed programme.


This comes after a similar deal was struck with bilateral creditors through the official creditor committee earlier this month on restructuring some $5.1 billion.





The agreement in principle term sheet revealed that the Bondholders could get a 37 percent “haircut” on their bonds.




Government is also proposing two options for the investors.


Holders having the right to choose  between the PAR and DISCO option, will have up to a limit of US$1,600m for the PAR option.


In case a consenting holder chooses the DISCO option, such consenting holder would receive 3 new instruments (Bond Short, Bond Long and Down Payment Bond). Otherwise, such consenting holder would receive a Par Bond.


Establishing Sinking Fund to build needed buffers




The Finance Minister also revealed in the meeting that “Ghana is, therefore, considering options for building buffers through a Sinking Fund to increase our debt service capacity in future”.


“We understand that sinking funds should not be debt carrying funds but should use the other routes such as in the case of Ghana”, he added.


Details on how Sinking Fund will be structured


The Finance Minister at the meeting revealed that the Sinking Fund could look at how excess funding from the Stabilization Fund of petroleum revenues could also be used. 





Improvement in the financial management of SOEs and rechanneling dividends into the Fund.


Budgetary allocation through increased revenue mobilization



Dr. Amin Adam noted that “Moving forward, securing financing solutions will be crucial to sustaining economic growth while maintaining fiscal stability”.


Restoring Investor Confidence post bondholders deal


The Finance Minister expressed government’s commitment to fiscal discipline and structural reforms, which he believes are key to re-establishing trust with creditors.


“Ghana also remains committed to implementing other measures to that will lead to maintaining credibility in these debt restructuring efforts”, he added.




The Finance Minister used the opportunity to also thank the bilateral and multilateral partners that had provided the financial assistance and facilitated the restructuring process.


The Finance Minister added   that “While Ghana achieved a comprehensive restructuring of its debt in record time, there are too many costly delays suffered by both debtor countries as well as creditors”


 Ghana’s economy post deal with bondholders


The Finance Minister was of the view that finalizing this deal “present fresh start positions Ghana as an attractive destination for foreign direct investment”




This he says “this development presents can yield mutually beneficial outcomes for both Ghana and our international partners, fostering sustainable economic growth and development”.


The Finance minister was also of the view that this landmark deal, with the bondholders “   demonstrates the confidence in our country's leadership and administration's ability to steer economic recovery, marking the first instance in recent memory where a debt restructuring has been both requested and concluded by the same administration”

We welcome Energy Ministrys directive on a single unified measurement system  CBOD,"The Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors' (CBOD) has welcomed the Ministry of Energy’s directive mandating all entities involved in revenue assurance measurements within the oil and gas sector to comply with the new standard.


This standard was primarily developed collaboratively by the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) with the Ministry of Trade and Industry and other stakeholders.


According to the CBOD, it believes that a single unified measurement system certified by the GSA is sufficient to ensure accurate and reliable data.


It emphasised the importance of a streamlined and well-regulated oil and gas sector.


It therefore advocated for a system where the private sector plays a more prominent role in managing specific aspects with the government maintaining an overarching regulatory framework and enforcing standards.




“The Chamber proposes a standardized approach, where meters mandated by the GSA could be installed by either the Depot, the National Petroleum Authority (NPA), or the Ghana Revenue Authority. The GSA would be responsible for the regular calibration of the meters. This system aligns with international best practices, where standard authorities handle meter calibration, eliminating the need for duplication by several entities, which comes at a cost to the consumer”, it said


“The role of the GSA in ensuring and maintaining standards is in the best interest of the state. All regulations within the sector should ultimately serve the national interest and be subject to state/regulatory oversight”, it added.


The Chamber acknowledged GRA's quest to ensure revenue assurance for government.


Nevertheless, it said any institution, whether private or public, mandated to undertake that on government's behalf, should do so in compliance with standards set by both the GSA and the Ministry of Trade Industry to ensure a transparent and efficient measurement system within the oil and gas sector




It welcomed initiatives by the Ministry of Energy to lead further dialogue with relevant stakeholders and to ensure a transparent and efficient measurement system within the oil and gas sector.

Ghanas economy to expand by 3.4% in 2024  IC Africa,"Research firm, IC Africa, is upbeat about the growth of the Ghanaian economy in 2024, saying, the economy will expand by about 3.4%, higher than the 2.9% growth rate in 2023.


This is however lower than the 4.3% UK-based Fitch Solutions is projecting.


According to the firm, the overall growth conditions and the outlook for key sectors, particularly the industrial activities, deepen its expectation for the start of modest economic recovery in 2024.


Its 2024 forecast range for overall real Gross Domestic Product GDP) growth is between 2.9% – 3.9%


“We tip the extractive sector to hold industry aloft with construction and manufacturing improvements adding further tailwind for industrial growth”, it disclosed in its commentary of the quarter one, 2024 Gross Domestic Product figures released by the Ghana Statistical Service.




“In the services sector, we expect ICT, trade, hospitality, finance & insurance activities, and transport & storage to support growth with election-related spending as a key catalyst”, it pointed out.


Ghana’s real sector showed green shoots of emerging recovery from the 2023 trough with a stronger overall growth momentum in the first quarter of 2024 consistent with the full year 2024 growth outlook.


Overall real GDP expanded by 4.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024, outpacing the 3.1% outturn in the same period of 2023 and representing the highest quarterly growth since the second quarter of 2022.


The overall growth recovery was powered by a rebound within the industrial sector, which expanded by 6.8% year-on-year as improved activity in key sub-sectors benefited from favourable base effect. However, a moderation in growth in the agriculture (4.1% year-on-year) and services sectors (3.3%) indicates the lingering fragility within the real sector which was emphasised by the slower growth rate in non-oil real GDP at 4.2% year-on-year Q1 2024.




The moderation in services sector growth reflects contractions in fiscal-dependent sectors as the International Monetary Fund induced fiscal restraint triggered a normalisation in public sector activity following the increased recruitment and higher remunerations in Q12023 prior to the IMF programme.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.
