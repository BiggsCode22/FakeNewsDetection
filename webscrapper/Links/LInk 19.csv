"IMF: Ghana has fulfilled obligations, awaiting creditor action on debt restructuring","The Director of the African Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Abebe Aemro Selassie, has confirmed that Ghana has taken the required steps to secure the long-awaited financing assurance from its external creditors.
He added that the IMF is patiently awaiting responses from bilateral creditors.
“I have to tell you that whereas it took something like nine months or more for Zambia to get the official creditor committee to be created, in Ghana’s case, it was fairly rapid…Ghana has done its fair share and it’s for the creditors to take steps,” Mr. Selassie said when addressing journalists following the publication of Africa’s Regional Outlook Report during the Annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco.



He added “We’re not going to be asking the government to do more adjustment because creditors haven’t asked either. We will provide all the information necessary, so creditors can move, allowing us to go to the Board as soon as possible.”
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta earlier disclosed that Ghana had secured assurances from both China and France regarding the Memorandum of Outstanding (MoU) for the restructuring of the country’s external bilateral debts.
“We have met the Central Bank Governor of China and we don’t perceive any opposition or reluctance in participating positively when it comes to the Memorandum of Understanding on restructuring of our external bilateral debts” the finance minister said.
Responding to inquiries from journalists at the Annual International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr Ofori-Atta added, “The Chinese government within the past months is close to reaching a similar deal with Zambia, Sri Lanka and Suriname, so following that trend, we expect some similar cooperation from them when it comes to Ghana”.
Mr Ofori-Atta in an earlier interview described the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings as an opportunity for a new beginning for the global financial architecture.
In his remarks at a Roundtable Discussion on “IMF Policy Priorities,” Mr Ofori-Atta charged the IMF to strengthen the global financial safety net through bold reforms to the global financial architecture.
During the Roundtable hosted by US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Mr Ofori-Atta praised the transformative leadership of IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, which has led to the achievement of truly momentous things.
He however continued, “We need to stretch the IMF to do more. The need is great. And at these Annual Meetings, the developing world is asking the international community to do all it can to advance a reform agenda that ensures institutions like the IMF have the requisite mandates, financing, and governance models to deliver transformative impact.”",citibusinessnews,"Featured, Local Economy","October 16, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-ghana-has-fulfilled-obligations-awaiting-creditor-action-on-debt-restructuring/
"IMF, World Bank work to accelerate debt treatment for Ghana, others under G20","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are working together to accelerate debt restructuring for Ghana and other countries under the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework.
Ms Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF said this during a plenary meeting at the 2023 IMF/WGB Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“The IMF and the World Bank are bringing all relevant creditors and debtors together with promising signs,” the IMF Managing Director said.



She explained that the two global financial institutions were doing so because the progress of the Common Framework on delivering on debt restructurings had been slow. The move is one of the supporting-pillars of the two-thronged “no regrets” actions for the next fifty years, captured in the Marrakech Principles, aimed at closing the divergent global income gap and generate job-rich growth for all.
The two policy actions are – investment in strong economic foundations, and investment in global cooperation.
More than half of low-income countries remained in or were at risk of debt distress, with about half of emerging economies facing default-like debt spreads. That, Ms Georgieva, said required prompt delivery of debt treatment, which would be beneficial to both creditors and debtors.
On the Fund’s support beyond pushing for speedy debt negotiations, she said, about US$1 trillion in liquidity and financing had been provided to countries across the world since the
“This came via the US$650bn Special Drawing Right (SDR) and US$320bn in lending to 96 countries, including 56 low-income nations,” she said.
“Our meetings here in Marrakech, the Red, leave me in no doubt that, together, we will unlock the door to opportunities for the next generation,” the IMF Managing Director said.
“Debt has increased throughout emerging markets – doubling in Africa – shackling
countries to the ground just as they’re trying to rise, Mr Banga, the World Bank President
noted.
He said it had become important to reimagine partnerships and have innovative plans to address the debt and other economic and climate change challenges for a liveable planet.
“We took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing US$40bn over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio,” the World Bank President said.
He added that the Bank had also created a portfolio guarantee mechanism, together with the launch of a hybrid capital instrument to enable it take risks and boost its lending capacity, the more.
“Taken together, we could provide US$157bn more in lending over a decade,” Mr Banga
said.
Immediate steps were taken to lessen the debt burden of low-income countries after the COVID-19 pandemic, where countries called on the IMF and World Bank to lend their support to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).
This was after a decision by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting to endorse the suspension of debt service of most vulnerable countries of under the Group.
Further action was taken later on in 2020 by the G20 Finance Ministers in endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI to facilitate the timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries.
Since then, Ghana, Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia have requested for debt restructuring, and
are at various stages of deals with Official Creditors.
Ghana, for example, looks forward to signing a pact with external creditors for a second tranche of US$600m from IMF, Zambia reached an agreement on Saturday, October 14, 2023, and awaiting official signing of agreement.

Zambia advises Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation,"Mr Situmbeko Musokotwane, Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zambia, has advised Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation.
“We put a law in Parliament which tied my hands to say, going forward, you can’t be like those in the past. So, we tied our hands for Parliament to have more power and restrictions on borrowing,” he said.
That should be combined with reforms to maintain credibility with creditors, international community, and citizens, as well as create a conducive environment for private sector investment for value addition.



He expressed confidence that such action would hasten the processes of concluding debt treatment, grow the
economy, increase domestic revenue, create more jobs and uplift the living standards of people, and help avoid future debt crisis.
Minister Musokotwane said this as he shared the experience of Zambian authorities, who on Saturday, October 14, 2023, formalised on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with its Official Creditors on restructuring of some US$6.3 billion debt.
Zambia, the first African country to default on its debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, reached an agreement in
principle in June, and currently awaiting to sign an MoU for the restructuring of its debt.
He spoke at the African Finance Ministers press briefing on Saturday, October 14, 2023, in Marrakech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG) Annual Meetings.
He explained that it was important for the country to take prudent measures not to accumulate high debts by having strong structural and sustainable reforms, while investing in education, healthcare, infrastructure and industrialisation.
“To get the support of the international community – lenders and other people, obviously, must conclude that you’re worthy of their support, and willing to take steps to assist yourself,” he noted.
“We’ve learnt a lot, and for people like you [Ghana], you’ve been lucky,” Mr Musokotwane said, with respect to Ghana gaining external creditors assurance and securing an IMF programme in five months.
Among others, Ghana has a Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2018 (Act 982), which requires government not to spend beyond a threshold that would push fiscal deficit above five per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
However, it was suspended in 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the government envisaged that it would not meet the five per cent deficit threshold.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance and B Bank of Ghana (BoG) have signed an MoU, providing for zero monetary financing throughout the IMF US$3 billion loan-support programme with Ghana.
Meanwhile, Ghana’s economic growth had averaged 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters of 2023, something that Dr. Ernest Addison, Governor, BoG, explained, should make government “operate without access to central bank financing.”

"2024 budget: Government commits to more expenditure cuts, aggressive growth, jobs","The government has assured Ghanaians that it will safeguard current economic gains, and make it reflect in the living conditions of everyone in the coming months.
To this end, there would be more expenditure reduction measures in the 2024 budget, as well as policies to consolidate macroeconomic gains, ensuring that inflation and exchange rate are tamed.
Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Finance Minister and Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, Information Minister, gave the
assurances on Friday evening ahead of the budget presentation in November.



They spoke on the sidelines of the 2023 International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG)
Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“You’ll see more prudent fiscal measures in the 2024 budget to keep the macroeconomy stable so that inflation continues to go down and the currency remains stable. That’s an assurance from government that will surely happen” Mr Ofori-Atta said.
“We’ll also find various incentives and resources into the growth agenda that we have to catalyse the
private sector to thrive,” the Minister pledged during a press briefing.
The government introduced a number of cost-cutting measures in the 2023 budget, including, a freeze on
employment in the public sector, reduction in salaries of some government officials, aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability.
In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Nkrumah said those measures had started yielding
positive results, but the government would do more, which would be specified in the 2024 budget.
“Although we don’t have the final figures, one of the clearest ways to examine the performance of the measures to reduce expenditure is to look at the primary balance, and there’s a clear indication that we’re doing well to stay within the revenue envelope that we have,” he said.
Ghana’s primary balance – the difference between the amount of revenue the government collects and
spends on providing public goods and services, excluding debt payment, was −1.3 as of the first half of
2022, but stood at 0.6 the same period, 2023.
Reiterating government’s commitment to fiscal discipline, Mr Nkrumah said: “Going forward, our focus is
to stay on that path to ensure that we don’t blow the fiscals out of gear.”
Some Civil Society Groups, Economists and Governance experts in the country have been calling for a
reduction in the number of ministers and government officials as part of measure to maintain fiscal
discipline, but that is yet to happen.
They have also encouraged the government to be more aggressive on collecting property taxes, incentivize to rope the informal sector into the tax net, and reduce the rate of the Electronic Transactions Levy (E-levy) to about 0.5 per cent from the one per cent.
That they expressed confidence in increasing domestic revenue to support expenditure reduction measures, making the economy more robust.

With a relentless commitment to serving its customers better, the Bank has consistently led the way in redefining banking in Ghana through innovative solutions. One significant milestone in Zenith’s innovation journey was its pioneering venture into online banking, revolutionizing the way customers managed their finances.

The Bank continues to deepen its engagement with customers and its accessibility to them through initiatives such as its 24hour Customer Contact Centre, Zenith Direct, which features channels such as Z-Chat (an online live chat platform), the Complaints Portal, Voice Calls, and Email – where customers can seek information about products and services, provide service feedback to the Bank, or report complaints. The Bank’s unwavering commitment to a customer-centric approach, characterized by open communication and support for clients during difficult times has fostered trust and loyalty.

In commemoration of the 18th Anniversary celebration, Zenith Bank Ghana organised a prayer and thanksgiving service to thank the Almighty God for 18 successful years of Banking operations in Ghana.

A key highlight of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary celebration was the Bank’s presentation of a cheque of GHS150,000 to the Pediatric Oncology Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).  The presentation, which was in furtherance of the Bank’s CSR objective of giving back to the society in which it operates was in response to an appeal by Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG), a non-governmental organization dedicated to making childhood cancer a national health priority whilst facilitating and increasing access to optimal medical care and treatment for children with cancer.
Speaking at the presentation, the MD/CEO stated that, “When Akua Sarpong, the Co-founder and Executive Directive of Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG) spoke with our colleagues about the cause she is championing, we saw that it is one that needed some form of assistance especially from corporate institutions, and we readily and willingly supported this very worthy cause as September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month globally as well as the month of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary”.
Speaking on behalf of LCCG and the Oncology Unit, Prof. Lorna Reinner, Pediatric Oncologist at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital who spoke on behalf of the Pediatric Oncology Unit expressed appreciation to Zenith Bank for the very kind gesture. She indicated that the LCCG and the hospital are currently working towards the expansion of the pediatric oncology block to increase the current facility’s capacity to include a 40-bed children’s ward to enable the hospital improve treatment and care for patients; as such the Bank’s donation which was apt and timely and would go towards the construction of the new ward.
Prof. Reinner thus noted that increased support from other corporate institutions would greatly help the unit improve treatment outcomes for children with cancer and their families given the needed support.
Prior to the presentation at the Pediatric Oncology Units, earlier in the week, the Bank organised a Virtual Health Talk for staff on “Childhood Cancer –to create awareness of Childhood cancer and to educate staff on the signs, symptoms, preventive measures and treatment options available for patients.
Also, during the anniversary celebration, the Bank organised a two-week EazyBanking activation exercise at all 40 business locations nationwide to sign customers on to the Bank’s digital banking products such as Internet Banking, Zenith Mobile Banking App (ZMobile), Cards, Point of Sale Terminals, Scan To Pay, etc).

For every customer that signed up for a product, they received an instant gift from the Bank to the delight of many.
The Bank’s online audience was not left out of the celebration as followers of the Bank’s social media pages also enjoyed fun and interactive games and rewards that kept them glued to the pages.
To climax the celebration, the Bank organised a TGIF/Karaoke Night across all branches to appreciate staff for their hard work, loyalty and commitment to the success of the Bank.

Former Capital Bank CEO Ato Essien jailed 15 years,"Former Chief Executive Officer of defunct Capital Bank, Ato Essien has been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with hard labour.
This follows his failure to pay in full an amount of GH¢90 million he agreed to pay the state despite several lifelines given him since December 2022.
Ato Essien pleaded guilty to 16 counts of stealing, money laundering and conspiracy to steal for his role in the collapse of Capital Bank.



He however entered a plea bargain with the state under section 35(7) of the courts ACT 459.
Under the agreement, Mr. Essien was expected to pay GH¢90 million for which he paid GH¢30 million cedis on December 13.
He was to pay the GH¢60 million remainder in three equal instalments in 2023; GH¢20 million by April 28, another GH¢20 million by August 31 and the last GH¢20 million by December 15, 2023.
A major condition of the agreement was that the court would not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence if he missed any of the payment deadlines.
But as of April 28, Mr. Essien had not paid all the GH¢20 million due to be settled.
The state filed an application on May 2, 2023, to get a custodial sentence imposed on the convict (Ato Essien).
But that application was not heard as the presiding judge, Justice Eric Kyei Baffour gave him (Ato Essien) about six months to redeem himself.
But between January this year to October 12, Ato Essien has only paid GH¢7 million in addition to the GH¢30 million previously paid.
With GH¢53 million of the agreed sum outstanding, the judge having exhausted his patience allowed the state to move the application.
The judge upon hearing the application jailed Ato Essien to spend 15 years in prison.",citibusinessnews,"Bankg And Fance, Featured","October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/former-capital-bank-ceo-ato-essien-jailed-15-years/
IMF clarifies Ghanas growth rate projection,"The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Resident Representative in Ghana, Dr. Leandro Medina, has clarified that the growth rate for the country has not been revised to 1.2% from the May 2023 forecast of 1.5%.
Dr. Medina explained that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection of 1.2% growth for 2023 is based on an old set of projections that do not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2% for the first two quarters).
He added that based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, the IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5% previously assumed.



Various media portals reported that the IMF had lowered Ghana’s growth rate to 1.2% making it the second time the Fund had revised Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for 2023.
But Dr Medina in a statement clarifying the issue said “The latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection (1.2 per cent growth for 2023) is based on an old vintage of Fund staff projections. In particular, it does not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters).
“At the current juncture, and based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5 percent previously assumed.”

Stéphane Roudet, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Mission Chief to Ghana in an interview on the Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, October 9 also lauded Ghana’s economic growth.
Mr Roudet intimated that Ghana’s quick economic recovery is surprising and also encouraging, as the country has outperformed the IMF’s projection for the year 2023.
He indicated that the IMF had projected Ghana’s economy to grow at a rate of 1.5 percent by the year ending 2023, but the first-half report shows that the country’s economy is growing at a rate of 3 percent, which he said is very encouraging and will go a long way to ensuring the smooth disbursement of the second tranche of the $3 billion credit facility from the Fund.
“Ghana’s economic activities I have to say, have surprised us on the outside. You will remember that in the programme, we were projecting economic growth of 1.5 percent for this year, and now we have the outcome for the first half of the year, and we are about 3 percent and so you can see that there are signs that are encouraging.”",citibusinessnews,Busess,"October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-clarifies-ghanas-growth-rate-projection/

IMF awaits Ghanas agreement with bilateral creditors before releasing next tranche of $3bn bailout,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it is waiting for the outcome of Ghana’s engagement with its bilateral creditors before releasing the next tranche of the $3 billion bailout package.
This was disclosed by the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, in a tweet on Wednesday after meeting Ghanaian officials to discuss the way forward.
Ghana recently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF following a review of the country’s economic progress after the first tranche of $600 million was disbursed.



Georgieva congratulated Ghana on securing the staff-level agreement.
In a tweet, she said “Great to meet @MoF_Ghana Min Ofori-Atta & @thebankofghana Gov Addison at #IMFMeetings. Congrats on the recent staff-level agreement on the Fund-supported program’s first review. Counting on bilateral creditors reaching agreement on debt relief soon to move the review forward.”
The IMF and Ghana reached a staff-level agreement on October 6 on economic policies and reforms to conclude the first review of the country’s three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility.
This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and receipt of the necessary financing assurances.
The IMF has praised Ghana’s strong policy and reform commitment under the program, which it says is bearing fruit and leading to signs of economic stabilization.
In a report, the IMF noted that growth in 2023 has proven more resilient than initially envisaged, inflation has declined, the fiscal and external positions have improved, and the exchange rate has stabilized.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has appealed to its bilateral creditors to quickly agree on current debt relief terms to enable Ghana to secure the second tranche of the package from the IMF.

Development Bank Ghana set to diversify financial offerings by introducing equity fund alongside lending activities.,"DBG’s Chief Executive Officer, K. Duker, unveiled the bank’s plans for this equity fund, aimed at expanding the range of financial products available to both institutions and borrowers at different stages of development.
DBG, established in June 2022, has already disbursed GH¢731 million across various sectors, contributing to Ghana’s economic growth and development. Mr. Duker shared the bank’s vision for the future, stating, “Our vision is clear, and our processes are streamlined. With our enhanced lending system, we’ve become more efficient, enabling faster disbursements to our partners. By the end of 2023, we aim to have disbursed an impressive GH¢1 billion.”
“We’re in the final stages of launching an equity fund. Initially, it will be relatively small, but when your only tool is lending, everything seems like a loan, which isn’t always the case. So, we need to offer other products,” emphasized Mr. Duker.



“We are currently in the final stages of regulatory approval to establish an equity fund, which will provide us with more patient capital. This will allow us to offer equity, loans, and other products to the market, creating a virtuous circle of diverse products suitable for different stages of an institution’s or borrower’s journey.”
DBG’s focus extends beyond becoming the largest lender in Ghana, emphasizing its commitment to transforming the private sector. Mr. Duker added, “If I become the largest lender without transforming the private sector, I would have failed.”
Established by the government, DBG serves as a Development Finance Institution with the primary goal of facilitating and strengthening long-term financing for Ghanaian businesses. Beyond financial services, DBG is dedicated to delivering appropriate non-financial support to enhance the country’s business ecosystem while adhering to sustainable and global best practices.
Mr. Duker reaffirmed DBG’s dedication to supporting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), job creation, and promoting inclusive and sustainable development in Ghana. To achieve this, the bank plans to expand its network of participating financial institutions (PFIs) by identifying and onboarding new PFIs. DBG aims to have at least ten PFIs by the end of the year, with Sinapi Aba being the latest addition to the network alongside existing partners such as Ecobank, Absa, and Zenith Bank.
In April of this year, DBG made headlines when it announced a seed fund of US$70 million for its partial credit guarantee scheme. This scheme was designed to provide additional support for Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to manage risks associated with loan defaults. The initiative aims to encourage more investments in high-risk sectors of the economy, strengthening the PFIs’ ability to serve the SME sector while sharing the risk of investment with DBG.
“As we move forward, we will rely on the support of all our banking partners in our initiative to digitally transform financial services,” Mr. Duker emphasized, highlighting DBG’s commitment to innovation. “We seek your continued support as we aim to be a conduit for financial institutions to collaborate on innovations, such as common underwriting standards and co-creating robust alternative credit scoring models. These joint efforts will allow us to better serve the needs of businesses while also promoting prudent lending practices and risk management within our industry.”
DBG’s expansion into equity funding marks a significant milestone in the bank’s mission to drive economic growth, foster innovation, and support the transformation of Ghana’s private sector. With a clear vision and strategic initiatives, DBG is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Ghana’s financial landscape.",Benjamin Aklama,Bankg And Fance,"October 11, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/development-bank-ghana-set-to-diversify-financial-offerings-by-introducing-equity-fund-alongside-lending-activities/

Pharmaceutical Society charged to utilize AI to transform industry,"Ghanaian businessman and Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah is encouraging pharmacists across the country to leverage the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to better position the pharmaceutical industry for economic growth.
This, he explains can be achieved by deepening collaborations with other technological bodies to offer world class pharmaceutical output for consumers.
Speaking at the 2023 Annual General Conference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana (PSG) under the theme: Pharmacist for National Development, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah emphasized the critical role played by artificial intelligence in all sectors of the economy.



“Today, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and big data have revolutionized research and learning, driving production and service delivery in ways we have never seen before. In the wake of these developments, predictions are being made that some professions and skills groups risk being replaced in the job market,” he said.
“I encourage you to apply the new technologies to indigenous health and knowledge systems, build upon them and produce world-class pharmaceutical output from them. This will require collaboration with other bodies including state and non-state actors,” he urged.
Sir Sam Jonah also charged players within the pharmaceutical industry across Africa to accelerate efforts in turning the fortunes of the industry.
According to him, the insignificant share of the global pharma industry revenue leaves more room for African pharmacists to scale up policies and relevant mechanisms to change the narrative.
The pharmaceutical industry in Africa was valued at US$ 45 billion in fiscal year 2021 and is projected to reach $60 billion by the end of 2023.
With a population of over 1.4 billion currently representing about 17.89% of the global total, Africa accounts for only about 3% of the global pharmaceutical market.
He thus encouraged Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies in Ghana to see the brighter side of every challenge and proffer solutions that will transform the economy.
“Africa’s share of the global pharmaceutical market is comparatively negligible. Therein lies the opportunity for growth. So, what is holding you back?” he said.
“The entrepreneurial and risk-aggressive among you must move decisively to form partnerships with established foreign companies with the purpose of acquiring much needed technology and liquidity through foreign direct investment,” he added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Busess, Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/pharmaceutical-society-charged-to-utilize-ai-to-transform-industry/
Apple says iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the vision OS App Store from the get-go,"While Apple’s famed Vision Pro headset is not available for purchase, the company is making sure that users get plenty of apps to use when they finally get it. The company said today that iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the visionOS’ App Store on the launch day.


This means developers won’t have to do extra work to port their existing apps. Apple said that this fall, it will release a developer beta version of the visionOS including the App Store.
“By default, your iPad and/or iPhone apps will be published automatically on the App Store on Apple Vision Pro. Most frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in visionOS, which means nearly all iPad and iPhone apps can run on visionOS, unmodified. Customers will be able to use your apps on visionOS early next year when Apple Vision Pro becomes available,” the company said in a post.

Apple announced the Vision Pro headset at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. Later that month, the company released the Vision Pro SDK for developers to play around with different elements of the visionOS. In July, Apple started accepting applications for issuing a developer kit on loan. The company has also been hosting in-person developer labs for Vision Pro in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.
The Cupertino-based tech giant said that while iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the VisionOS App Store automatically, developers can use the SDK to add 3D elements and support for hand gestures to make the apps “feel more natural” on the device.
In a recent interview with Digital Trends, Steve Sinclair, senior director of product marketing for Apple Vision Pro said that the number of SDK downloads has “exceeded” the company’s expectations.
However, because of the limited location of developer labs for in-person experience and a constrained dev kit program, a lot of developers have to work with the simulator most of the time. Sinclair said that to have a vast array of apps providing different experiences, Apple will “need to make it [the Vision Pro] accessible to every single one of our developers.”

China launches $41 billion fund to accelerate semiconductor industry,"China is taking significant steps to bolster its semiconductor industry with the launch of a colossal $41 billion fund.
This initiative, announced by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, commonly known as the “Big Fund,” marks the largest of three funds introduced by the country.
It comes as the United States tightens restrictions on chip exports to China, adding to the ongoing global competition for dominance in the semiconductor sector.



The primary focus of this substantial fund will be directed toward investments in chip manufacturing equipment, according to reports.
The fund’s mission is to amass $41 billion in financial resources, a considerable effort given its scale. In comparison, the previous funds initiated by the Big Fund in 2014 and 2019 raised approximately $19 billion and $27 billion, respectively.
Semiconductors are essential materials such as silicon used in electronic circuits and play a pivotal role in a wide array of technological applications.
Their importance has surged notably with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the intensifying global race to establish supremacy in the semiconductor industry.
The United States had already begun imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, a move that garnered attention even before the AI boom.
In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce implemented updates to export controls, significantly limiting China’s ability to advance its semiconductor and supercomputing technologies.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s most valuable semiconductor firm, is situated in Taiwan but is currently constructing a $40 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona.
This strategic move is driven by concerns of potential interference from China, with some officials in the past even suggesting that the United States would rather dismantle Taiwan’s semiconductor facilities than permit Chinese control.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need for greater self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector. In March, Xi underscored the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the face of fierce international competition.
The establishment of this extensive state-backed fund serves as a formidable response to these challenges, furthering China’s pursuit of self-reliance in the semiconductor industry despite prevailing sanctions.",Benjamin Aklama,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/china-launches-41-billion-fund-to-accelerate-semiconductor-industry/

There could even be an establishment of a secretariat for machine learning and AI to really promote and encourage start-ups that are making technology in the field of AI and machine learning to really make Impact,” he said.
On her part, the Head of Computer Science and Information Systems Department at Ashesi University, Dr. Ayorkor Korsah allayed fears that AI will in the near future take over the jobs of the current workforce. She rather impressed on the working communities to acquire the necessary skill sets to meet the new dynamics associated with emerging society.
“As we are thinking about AI and getting closer to automation, we also need to think very carefully about the structure of our society, the opportunities and education that people have access to,” she explained.
“The jobs that tend to fall off are the manual jobs and the repetitive jobs: these are very easy to automate. If the only skill one has is that then yes, your job might be taken. We have to leverage on ready opportunities to be educated as someone who is actually creating these AI tools to get jobs in areas where skills and human asset plays a role,” she added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 5, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/govt-urged-to-commit-more-investments-to-enhance-ai-competencies/
Stakeholders in digital ecosystem charged to do more to protect child privacy,"Policy Makers in the digital ecosystem are being encouraged to deepen collaborations that safeguard the data of children across the country.
This, according to the Africa Digital Rights Hub, a not profit think and action tank agency will ensure that children optimize the usage of internet related platforms while being protected.
Teki Akuetteh is the Director of Africa Digital Rights Hub and she made these comments at the launch of the Young People, Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report here in Accra.



“We continue to see that we are not adequately protecting their data or their information when it comes to their online activities so this is essentially a clarion call to policy makers and agencies that are required to protect children and their online activities to do a lot more,” she urged.
Delivering the key note address, a retired Supreme Court judge, Prof. Justice Samuel Kofi Date-Bah, underscored the correlation between young people and technology in building the country. He thus charged policy makers to find solutions to the concerns of young people about their online privacy.
“The Digital world relentlessly collects and collates data about children who use their products but the data of these children must be protected in accordance with stipulated charters on the welfare of the child,” he said.
The Young People Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report surveyed over one hundred young people between ages 13 and 17 in Accra to discover what they think about privacy and trust in this digital context.

A look into how business in Nigeria has fared since President Tinubus election,"


The performance of the business ecosystem in Nigeria, in 2023 is a subject of keen interest, as it plays a pivotal role in the country’s economic development and prosperity.






Nigeria’s private sector, comprising of businesses ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to large corporations, has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but none more seemingly so than the country’s current foreign exchange rate.


On May 29, 2023, Bola Ahmed Tinubu was inaugurated as Nigeria’s new president and immediately got to work implementing some of the policies he had promised to enact. His economic initiatives began with the removal of the controversial fuel subsidies, which he announced would be removed immediately. Just then, fuel prices in the country went up from $0.26 to as high as $0.91 before flatlining to $0.80 (according to the Naira’s current exchange rate).


It goes without saying that the sharp increase in the cost of energy created an economic shock many Nigerians were not prepared for. Ultimately, inflation rose from 22.41% in May to 22.79% in June and now stands at an 18-year high of 25.8%.


The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), notes that this increase in the inflation rate is largely a result of the president’s economic reforms. “The August inflation figure rose for an eighth straight month from July’s 24.08%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), compounding a cost of living crisis worsened by Tinubu’s reforms,” the organization noted.


However, the removal of fuel subsidies is hardly the only work at play, as the president’s other major reform, the unification of the country’s currency rates, has devalued the Nigerian currency to its worst levels yet. Prior to the unification, Nigeria’s exchange rate against USD averaged 460.702 Naira (USD/NGN), it now averages 785.5 Naira per dollar, sometimes reaching as high as N1000.


With these complications in place, it is a wonder how the Nigerian private sector has fared, especially considering that the private sector plays a major role in generating revenue for the country. It is also important to note that the president has insisted that these two moves were the right decisions to make for Nigeria’s economic recovery.


Nigeria’s private sector


Nigeria’s private sector which cuts across financial services, manufacturing, telecoms, and consumer goods, in addition to the informal sector, and others has been a major contributor to Africa’s largest economy.


The top 35 of the companies comprising this sector, according to Nairametrics, a Nigerian business news publication, reported a combined N2.146 trillion in profits in 2023 so far against a total average of N12.1 trillion in shareholder funds. Additionally, the top ten of said companies accounted for 76% of the entire market with a joint value of N27.67 trillion. Eight of the ten companies are valued above N1 trillion.


This is a brief highlight of how much Nigeria’s private sector thrives. Some of the companies alluded to above include, GTCO, UBA, Zenith Bank, Okomu Oil, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement etc.


“Among the companies analyzed that recorded return on equity include, MTN Nigeria (+43.22%), Dangote Cement (+37.23%), Zenith Bank (+36.90%), Presco (+36.17%), Fidelity Bank (+34.90%), BUA Foods (+34.18%), FCMB (+33%), etc,” the report reads in part


According to Statista; “The domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP in Nigeria increased by 1.4 percentage points (+11.54 percent) in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In total, the share amounted to 13.56 percent in 2021.”


Business Performance in Nigeria Year In the Past Year



As the naira resumed regular circulation after two months of depreciation, business activity in Africa’s largest economy grew in April 2023, according to a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released in May 2023 the PMI stood at 54.0. However, the next month, the new president’s new reform began to take hold of Nigeria’s economy.



Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a survey-based economic indicator designed to provide a timely insight into business conditions. Business conditions are said to be improving when readings are above 50.0 and deteriorating when values are below 50.0.


In June, the PMI dipped slightly to 53.2, and in July, business activity in Nigeria hit its lowest in 4 months on rising prices with a PMI of 51.7. In August the PMI declined further to 50.2, and in September, the country’s PMI increased slightly to 51.1.



PMI after Tinubu’s election






However, it is interesting to note that there have been lower PMIs recorded in 2023, prior to April of the year. In March the headline PMI stood at 42.3 and 44.7 in February, both the lowest so far in the year, and both under the former administration. However, the two-month disappointing figures were preceded by better figures.


As of last year, September’s PMI stood at 53.7, the following month read 53.6, November figures were 54.3, and by the last month of the year, the country’s PMI stood at 54.6.


The first month of 2023 recorded 53.5 before declining in February and March and then picking back up in April.



Nigeria’s PMI before Tinubu






Despite the fact that an earlier report revealed that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s reforms have had some negative impact on the economic, the figures above demonstrate the since Tinubu took over, Nigeria’s PMI has not been alarming different from the months preceeding his inuguration.


This could be because the PMI is the sum average of over 400 businesses each able to mitigate loss to varying degrees, and as such, the impact and nuances on specific businesses and industries are not detailed.


A survey of 400 businesses in the sectors of manufacturing, services, construction, and retail led to the creation of the Index, which gauges how business in the country have been performing.


It is a composite index made up of five separate indices with the following weights: New Orders (30%), Output (25%), Employment (20%), Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%), and Stock of Items Purchased (10%), with the Delivery Times index inverted so that it moves in a similar manner.

The effect of the Israel-Gaza conflict and national census ripples across SAs economy,"The South African currency fell on Monday as the unrest in the Middle East fueled risk aversion in global markets, and traders anticipated the outcome of the national census, which is due this week.

At 1510 GMT, the rand was trading at 19.4100 per dollar, down 0.6% from its Friday close.


“Trade in the rand will likely remain cautious as markets wait to see how the Middle East situation develops,” TreasuryONE currency strategist Andre Cilliers said.


As reported by the American news agency, Reuters, the US dollar rose against a basket of global currencies as confrontations between Israeli troops and the Palestinian militant group Hamas increased, sending investors fleeing to the protection of the greenback.

“While South Africa is geographically far removed from the Israel/Gaza conflict, (it) is not deemed to have shown complete neutrality towards the Russian/Ukraine war and concerns exist that this may be repeated, which would undermine the rand further,” Investec economist Annabel Bishop said in a research note.


The results from South Africa’s 2022 census, the first in more than ten years and the fourth population and housing survey since apartheid, will be made public on Tuesday by the country’s statistics office.


It is anticipated to provide an in-depth examination of the economy that will boost planning and growth in the most developed economy in Africa.


The data will be the market’s main focus as it provides information on the South African economy and its battle with high unemployment.


The blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange maintained its position, finishing unchanged. The benchmark 2030 government bond for South Africa was less strong; its yield increased by 4 basis points to 10.93%.

West Africa records growth despite coups and underperformance of its largest economies,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic recovery is defined by certain subregions overperforming in comparison to the regional average and others underperforming.

The World Bank relayed the aforementioned information in its Africa’s Pulse bi-annual report. The global lender identified how Africa is doing based on regional performance, which supports its evaluation.


The report shows that while the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the largest economies in Africa such as Nigeria and South Africa have underperformed, regions like the East African Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) are performing better than the regional average in 2023.


The presence of large areas of high development and small areas of low growth that are correlated with economic and political stability (or lack thereof) serves as confirmation of the significant diversity in growth between countries in the region.

More than three-quarters of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa is generated by the ten largest economies, seven of which are expanding at rates that are below their long-term average growth. Sudan, Ghana, and Angola are three of the nations that will do worse in 2023 than they did from 2001-2019 in terms of growth rates.


Nevertheless, development is anticipated to pick up for the majority of nations as the projected annual average growth rate for 2024-25 is greater than that of 2023 for 39 of the region’s 47 countries.


The report also notes that the largest economy in West Africa, Nigeria, is expected to experience a decline in growth from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023.


Nigeria’s “oil production remains below the OPEC+ quota amid capacity issues and lower international oil prices. Non-oil economic activity—particularly industry and services—still supports growth, although policy actions to remove fuel subsidies and unify the exchange rates might be weighing on these activities in the short term,” the report reads in part.

World Bank projects Africas economy to slow down to 2.5%,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic outlook remains bleak amid an elusive growth recovery.
According to the latest World Bank Africa’s Pulse report, rising instability, weak growth in the region’s largest economies, and lingering uncertainty in the global economy are dragging down growth prospects in the region.
Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to decelerate to 2.5% in 2023, from 3.6% in 2022. South Africa’s GDP is expected to only grow by 0.5% in 2023 as energy and transportation bottlenecks continue to bite.



Nigeria and Angola are projected to grow at 2.9% and 1.3% respectively, due to lower international prices and currency pressures affecting oil and non-oil activity.
Increased conflict and violence in the region weigh on economic activity, and this rising fragility may be exacerbated by climatic shocks. In Sudan, economic activity is expected to contract by 12% because of the internal conflict which is halting production, destroying human capital, and crippling state capacity.
In per capita terms, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has not increased since 2015. In fact, the region is projected to contract at an annual average rate per capita of 0.1% over 2015-2025, thus potentially marking a lost decade of growth in the aftermath of the 2014-15 plunge in commodity prices.
“The region’s poorest and most vulnerable people continue to bear the economic brunt of this slowdown, as weak growth translates into slow poverty reduction and poor job growth,” said Andrew Dabalen, World Bank Chief Economist for Africa.
“With up to 12 million young Africans entering the labor market across the region each year, it has never been more urgent for policymakers to transform their economies and deliver growth to people through better jobs.”
Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a few bright spots. Inflation is expected to decline from 9.3% in 2022 to 7.3% in 2023 and fiscal balances are improving in African countries that are pursuing prudent and coordinated macroeconomic policies.
In 2023, the Eastern African community (EAC) is expected to grow by 4.9% while the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is set to grow by 5.1%. However, debt distress remains widespread with 21 countries at high risk of external debt distress or in debt distress as of June 2023.
Overall, current growth rates in the region are inadequate to create enough high-quality jobs to meet increases in the working-age population.
Current growth patterns generate only 3 million formal jobs annually, thus leaving many young people underemployed and engaged in casual, piecemeal, and unstable work that does not make full use of their skills.
Creating job opportunities for the youth will drive inclusive growth and turn the continent’s demographic wealth into an economic dividend.
“The urgency of the jobs challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored by the huge opportunity from demographic transitions that we have seen in other regions,” said Nicholas Woolley, World Bank Economist and contributor to the report.
“This will require an ecosystem that facilitates private-sector development and firm growth, as well as skill development that matches business demand.”
The development of labor-intensive manufacturing seems to be missing in Africa, limiting further effects for the indirect job creation in support services and international trade. This may be partly due to a lack of capital, which continues to hamper the structural transformation required for good quality jobs.
While the region contributes 12% of the global working age population, Sub-Saharan Africa owns only 2% of the global capital stock. This means people have fewer assets with which to be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other regions.
The report identifies a set of policies to overcome hurdles and unleash job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including:
Cost-effective private sector reforms, focused on increasing competition, uniform policy enforcement across firm sizes, and regulatory alignment with regional trading partners.
Governments can also help identify and support early-stage growth of businesses through more inclusive procurement practices and promotion of local businesses abroad.
Investment in education is necessary to boost semi-skilled occupations for the region. Interventions that improve learning in school are more effective than those increasing school attendance alone, while vocational education can be useful for addressing the underemployed and those who have missed out on education as children.
Education of girls and access to jobs for women can reduce potential productivity loss from the misallocation of female labor. Cash transfers have proven effective in increasing girls’ school enrollment and attendance, as well as in curbing pregnancies among school-age girls.

Billion dollar opioid addiction market fuels Nigerias drug crisis,"A growing market of addiction to synthetic opioids estimated at over $1 billion has been identified as the fastest-growing challenge in Nigeria’s drug crisis, apart from cocaine and heroin trafficking.
The emerging challenge is fuelled by the activities of organized crime syndicates that specialize in the production, use, and trafficking of drugs, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS).
With a total of 16 methamphetamine labs seized by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as of 2019, opioid production is aided by the importation of certain chemicals for the local pharmaceutical industry.



“The most important domestic drug market is that of synthetic opioids. The number of consumers is so large that the market is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion annually, likely marking Nigeria’s single highest-value drug market,” the report states.
Most opioid usage is reportedly connected to Tramadol, which comes in pill form. Although not illicit, the wide non-medical use in Nigeria is illegal.


Almost all the tramadol seized in Nigeria in containers between 2011 and 2019 was manufactured in South and Southeast Asia. Ports in Benin Republic and Togo, which often serve as conduits for goods destined for Nigeria, also seize large volumes of the drug.
Following the import and production ban of codeine cough syrup in Nigeria in 2018, it is likely that supplies are being diverted from neighboring countries, the report said.
Prices of tramadol in Nigeria rose five-fold between 2017 and 2021. Moreover, Nigeria remains a hub in the transnational cocaine and heroin trade, with cocaine coming from Latin America using Nigeria and neighboring countries as a transit hub also a matter of concern. Most cocaine couriered into Nigeria today comes from São Paolo (Brazil) through Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to Cotonou (Benin Republic) or Lagos (Nigeria).
While Nigeria has a system in place to limit the distribution of controlled medicines to licensed pharmacists, it appears to be widely disregarded. As one group of academics observed
Much of the cannabis produced is consumed locally, while most of the methamphetamine produced seems to be exported.
A prisoner interviewed by UNODC for the report explaining the details of his role as a recruiter of labour for a cannabis plantation said he recruited dozens of boys from his community who were transported by bus to work for a year on cannabis fields in another state.

The boys were paid N120,000 naira for one year’s work after their living costs had been deducted. Some of the boys used these funds to buy cannabis to sell in the city.
In this way, part of the distribution network proceeded organically from the cultivation operation.
One survey of communities in Bayelsa State found that “the typical cultivator was a wealthy or a rich man with a strong network and connections with government officials.”
One cultivator interviewed in prison by UNODC described a 50-member association of farmers with democratically elected officers to represent their common interests, including protection from law enforcement.
The chairman of this group was said to be a person of considerable social and financial influence.
The cultivator interviewed claimed to net N2 million (about $5,000) per year.
Citing the NDLEA, the report shows that cannabis sold for between N40,000 and N50,000 naira for a 50-kilogram bag in 2015 and N25,000 for a 25-kilogram bag in 2016.
Although there has been considerable seasonal variation, with dry season prices rising to N80, 000 per bag.
On the low end, this is about $100 for 50 kilograms, or one-fifth of one US cent per gram, suggesting a low-quality, low-investment bulk product.

The relatively cheap product can generate significant profits for the people who work in the market.
Distributors reported purchasing large volumes of cannabis and reselling them for two or three times the purchase price. One female prisoner, who bought from a source and sold to urban retailers, reported getting a loan for this purpose from a registered microfinance bank in Nigeria.

Nigeria aims for $5 billion tech investment by 2027,"Nigeria is setting its sights on attracting $5 billion in annual tech startup investments by 2027, unveiling a strategic plan to bolster the local tech ecosystem and foster innovation.
Dr. Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, announced this ambitious goal as part of the country’s broader plan to accelerate its digital economy.
In a report titled “Accelerating our Collective Prosperity through Technical Efficiency: A Strategic Plan for the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation & Digital Economy,” Dr. Tijani highlighted the pivotal role of innovation, entrepreneurship, and access to financing in the global tech landscape. He emphasized the ministry’s commitment to nurturing startups, particularly those pioneering groundbreaking solutions across key economic sectors, Business Insider Africa reported.



Acknowledging the importance of patient capital in startup growth, the minister stated that the ministry aims to boost the availability of such capital locally. The objective is to create an environment conducive to startups raising the necessary funds to thrive within Nigeria, ultimately encouraging more startups to establish themselves in the country.
To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, Dr. Tijani outlined a clear target: “Increase capital raised by Nigerian tech startups 50 percent year-on-year from ~$1 billion/yr in 2022 to $5 billion/yr in 2027.”
Furthermore, the ministry plans to establish an active sandbox environment to inspire and empower entrepreneurs and innovators to devise specialized solutions for industries that have had limited exposure to technological advancements.
Nigeria also aims to substantially boost the domiciliation of local tech startups, with a target of increasing it from less than 1 percent to 25 percent by 2027. This move is expected to enhance the startups’ contributions to the Nigerian economy significantly.
Dr. Tijani stressed the growing significance of digital transformation and innovation as drivers of economic progress. He underscored the unique opportunity presented by the intersection of a robust digital economy and Nigeria’s innovative and youthful population, envisioning a path toward prosperity, inclusivity, and global relevance.

Punitive domestic tariffs threaten African trade,"Tariff and non-tariff barriers in the country remain a real threat to the vision of a liberalised African trade market under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
This is despite the fact that Ghana’s legal framework supports free trade, says a study that revealed tariff barriers are imposed as taxes and duties on imports – while non-tariff barriers (NTBs) encompass protectionist policies against foreign trade.
Combined, it said, they threaten the idea of a free continental free trade market.



Under the AFCFTA’s mandate for gradually reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers, Ghana is expected to liberalise tariffs over ten years and remove non-tariff barriers.
“Removing these restrictions will significantly increase trade within African countries,” says the study dubbed— Situational analysis of Ghana’s AFCFTA preparedness: a review of the legal, policy and regulatory Framework for implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA in Ghana).
Produced by Ishmael Yamson & Associates and Sam Okudzeto & Associates on behalf of the University of Professional Studies-Accra (UPSA) Law School, the report underscores the necessity of addressing certain challenges within the domestic legal framework to enhance the AfCFTA’s implementation.
These challenges encompass the absence of harmonisation in laws, regulations and standards across the continent.
The report suggests the country should strive to align its laws with those of other African nations to facilitate the smooth movement of goods and services across borders.
Furthermore, it highlights that insufficient funding for policy implementation, coupled with a deficiency in the necessary skills for policy execution – along with issues such as transparency deficits, inconsistent and overlapping regulations and a centralised and costly bureaucratic system – pose significant challenges.
These challenges make enforcement difficult, and compliance confusing and costly; further impeding the country’s effective participation in the free trade area.
Ghana must excel in AfCFTA implementation
In response to the report, Dr. Fareed Arthur, Head-National AfCFTA Coordination Office, expressed gratitude to UPSA Law School and the authors for their extensive work.
He also mentioned that while he appreciates the report, there are certain points on which he holds differing opinions.
“Depending on where and what you are looking at, the issue of preparedness comes out differently. It [AfCFTA] is a new experiment. We are still negotiating parts of the World Trade Organisation protocols even after its existence for over 50 years. In these agreements, you can never be entirely prepared because it’s an ongoing and evolving process.  AfCFTA is not a one-time event that you prepare for and then simply sit,” said Dr. Arthur.
With that said, he believes the study’s findings will contribute to the government’s efforts in harnessing the benefits which AfCFTA bring, saying: “The narrative is that Ghana consistently perceives itself as a leading force in the political liberation of this continent. We believe that AfCFTA represents the economic frontier, and as such Ghana must excel in its implementation”.
AfCTA must never fail
The commencement of AfCFTA creates the world’s largest free trade area, encompassing the most countries in its reach.
This historic pact links 55 countries, uniting 1.3 billion people and boasting a collective gross domestic product (GDP) valued at US$ 3.4 trillion.
Moreover, it holds the promise of uplifting 30 million individuals from extreme poverty. However, realising its full potential hinges on the implementation of substantial policy reforms and the facilitation of trade.
Deputy Trade and Industry Minister, Michael Okyere Baafi – who launched the report, emphasised that the concept of free trade on the continent is not only a game-changer but also an opportunity for Africans to discover and leverage the potential of Africa to their advantage.
He also envisions this development as a means to transform the African continent into a place that is regarded as the best in the world by everyone.
“We are exploring Africa to see the opportunities available. So, let’s make sure that Africans take advantage of all the opportunities available in Africa. This is the way to make the continent rich and avoid travelling to the West for loans,” he said.
“So, we cannot fail. It’s important that as a country we strive to ensure this concept [AfCFTA] works, as host of the secretariat. It must never be allowed to fail,” he added.

"Ofori-Atta commends G20 for AUs inclusion, urges common voice","The Minister for Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta says Africa now has the opportunity to contribute to key global issues and push for common interests that would help accelerate economic development in the region.
Mr. Ofori-Atta’s optimism follows the recent inclusion of the African Union in the Group of 20 most important industrialized and developing economies, also known as the G20. It becomes the second regional bloc to join the group after the European Union.
‘There had been several decisions taken without Africa on the board and thank God the G20 agreed that Africa will have a seat so we will be part of the designing the solutions to our Global challenges,’’ the Finance Minister said.



He was speaking at a panel on the Energy Transition Accelerator organized by the Rockefeller Foundation on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly.
The minister added that the inclusion is long overdue, hoping that it will create a balance in global institutions.
The Group of 20
The G20 was formed as an informal group in 1999 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, providing a platform for finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 of the world’s largest and emerging economies. It later included heads of state and governments.
The group has since widened its scope beyond finance and economics, adding some of the world’s pressing challenges to its agenda. It includes health, climate change, food security, energy and sustainable development.
‘Our admission provides another opportunity to push for accelerated reforms in the global financial system to ensure developing nations are treated fairly,’ Mr Ofori-Atta said.
Until the admission of the African Union as a permanent member, the 19-member group jointly accounted for more than 80% of global productivity, 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world’s population.
Despite Africa joining the group with 3% of global economic output, the 55 member states come with a population of 1.3 billion people, largely in their youthful and productive stages of life.
The continent is aggressively pushing for inclusion at all international tables where decisions that affect its people are taken.
The Finance Minister said Africa will come with common positions on issues of international concern, especially the ones that affect the continent the most.
‘Africa will speak with one voice to ensure we make good use of our membership to help realize the aspirations of our people,’ Mr Ofori-Atta stated.",citibusinessnews,"Africa, Featured","September 21, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/ofori-atta-commends-g20-for-aus-inclusion-urges-common-voice/

"IMF: Ghana has fulfilled obligations, awaiting creditor action on debt restructuring","The Director of the African Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Abebe Aemro Selassie, has confirmed that Ghana has taken the required steps to secure the long-awaited financing assurance from its external creditors.
He added that the IMF is patiently awaiting responses from bilateral creditors.
“I have to tell you that whereas it took something like nine months or more for Zambia to get the official creditor committee to be created, in Ghana’s case, it was fairly rapid…Ghana has done its fair share and it’s for the creditors to take steps,” Mr. Selassie said when addressing journalists following the publication of Africa’s Regional Outlook Report during the Annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco.



He added “We’re not going to be asking the government to do more adjustment because creditors haven’t asked either. We will provide all the information necessary, so creditors can move, allowing us to go to the Board as soon as possible.”
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta earlier disclosed that Ghana had secured assurances from both China and France regarding the Memorandum of Outstanding (MoU) for the restructuring of the country’s external bilateral debts.
“We have met the Central Bank Governor of China and we don’t perceive any opposition or reluctance in participating positively when it comes to the Memorandum of Understanding on restructuring of our external bilateral debts” the finance minister said.
Responding to inquiries from journalists at the Annual International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr Ofori-Atta added, “The Chinese government within the past months is close to reaching a similar deal with Zambia, Sri Lanka and Suriname, so following that trend, we expect some similar cooperation from them when it comes to Ghana”.
Mr Ofori-Atta in an earlier interview described the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings as an opportunity for a new beginning for the global financial architecture.
In his remarks at a Roundtable Discussion on “IMF Policy Priorities,” Mr Ofori-Atta charged the IMF to strengthen the global financial safety net through bold reforms to the global financial architecture.
During the Roundtable hosted by US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Mr Ofori-Atta praised the transformative leadership of IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, which has led to the achievement of truly momentous things.
He however continued, “We need to stretch the IMF to do more. The need is great. And at these Annual Meetings, the developing world is asking the international community to do all it can to advance a reform agenda that ensures institutions like the IMF have the requisite mandates, financing, and governance models to deliver transformative impact.”",citibusinessnews,"Featured, Local Economy","October 16, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-ghana-has-fulfilled-obligations-awaiting-creditor-action-on-debt-restructuring/
"IMF, World Bank work to accelerate debt treatment for Ghana, others under G20","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are working together to accelerate debt restructuring for Ghana and other countries under the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework.
Ms Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF said this during a plenary meeting at the 2023 IMF/WGB Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“The IMF and the World Bank are bringing all relevant creditors and debtors together with promising signs,” the IMF Managing Director said.



She explained that the two global financial institutions were doing so because the progress of the Common Framework on delivering on debt restructurings had been slow. The move is one of the supporting-pillars of the two-thronged “no regrets” actions for the next fifty years, captured in the Marrakech Principles, aimed at closing the divergent global income gap and generate job-rich growth for all.
The two policy actions are – investment in strong economic foundations, and investment in global cooperation.
More than half of low-income countries remained in or were at risk of debt distress, with about half of emerging economies facing default-like debt spreads. That, Ms Georgieva, said required prompt delivery of debt treatment, which would be beneficial to both creditors and debtors.
On the Fund’s support beyond pushing for speedy debt negotiations, she said, about US$1 trillion in liquidity and financing had been provided to countries across the world since the
“This came via the US$650bn Special Drawing Right (SDR) and US$320bn in lending to 96 countries, including 56 low-income nations,” she said.
“Our meetings here in Marrakech, the Red, leave me in no doubt that, together, we will unlock the door to opportunities for the next generation,” the IMF Managing Director said.
“Debt has increased throughout emerging markets – doubling in Africa – shackling
countries to the ground just as they’re trying to rise, Mr Banga, the World Bank President
noted.
He said it had become important to reimagine partnerships and have innovative plans to address the debt and other economic and climate change challenges for a liveable planet.
“We took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing US$40bn over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio,” the World Bank President said.
He added that the Bank had also created a portfolio guarantee mechanism, together with the launch of a hybrid capital instrument to enable it take risks and boost its lending capacity, the more.
“Taken together, we could provide US$157bn more in lending over a decade,” Mr Banga
said.
Immediate steps were taken to lessen the debt burden of low-income countries after the COVID-19 pandemic, where countries called on the IMF and World Bank to lend their support to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).
This was after a decision by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting to endorse the suspension of debt service of most vulnerable countries of under the Group.
Further action was taken later on in 2020 by the G20 Finance Ministers in endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI to facilitate the timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries.
Since then, Ghana, Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia have requested for debt restructuring, and
are at various stages of deals with Official Creditors.
Ghana, for example, looks forward to signing a pact with external creditors for a second tranche of US$600m from IMF, Zambia reached an agreement on Saturday, October 14, 2023, and awaiting official signing of agreement.

Zambia advises Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation,"Mr Situmbeko Musokotwane, Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zambia, has advised Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation.
“We put a law in Parliament which tied my hands to say, going forward, you can’t be like those in the past. So, we tied our hands for Parliament to have more power and restrictions on borrowing,” he said.
That should be combined with reforms to maintain credibility with creditors, international community, and citizens, as well as create a conducive environment for private sector investment for value addition.



He expressed confidence that such action would hasten the processes of concluding debt treatment, grow the
economy, increase domestic revenue, create more jobs and uplift the living standards of people, and help avoid future debt crisis.
Minister Musokotwane said this as he shared the experience of Zambian authorities, who on Saturday, October 14, 2023, formalised on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with its Official Creditors on restructuring of some US$6.3 billion debt.
Zambia, the first African country to default on its debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, reached an agreement in
principle in June, and currently awaiting to sign an MoU for the restructuring of its debt.
He spoke at the African Finance Ministers press briefing on Saturday, October 14, 2023, in Marrakech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG) Annual Meetings.
He explained that it was important for the country to take prudent measures not to accumulate high debts by having strong structural and sustainable reforms, while investing in education, healthcare, infrastructure and industrialisation.
“To get the support of the international community – lenders and other people, obviously, must conclude that you’re worthy of their support, and willing to take steps to assist yourself,” he noted.
“We’ve learnt a lot, and for people like you [Ghana], you’ve been lucky,” Mr Musokotwane said, with respect to Ghana gaining external creditors assurance and securing an IMF programme in five months.
Among others, Ghana has a Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2018 (Act 982), which requires government not to spend beyond a threshold that would push fiscal deficit above five per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
However, it was suspended in 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the government envisaged that it would not meet the five per cent deficit threshold.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance and B Bank of Ghana (BoG) have signed an MoU, providing for zero monetary financing throughout the IMF US$3 billion loan-support programme with Ghana.
Meanwhile, Ghana’s economic growth had averaged 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters of 2023, something that Dr. Ernest Addison, Governor, BoG, explained, should make government “operate without access to central bank financing.”

"2024 budget: Government commits to more expenditure cuts, aggressive growth, jobs","The government has assured Ghanaians that it will safeguard current economic gains, and make it reflect in the living conditions of everyone in the coming months.
To this end, there would be more expenditure reduction measures in the 2024 budget, as well as policies to consolidate macroeconomic gains, ensuring that inflation and exchange rate are tamed.
Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Finance Minister and Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, Information Minister, gave the
assurances on Friday evening ahead of the budget presentation in November.



They spoke on the sidelines of the 2023 International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG)
Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“You’ll see more prudent fiscal measures in the 2024 budget to keep the macroeconomy stable so that inflation continues to go down and the currency remains stable. That’s an assurance from government that will surely happen” Mr Ofori-Atta said.
“We’ll also find various incentives and resources into the growth agenda that we have to catalyse the
private sector to thrive,” the Minister pledged during a press briefing.
The government introduced a number of cost-cutting measures in the 2023 budget, including, a freeze on
employment in the public sector, reduction in salaries of some government officials, aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability.
In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Nkrumah said those measures had started yielding
positive results, but the government would do more, which would be specified in the 2024 budget.
“Although we don’t have the final figures, one of the clearest ways to examine the performance of the measures to reduce expenditure is to look at the primary balance, and there’s a clear indication that we’re doing well to stay within the revenue envelope that we have,” he said.
Ghana’s primary balance – the difference between the amount of revenue the government collects and
spends on providing public goods and services, excluding debt payment, was −1.3 as of the first half of
2022, but stood at 0.6 the same period, 2023.
Reiterating government’s commitment to fiscal discipline, Mr Nkrumah said: “Going forward, our focus is
to stay on that path to ensure that we don’t blow the fiscals out of gear.”
Some Civil Society Groups, Economists and Governance experts in the country have been calling for a
reduction in the number of ministers and government officials as part of measure to maintain fiscal
discipline, but that is yet to happen.
They have also encouraged the government to be more aggressive on collecting property taxes, incentivize to rope the informal sector into the tax net, and reduce the rate of the Electronic Transactions Levy (E-levy) to about 0.5 per cent from the one per cent.
That they expressed confidence in increasing domestic revenue to support expenditure reduction measures, making the economy more robust.

With a relentless commitment to serving its customers better, the Bank has consistently led the way in redefining banking in Ghana through innovative solutions. One significant milestone in Zenith’s innovation journey was its pioneering venture into online banking, revolutionizing the way customers managed their finances.

The Bank continues to deepen its engagement with customers and its accessibility to them through initiatives such as its 24hour Customer Contact Centre, Zenith Direct, which features channels such as Z-Chat (an online live chat platform), the Complaints Portal, Voice Calls, and Email – where customers can seek information about products and services, provide service feedback to the Bank, or report complaints. The Bank’s unwavering commitment to a customer-centric approach, characterized by open communication and support for clients during difficult times has fostered trust and loyalty.

In commemoration of the 18th Anniversary celebration, Zenith Bank Ghana organised a prayer and thanksgiving service to thank the Almighty God for 18 successful years of Banking operations in Ghana.

A key highlight of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary celebration was the Bank’s presentation of a cheque of GHS150,000 to the Pediatric Oncology Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).  The presentation, which was in furtherance of the Bank’s CSR objective of giving back to the society in which it operates was in response to an appeal by Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG), a non-governmental organization dedicated to making childhood cancer a national health priority whilst facilitating and increasing access to optimal medical care and treatment for children with cancer.
Speaking at the presentation, the MD/CEO stated that, “When Akua Sarpong, the Co-founder and Executive Directive of Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG) spoke with our colleagues about the cause she is championing, we saw that it is one that needed some form of assistance especially from corporate institutions, and we readily and willingly supported this very worthy cause as September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month globally as well as the month of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary”.
Speaking on behalf of LCCG and the Oncology Unit, Prof. Lorna Reinner, Pediatric Oncologist at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital who spoke on behalf of the Pediatric Oncology Unit expressed appreciation to Zenith Bank for the very kind gesture. She indicated that the LCCG and the hospital are currently working towards the expansion of the pediatric oncology block to increase the current facility’s capacity to include a 40-bed children’s ward to enable the hospital improve treatment and care for patients; as such the Bank’s donation which was apt and timely and would go towards the construction of the new ward.
Prof. Reinner thus noted that increased support from other corporate institutions would greatly help the unit improve treatment outcomes for children with cancer and their families given the needed support.
Prior to the presentation at the Pediatric Oncology Units, earlier in the week, the Bank organised a Virtual Health Talk for staff on “Childhood Cancer –to create awareness of Childhood cancer and to educate staff on the signs, symptoms, preventive measures and treatment options available for patients.

For every customer that signed up for a product, they received an instant gift from the Bank to the delight of many.
The Bank’s online audience was not left out of the celebration as followers of the Bank’s social media pages also enjoyed fun and interactive games and rewards that kept them glued to the pages.
To climax the celebration, the Bank organised a TGIF/Karaoke Night across all branches to appreciate staff for their hard work, loyalty and commitment to the success of the Bank.

This follows his failure to pay in full an amount of GH¢90 million he agreed to pay the state despite several lifelines given him since December 2022.
Ato Essien pleaded guilty to 16 counts of stealing, money laundering and conspiracy to steal for his role in the collapse of Capital Bank.



He however entered a plea bargain with the state under section 35(7) of the courts ACT 459.
Under the agreement, Mr. Essien was expected to pay GH¢90 million for which he paid GH¢30 million cedis on December 13.
He was to pay the GH¢60 million remainder in three equal instalments in 2023; GH¢20 million by April 28, another GH¢20 million by August 31 and the last GH¢20 million by December 15, 2023.
A major condition of the agreement was that the court would not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence if he missed any of the payment deadlines.
But as of April 28, Mr. Essien had not paid all the GH¢20 million due to be settled.
The state filed an application on May 2, 2023, to get a custodial sentence imposed on the convict (Ato Essien).
But that application was not heard as the presiding judge, Justice Eric Kyei Baffour gave him (Ato Essien) about six months to redeem himself.
But between January this year to October 12, Ato Essien has only paid GH¢7 million in addition to the GH¢30 million previously paid.
With GH¢53 million of the agreed sum outstanding, the judge having exhausted his patience allowed the state to move the application.
The judge upon hearing the application jailed Ato Essien to spend 15 years in prison.",citibusinessnews,"Bankg And Fance, Featured","October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/former-capital-bank-ceo-ato-essien-jailed-15-years/
IMF clarifies Ghanas growth rate projection,"The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Resident Representative in Ghana, Dr. Leandro Medina, has clarified that the growth rate for the country has not been revised to 1.2% from the May 2023 forecast of 1.5%.
Dr. Medina explained that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection of 1.2% growth for 2023 is based on an old set of projections that do not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2% for the first two quarters).
He added that based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, the IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5% previously assumed.



Various media portals reported that the IMF had lowered Ghana’s growth rate to 1.2% making it the second time the Fund had revised Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for 2023.
But Dr Medina in a statement clarifying the issue said “The latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection (1.2 per cent growth for 2023) is based on an old vintage of Fund staff projections. In particular, it does not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters).
“At the current juncture, and based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5 percent previously assumed.”

Stéphane Roudet, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Mission Chief to Ghana in an interview on the Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, October 9 also lauded Ghana’s economic growth.
Mr Roudet intimated that Ghana’s quick economic recovery is surprising and also encouraging, as the country has outperformed the IMF’s projection for the year 2023.
He indicated that the IMF had projected Ghana’s economy to grow at a rate of 1.5 percent by the year ending 2023, but the first-half report shows that the country’s economy is growing at a rate of 3 percent, which he said is very encouraging and will go a long way to ensuring the smooth disbursement of the second tranche of the $3 billion credit facility from the Fund.
“Ghana’s economic activities I have to say, have surprised us on the outside. You will remember that in the programme, we were projecting economic growth of 1.5 percent for this year, and now we have the outcome for the first half of the year, and we are about 3 percent and so you can see that there are signs that are encouraging.”",citibusinessnews,Busess,"October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-clarifies-ghanas-growth-rate-projection/

IMF awaits Ghanas agreement with bilateral creditors before releasing next tranche of $3bn bailout,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it is waiting for the outcome of Ghana’s engagement with its bilateral creditors before releasing the next tranche of the $3 billion bailout package.
This was disclosed by the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, in a tweet on Wednesday after meeting Ghanaian officials to discuss the way forward.
Ghana recently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF following a review of the country’s economic progress after the first tranche of $600 million was disbursed.



Georgieva congratulated Ghana on securing the staff-level agreement.
In a tweet, she said “Great to meet @MoF_Ghana Min Ofori-Atta & @thebankofghana Gov Addison at #IMFMeetings. Congrats on the recent staff-level agreement on the Fund-supported program’s first review. Counting on bilateral creditors reaching agreement on debt relief soon to move the review forward.”
The IMF and Ghana reached a staff-level agreement on October 6 on economic policies and reforms to conclude the first review of the country’s three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility.
This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and receipt of the necessary financing assurances.
The IMF has praised Ghana’s strong policy and reform commitment under the program, which it says is bearing fruit and leading to signs of economic stabilization.
In a report, the IMF noted that growth in 2023 has proven more resilient than initially envisaged, inflation has declined, the fiscal and external positions have improved, and the exchange rate has stabilized.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has appealed to its bilateral creditors to quickly agree on current debt relief terms to enable Ghana to secure the second tranche of the package from the IMF.

Development Bank Ghana set to diversify financial offerings by introducing equity fund alongside lending activities.,"DBG’s Chief Executive Officer, K. Duker, unveiled the bank’s plans for this equity fund, aimed at expanding the range of financial products available to both institutions and borrowers at different stages of development.
DBG, established in June 2022, has already disbursed GH¢731 million across various sectors, contributing to Ghana’s economic growth and development. Mr. Duker shared the bank’s vision for the future, stating, “Our vision is clear, and our processes are streamlined. With our enhanced lending system, we’ve become more efficient, enabling faster disbursements to our partners. By the end of 2023, we aim to have disbursed an impressive GH¢1 billion.”
“We’re in the final stages of launching an equity fund. Initially, it will be relatively small, but when your only tool is lending, everything seems like a loan, which isn’t always the case. So, we need to offer other products,” emphasized Mr. Duker.



“We are currently in the final stages of regulatory approval to establish an equity fund, which will provide us with more patient capital. This will allow us to offer equity, loans, and other products to the market, creating a virtuous circle of diverse products suitable for different stages of an institution’s or borrower’s journey.”
DBG’s focus extends beyond becoming the largest lender in Ghana, emphasizing its commitment to transforming the private sector. Mr. Duker added, “If I become the largest lender without transforming the private sector, I would have failed.”
Established by the government, DBG serves as a Development Finance Institution with the primary goal of facilitating and strengthening long-term financing for Ghanaian businesses. Beyond financial services, DBG is dedicated to delivering appropriate non-financial support to enhance the country’s business ecosystem while adhering to sustainable and global best practices.
Mr. Duker reaffirmed DBG’s dedication to supporting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), job creation, and promoting inclusive and sustainable development in Ghana. To achieve this, the bank plans to expand its network of participating financial institutions (PFIs) by identifying and onboarding new PFIs. DBG aims to have at least ten PFIs by the end of the year, with Sinapi Aba being the latest addition to the network alongside existing partners such as Ecobank, Absa, and Zenith Bank.
In April of this year, DBG made headlines when it announced a seed fund of US$70 million for its partial credit guarantee scheme. This scheme was designed to provide additional support for Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to manage risks associated with loan defaults. The initiative aims to encourage more investments in high-risk sectors of the economy, strengthening the PFIs’ ability to serve the SME sector while sharing the risk of investment with DBG.
“As we move forward, we will rely on the support of all our banking partners in our initiative to digitally transform financial services,” Mr. Duker emphasized, highlighting DBG’s commitment to innovation. “We seek your continued support as we aim to be a conduit for financial institutions to collaborate on innovations, such as common underwriting standards and co-creating robust alternative credit scoring models. These joint efforts will allow us to better serve the needs of businesses while also promoting prudent lending practices and risk management within our industry.”
DBG’s expansion into equity funding marks a significant milestone in the bank’s mission to drive economic growth, foster innovation, and support the transformation of Ghana’s private sector. With a clear vision and strategic initiatives, DBG is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Ghana’s financial landscape.",Benjamin Aklama,Bankg And Fance,"October 11, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/development-bank-ghana-set-to-diversify-financial-offerings-by-introducing-equity-fund-alongside-lending-activities/

Pharmaceutical Society charged to utilize AI to transform industry,"Ghanaian businessman and Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah is encouraging pharmacists across the country to leverage the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to better position the pharmaceutical industry for economic growth.
This, he explains can be achieved by deepening collaborations with other technological bodies to offer world class pharmaceutical output for consumers.
Speaking at the 2023 Annual General Conference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana (PSG) under the theme: Pharmacist for National Development, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah emphasized the critical role played by artificial intelligence in all sectors of the economy.



“Today, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and big data have revolutionized research and learning, driving production and service delivery in ways we have never seen before. In the wake of these developments, predictions are being made that some professions and skills groups risk being replaced in the job market,” he said.
“I encourage you to apply the new technologies to indigenous health and knowledge systems, build upon them and produce world-class pharmaceutical output from them. This will require collaboration with other bodies including state and non-state actors,” he urged.
Sir Sam Jonah also charged players within the pharmaceutical industry across Africa to accelerate efforts in turning the fortunes of the industry.
According to him, the insignificant share of the global pharma industry revenue leaves more room for African pharmacists to scale up policies and relevant mechanisms to change the narrative.
The pharmaceutical industry in Africa was valued at US$ 45 billion in fiscal year 2021 and is projected to reach $60 billion by the end of 2023.
With a population of over 1.4 billion currently representing about 17.89% of the global total, Africa accounts for only about 3% of the global pharmaceutical market.
He thus encouraged Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies in Ghana to see the brighter side of every challenge and proffer solutions that will transform the economy.
“Africa’s share of the global pharmaceutical market is comparatively negligible. Therein lies the opportunity for growth. So, what is holding you back?” he said.
“The entrepreneurial and risk-aggressive among you must move decisively to form partnerships with established foreign companies with the purpose of acquiring much needed technology and liquidity through foreign direct investment,” he added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Busess, Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/pharmaceutical-society-charged-to-utilize-ai-to-transform-industry/
Apple says iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the vision OS App Store from the get-go,"While Apple’s famed Vision Pro headset is not available for purchase, the company is making sure that users get plenty of apps to use when they finally get it. The company said today that iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the visionOS’ App Store on the launch day.


This means developers won’t have to do extra work to port their existing apps. Apple said that this fall, it will release a developer beta version of the visionOS including the App Store.
“By default, your iPad and/or iPhone apps will be published automatically on the App Store on Apple Vision Pro. Most frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in visionOS, which means nearly all iPad and iPhone apps can run on visionOS, unmodified. Customers will be able to use your apps on visionOS early next year when Apple Vision Pro becomes available,” the company said in a post.

Apple announced the Vision Pro headset at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. Later that month, the company released the Vision Pro SDK for developers to play around with different elements of the visionOS. In July, Apple started accepting applications for issuing a developer kit on loan. The company has also been hosting in-person developer labs for Vision Pro in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.
The Cupertino-based tech giant said that while iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the VisionOS App Store automatically, developers can use the SDK to add 3D elements and support for hand gestures to make the apps “feel more natural” on the device.
In a recent interview with Digital Trends, Steve Sinclair, senior director of product marketing for Apple Vision Pro said that the number of SDK downloads has “exceeded” the company’s expectations.
However, because of the limited location of developer labs for in-person experience and a constrained dev kit program, a lot of developers have to work with the simulator most of the time. Sinclair said that to have a vast array of apps providing different experiences, Apple will “need to make it [the Vision Pro] accessible to every single one of our developers.”

China launches $41 billion fund to accelerate semiconductor industry,"China is taking significant steps to bolster its semiconductor industry with the launch of a colossal $41 billion fund.
This initiative, announced by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, commonly known as the “Big Fund,” marks the largest of three funds introduced by the country.
It comes as the United States tightens restrictions on chip exports to China, adding to the ongoing global competition for dominance in the semiconductor sector.



The primary focus of this substantial fund will be directed toward investments in chip manufacturing equipment, according to reports.
The fund’s mission is to amass $41 billion in financial resources, a considerable effort given its scale. In comparison, the previous funds initiated by the Big Fund in 2014 and 2019 raised approximately $19 billion and $27 billion, respectively.
Semiconductors are essential materials such as silicon used in electronic circuits and play a pivotal role in a wide array of technological applications.
Their importance has surged notably with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the intensifying global race to establish supremacy in the semiconductor industry.
The United States had already begun imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, a move that garnered attention even before the AI boom.
In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce implemented updates to export controls, significantly limiting China’s ability to advance its semiconductor and supercomputing technologies.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s most valuable semiconductor firm, is situated in Taiwan but is currently constructing a $40 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona.
This strategic move is driven by concerns of potential interference from China, with some officials in the past even suggesting that the United States would rather dismantle Taiwan’s semiconductor facilities than permit Chinese control.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need for greater self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector. In March, Xi underscored the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the face of fierce international competition.
The establishment of this extensive state-backed fund serves as a formidable response to these challenges, furthering China’s pursuit of self-reliance in the semiconductor industry despite prevailing sanctions.",Benjamin Aklama,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/china-launches-41-billion-fund-to-accelerate-semiconductor-industry/

Govt. urged to commit more investments to enhance AI competencies,"Government has been encouraged to commit more investment towards building the competencies of the student population in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help transform the country in the technological space.
This, according to Deep Learning Indaba, a non-profit organization will strengthen machine learning and promote African innovators towards economic resilience.
Delali Agbenyegah is one of the General Chairs of Deep Learning and he spoke on the sidelines of the INDABA X conference here in Accra.



“We need investment, so the government must actually invest in the field of AI and machine learning. There could even be an establishment of a secretariat for machine learning and AI to really promote and encourage start-ups that are making technology in the field of AI and machine learning to really make Impact,” he said.
On her part, the Head of Computer Science and Information Systems Department at Ashesi University, Dr. Ayorkor Korsah allayed fears that AI will in the near future take over the jobs of the current workforce. She rather impressed on the working communities to acquire the necessary skill sets to meet the new dynamics associated with emerging society.
“As we are thinking about AI and getting closer to automation, we also need to think very carefully about the structure of our society, the opportunities and education that people have access to,” she explained.
“The jobs that tend to fall off are the manual jobs and the repetitive jobs: these are very easy to automate. If the only skill one has is that then yes, your job might be taken. We have to leverage on ready opportunities to be educated as someone who is actually creating these AI tools to get jobs in areas where skills and human asset plays a role,” she added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 5, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/govt-urged-to-commit-more-investments-to-enhance-ai-competencies/
Stakeholders in digital ecosystem charged to do more to protect child privacy,"Policy Makers in the digital ecosystem are being encouraged to deepen collaborations that safeguard the data of children across the country.
This, according to the Africa Digital Rights Hub, a not profit think and action tank agency will ensure that children optimize the usage of internet related platforms while being protected.
Teki Akuetteh is the Director of Africa Digital Rights Hub and she made these comments at the launch of the Young People, Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report here in Accra.



“We continue to see that we are not adequately protecting their data or their information when it comes to their online activities so this is essentially a clarion call to policy makers and agencies that are required to protect children and their online activities to do a lot more,” she urged.
Delivering the key note address, a retired Supreme Court judge, Prof. Justice Samuel Kofi Date-Bah, underscored the correlation between young people and technology in building the country. He thus charged policy makers to find solutions to the concerns of young people about their online privacy.
“The Digital world relentlessly collects and collates data about children who use their products but the data of these children must be protected in accordance with stipulated charters on the welfare of the child,” he said.
The Young People Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report surveyed over one hundred young people between ages 13 and 17 in Accra to discover what they think about privacy and trust in this digital context.
The report proffers eight pointer recommendations to safeguard the privacy of children by children including providing young users with more control or ownership of their data.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, General, TECHNOLOGY","August 29, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/08/stakeholders-in-digital-ecosystem-charged-to-do-more-to-protect-child-privacy/
A look into how business in Nigeria has fared since President Tinubus election,"


The performance of the business ecosystem in Nigeria, in 2023 is a subject of keen interest, as it plays a pivotal role in the country’s economic development and prosperity.






Nigeria’s private sector, comprising of businesses ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to large corporations, has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but none more seemingly so than the country’s current foreign exchange rate.


On May 29, 2023, Bola Ahmed Tinubu was inaugurated as Nigeria’s new president and immediately got to work implementing some of the policies he had promised to enact. His economic initiatives began with the removal of the controversial fuel subsidies, which he announced would be removed immediately. Just then, fuel prices in the country went up from $0.26 to as high as $0.91 before flatlining to $0.80 (according to the Naira’s current exchange rate).


It goes without saying that the sharp increase in the cost of energy created an economic shock many Nigerians were not prepared for. Ultimately, inflation rose from 22.41% in May to 22.79% in June and now stands at an 18-year high of 25.8%.


The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), notes that this increase in the inflation rate is largely a result of the president’s economic reforms. “The August inflation figure rose for an eighth straight month from July’s 24.08%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), compounding a cost of living crisis worsened by Tinubu’s reforms,” the organization noted.


However, the removal of fuel subsidies is hardly the only work at play, as the president’s other major reform, the unification of the country’s currency rates, has devalued the Nigerian currency to its worst levels yet. Prior to the unification, Nigeria’s exchange rate against USD averaged 460.702 Naira (USD/NGN), it now averages 785.5 Naira per dollar, sometimes reaching as high as N1000.


With these complications in place, it is a wonder how the Nigerian private sector has fared, especially considering that the private sector plays a major role in generating revenue for the country. It is also important to note that the president has insisted that these two moves were the right decisions to make for Nigeria’s economic recovery.


Nigeria’s private sector


Nigeria’s private sector which cuts across financial services, manufacturing, telecoms, and consumer goods, in addition to the informal sector, and others has been a major contributor to Africa’s largest economy.


The top 35 of the companies comprising this sector, according to Nairametrics, a Nigerian business news publication, reported a combined N2.146 trillion in profits in 2023 so far against a total average of N12.1 trillion in shareholder funds. Additionally, the top ten of said companies accounted for 76% of the entire market with a joint value of N27.67 trillion. Eight of the ten companies are valued above N1 trillion.


This is a brief highlight of how much Nigeria’s private sector thrives. Some of the companies alluded to above include, GTCO, UBA, Zenith Bank, Okomu Oil, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement etc.


“Among the companies analyzed that recorded return on equity include, MTN Nigeria (+43.22%), Dangote Cement (+37.23%), Zenith Bank (+36.90%), Presco (+36.17%), Fidelity Bank (+34.90%), BUA Foods (+34.18%), FCMB (+33%), etc,” the report reads in part


According to Statista; “The domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP in Nigeria increased by 1.4 percentage points (+11.54 percent) in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In total, the share amounted to 13.56 percent in 2021.”


Business Performance in Nigeria Year In the Past Year



As the naira resumed regular circulation after two months of depreciation, business activity in Africa’s largest economy grew in April 2023, according to a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released in May 2023 the PMI stood at 54.0. However, the next month, the new president’s new reform began to take hold of Nigeria’s economy.



Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a survey-based economic indicator designed to provide a timely insight into business conditions. Business conditions are said to be improving when readings are above 50.0 and deteriorating when values are below 50.0.


In June, the PMI dipped slightly to 53.2, and in July, business activity in Nigeria hit its lowest in 4 months on rising prices with a PMI of 51.7. In August the PMI declined further to 50.2, and in September, the country’s PMI increased slightly to 51.1.



PMI after Tinubu’s election






However, it is interesting to note that there have been lower PMIs recorded in 2023, prior to April of the year. In March the headline PMI stood at 42.3 and 44.7 in February, both the lowest so far in the year, and both under the former administration. However, the two-month disappointing figures were preceded by better figures.


As of last year, September’s PMI stood at 53.7, the following month read 53.6, November figures were 54.3, and by the last month of the year, the country’s PMI stood at 54.6.


The first month of 2023 recorded 53.5 before declining in February and March and then picking back up in April.



Nigeria’s PMI before Tinubu






Despite the fact that an earlier report revealed that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s reforms have had some negative impact on the economic, the figures above demonstrate the since Tinubu took over, Nigeria’s PMI has not been alarming different from the months preceeding his inuguration.


This could be because the PMI is the sum average of over 400 businesses each able to mitigate loss to varying degrees, and as such, the impact and nuances on specific businesses and industries are not detailed.


A survey of 400 businesses in the sectors of manufacturing, services, construction, and retail led to the creation of the Index, which gauges how business in the country have been performing.


It is a composite index made up of five separate indices with the following weights: New Orders (30%), Output (25%), Employment (20%), Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%), and Stock of Items Purchased (10%), with the Delivery Times index inverted so that it moves in a similar manner.

The effect of the Israel-Gaza conflict and national census ripples across SAs economy,"The South African currency fell on Monday as the unrest in the Middle East fueled risk aversion in global markets, and traders anticipated the outcome of the national census, which is due this week.

At 1510 GMT, the rand was trading at 19.4100 per dollar, down 0.6% from its Friday close.


“Trade in the rand will likely remain cautious as markets wait to see how the Middle East situation develops,” TreasuryONE currency strategist Andre Cilliers said.


As reported by the American news agency, Reuters, the US dollar rose against a basket of global currencies as confrontations between Israeli troops and the Palestinian militant group Hamas increased, sending investors fleeing to the protection of the greenback.

“While South Africa is geographically far removed from the Israel/Gaza conflict, (it) is not deemed to have shown complete neutrality towards the Russian/Ukraine war and concerns exist that this may be repeated, which would undermine the rand further,” Investec economist Annabel Bishop said in a research note.


The results from South Africa’s 2022 census, the first in more than ten years and the fourth population and housing survey since apartheid, will be made public on Tuesday by the country’s statistics office.


It is anticipated to provide an in-depth examination of the economy that will boost planning and growth in the most developed economy in Africa.


The data will be the market’s main focus as it provides information on the South African economy and its battle with high unemployment.


The blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange maintained its position, finishing unchanged. The benchmark 2030 government bond for South Africa was less strong; its yield increased by 4 basis points to 10.93%.

West Africa records growth despite coups and underperformance of its largest economies,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic recovery is defined by certain subregions overperforming in comparison to the regional average and others underperforming.

The World Bank relayed the aforementioned information in its Africa’s Pulse bi-annual report. The global lender identified how Africa is doing based on regional performance, which supports its evaluation.


The report shows that while the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the largest economies in Africa such as Nigeria and South Africa have underperformed, regions like the East African Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) are performing better than the regional average in 2023.


The presence of large areas of high development and small areas of low growth that are correlated with economic and political stability (or lack thereof) serves as confirmation of the significant diversity in growth between countries in the region.

More than three-quarters of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa is generated by the ten largest economies, seven of which are expanding at rates that are below their long-term average growth. Sudan, Ghana, and Angola are three of the nations that will do worse in 2023 than they did from 2001-2019 in terms of growth rates.


Nevertheless, development is anticipated to pick up for the majority of nations as the projected annual average growth rate for 2024-25 is greater than that of 2023 for 39 of the region’s 47 countries.


The report also notes that the largest economy in West Africa, Nigeria, is expected to experience a decline in growth from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023.


Nigeria’s “oil production remains below the OPEC+ quota amid capacity issues and lower international oil prices. Non-oil economic activity—particularly industry and services—still supports growth, although policy actions to remove fuel subsidies and unify the exchange rates might be weighing on these activities in the short term,” the report reads in part.

World Bank projects Africas economy to slow down to 2.5%,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic outlook remains bleak amid an elusive growth recovery.
According to the latest World Bank Africa’s Pulse report, rising instability, weak growth in the region’s largest economies, and lingering uncertainty in the global economy are dragging down growth prospects in the region.
Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to decelerate to 2.5% in 2023, from 3.6% in 2022. South Africa’s GDP is expected to only grow by 0.5% in 2023 as energy and transportation bottlenecks continue to bite.



Nigeria and Angola are projected to grow at 2.9% and 1.3% respectively, due to lower international prices and currency pressures affecting oil and non-oil activity.
Increased conflict and violence in the region weigh on economic activity, and this rising fragility may be exacerbated by climatic shocks. In Sudan, economic activity is expected to contract by 12% because of the internal conflict which is halting production, destroying human capital, and crippling state capacity.
In per capita terms, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has not increased since 2015. In fact, the region is projected to contract at an annual average rate per capita of 0.1% over 2015-2025, thus potentially marking a lost decade of growth in the aftermath of the 2014-15 plunge in commodity prices.
“The region’s poorest and most vulnerable people continue to bear the economic brunt of this slowdown, as weak growth translates into slow poverty reduction and poor job growth,” said Andrew Dabalen, World Bank Chief Economist for Africa.
“With up to 12 million young Africans entering the labor market across the region each year, it has never been more urgent for policymakers to transform their economies and deliver growth to people through better jobs.”
Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a few bright spots. Inflation is expected to decline from 9.3% in 2022 to 7.3% in 2023 and fiscal balances are improving in African countries that are pursuing prudent and coordinated macroeconomic policies.
In 2023, the Eastern African community (EAC) is expected to grow by 4.9% while the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is set to grow by 5.1%. However, debt distress remains widespread with 21 countries at high risk of external debt distress or in debt distress as of June 2023.
Overall, current growth rates in the region are inadequate to create enough high-quality jobs to meet increases in the working-age population.
Current growth patterns generate only 3 million formal jobs annually, thus leaving many young people underemployed and engaged in casual, piecemeal, and unstable work that does not make full use of their skills.
Creating job opportunities for the youth will drive inclusive growth and turn the continent’s demographic wealth into an economic dividend.
“The urgency of the jobs challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored by the huge opportunity from demographic transitions that we have seen in other regions,” said Nicholas Woolley, World Bank Economist and contributor to the report.
“This will require an ecosystem that facilitates private-sector development and firm growth, as well as skill development that matches business demand.”
The development of labor-intensive manufacturing seems to be missing in Africa, limiting further effects for the indirect job creation in support services and international trade. This may be partly due to a lack of capital, which continues to hamper the structural transformation required for good quality jobs.
While the region contributes 12% of the global working age population, Sub-Saharan Africa owns only 2% of the global capital stock. This means people have fewer assets with which to be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other regions.
The report identifies a set of policies to overcome hurdles and unleash job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including:
Cost-effective private sector reforms, focused on increasing competition, uniform policy enforcement across firm sizes, and regulatory alignment with regional trading partners.
Governments can also help identify and support early-stage growth of businesses through more inclusive procurement practices and promotion of local businesses abroad.
Investment in education is necessary to boost semi-skilled occupations for the region. Interventions that improve learning in school are more effective than those increasing school attendance alone, while vocational education can be useful for addressing the underemployed and those who have missed out on education as children.
Education of girls and access to jobs for women can reduce potential productivity loss from the misallocation of female labor. Cash transfers have proven effective in increasing girls’ school enrollment and attendance, as well as in curbing pregnancies among school-age girls.

Billion dollar opioid addiction market fuels Nigerias drug crisis,"A growing market of addiction to synthetic opioids estimated at over $1 billion has been identified as the fastest-growing challenge in Nigeria’s drug crisis, apart from cocaine and heroin trafficking.
The emerging challenge is fuelled by the activities of organized crime syndicates that specialize in the production, use, and trafficking of drugs, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS).
With a total of 16 methamphetamine labs seized by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as of 2019, opioid production is aided by the importation of certain chemicals for the local pharmaceutical industry.



“The most important domestic drug market is that of synthetic opioids. The number of consumers is so large that the market is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion annually, likely marking Nigeria’s single highest-value drug market,” the report states.
Most opioid usage is reportedly connected to Tramadol, which comes in pill form. Although not illicit, the wide non-medical use in Nigeria is illegal.


Almost all the tramadol seized in Nigeria in containers between 2011 and 2019 was manufactured in South and Southeast Asia. Ports in Benin Republic and Togo, which often serve as conduits for goods destined for Nigeria, also seize large volumes of the drug.
Following the import and production ban of codeine cough syrup in Nigeria in 2018, it is likely that supplies are being diverted from neighboring countries, the report said.
Prices of tramadol in Nigeria rose five-fold between 2017 and 2021. Moreover, Nigeria remains a hub in the transnational cocaine and heroin trade, with cocaine coming from Latin America using Nigeria and neighboring countries as a transit hub also a matter of concern. Most cocaine couriered into Nigeria today comes from São Paolo (Brazil) through Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to Cotonou (Benin Republic) or Lagos (Nigeria).
While Nigeria has a system in place to limit the distribution of controlled medicines to licensed pharmacists, it appears to be widely disregarded. As one group of academics observed
Much of the cannabis produced is consumed locally, while most of the methamphetamine produced seems to be exported.
A prisoner interviewed by UNODC for the report explaining the details of his role as a recruiter of labour for a cannabis plantation said he recruited dozens of boys from his community who were transported by bus to work for a year on cannabis fields in another state.

The boys were paid N120,000 naira for one year’s work after their living costs had been deducted. Some of the boys used these funds to buy cannabis to sell in the city.
In this way, part of the distribution network proceeded organically from the cultivation operation.
One survey of communities in Bayelsa State found that “the typical cultivator was a wealthy or a rich man with a strong network and connections with government officials.”
One cultivator interviewed in prison by UNODC described a 50-member association of farmers with democratically elected officers to represent their common interests, including protection from law enforcement.
The chairman of this group was said to be a person of considerable social and financial influence.
The cultivator interviewed claimed to net N2 million (about $5,000) per year.
Citing the NDLEA, the report shows that cannabis sold for between N40,000 and N50,000 naira for a 50-kilogram bag in 2015 and N25,000 for a 25-kilogram bag in 2016.
Although there has been considerable seasonal variation, with dry season prices rising to N80, 000 per bag.
On the low end, this is about $100 for 50 kilograms, or one-fifth of one US cent per gram, suggesting a low-quality, low-investment bulk product.

The relatively cheap product can generate significant profits for the people who work in the market.
Distributors reported purchasing large volumes of cannabis and reselling them for two or three times the purchase price. One female prisoner, who bought from a source and sold to urban retailers, reported getting a loan for this purpose from a registered microfinance bank in Nigeria.

Nigeria aims for $5 billion tech investment by 2027,"Nigeria is setting its sights on attracting $5 billion in annual tech startup investments by 2027, unveiling a strategic plan to bolster the local tech ecosystem and foster innovation.
Dr. Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, announced this ambitious goal as part of the country’s broader plan to accelerate its digital economy.
In a report titled “Accelerating our Collective Prosperity through Technical Efficiency: A Strategic Plan for the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation & Digital Economy,” Dr. Tijani highlighted the pivotal role of innovation, entrepreneurship, and access to financing in the global tech landscape. He emphasized the ministry’s commitment to nurturing startups, particularly those pioneering groundbreaking solutions across key economic sectors, Business Insider Africa reported.



Acknowledging the importance of patient capital in startup growth, the minister stated that the ministry aims to boost the availability of such capital locally. The objective is to create an environment conducive to startups raising the necessary funds to thrive within Nigeria, ultimately encouraging more startups to establish themselves in the country.
To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, Dr. Tijani outlined a clear target: “Increase capital raised by Nigerian tech startups 50 percent year-on-year from ~$1 billion/yr in 2022 to $5 billion/yr in 2027.”
Furthermore, the ministry plans to establish an active sandbox environment to inspire and empower entrepreneurs and innovators to devise specialized solutions for industries that have had limited exposure to technological advancements.
Nigeria also aims to substantially boost the domiciliation of local tech startups, with a target of increasing it from less than 1 percent to 25 percent by 2027. This move is expected to enhance the startups’ contributions to the Nigerian economy significantly.
Dr. Tijani stressed the growing significance of digital transformation and innovation as drivers of economic progress. He underscored the unique opportunity presented by the intersection of a robust digital economy and Nigeria’s innovative and youthful population, envisioning a path toward prosperity, inclusivity, and global relevance.

Punitive domestic tariffs threaten African trade,"Tariff and non-tariff barriers in the country remain a real threat to the vision of a liberalised African trade market under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
This is despite the fact that Ghana’s legal framework supports free trade, says a study that revealed tariff barriers are imposed as taxes and duties on imports – while non-tariff barriers (NTBs) encompass protectionist policies against foreign trade.
Combined, it said, they threaten the idea of a free continental free trade market.



Under the AFCFTA’s mandate for gradually reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers, Ghana is expected to liberalise tariffs over ten years and remove non-tariff barriers.
“Removing these restrictions will significantly increase trade within African countries,” says the study dubbed— Situational analysis of Ghana’s AFCFTA preparedness: a review of the legal, policy and regulatory Framework for implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA in Ghana).
Produced by Ishmael Yamson & Associates and Sam Okudzeto & Associates on behalf of the University of Professional Studies-Accra (UPSA) Law School, the report underscores the necessity of addressing certain challenges within the domestic legal framework to enhance the AfCFTA’s implementation.
These challenges encompass the absence of harmonisation in laws, regulations and standards across the continent.
The report suggests the country should strive to align its laws with those of other African nations to facilitate the smooth movement of goods and services across borders.
Furthermore, it highlights that insufficient funding for policy implementation, coupled with a deficiency in the necessary skills for policy execution – along with issues such as transparency deficits, inconsistent and overlapping regulations and a centralised and costly bureaucratic system – pose significant challenges.
These challenges make enforcement difficult, and compliance confusing and costly; further impeding the country’s effective participation in the free trade area.
Ghana must excel in AfCFTA implementation
In response to the report, Dr. Fareed Arthur, Head-National AfCFTA Coordination Office, expressed gratitude to UPSA Law School and the authors for their extensive work.
He also mentioned that while he appreciates the report, there are certain points on which he holds differing opinions.
“Depending on where and what you are looking at, the issue of preparedness comes out differently. It [AfCFTA] is a new experiment. We are still negotiating parts of the World Trade Organisation protocols even after its existence for over 50 years. In these agreements, you can never be entirely prepared because it’s an ongoing and evolving process.  AfCFTA is not a one-time event that you prepare for and then simply sit,” said Dr. Arthur.
With that said, he believes the study’s findings will contribute to the government’s efforts in harnessing the benefits which AfCFTA bring, saying: “The narrative is that Ghana consistently perceives itself as a leading force in the political liberation of this continent. We believe that AfCFTA represents the economic frontier, and as such Ghana must excel in its implementation”.
AfCTA must never fail
The commencement of AfCFTA creates the world’s largest free trade area, encompassing the most countries in its reach.
This historic pact links 55 countries, uniting 1.3 billion people and boasting a collective gross domestic product (GDP) valued at US$ 3.4 trillion.
Moreover, it holds the promise of uplifting 30 million individuals from extreme poverty. However, realising its full potential hinges on the implementation of substantial policy reforms and the facilitation of trade.
Deputy Trade and Industry Minister, Michael Okyere Baafi – who launched the report, emphasised that the concept of free trade on the continent is not only a game-changer but also an opportunity for Africans to discover and leverage the potential of Africa to their advantage.
He also envisions this development as a means to transform the African continent into a place that is regarded as the best in the world by everyone.
“We are exploring Africa to see the opportunities available. So, let’s make sure that Africans take advantage of all the opportunities available in Africa. This is the way to make the continent rich and avoid travelling to the West for loans,” he said.
“So, we cannot fail. It’s important that as a country we strive to ensure this concept [AfCFTA] works, as host of the secretariat. It must never be allowed to fail,” he added.

"Ofori-Atta commends G20 for AUs inclusion, urges common voice","The Minister for Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta says Africa now has the opportunity to contribute to key global issues and push for common interests that would help accelerate economic development in the region.
Mr. Ofori-Atta’s optimism follows the recent inclusion of the African Union in the Group of 20 most important industrialized and developing economies, also known as the G20. It becomes the second regional bloc to join the group after the European Union.
‘There had been several decisions taken without Africa on the board and thank God the G20 agreed that Africa will have a seat so we will be part of the designing the solutions to our Global challenges,’’ the Finance Minister said.



He was speaking at a panel on the Energy Transition Accelerator organized by the Rockefeller Foundation on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly.
The minister added that the inclusion is long overdue, hoping that it will create a balance in global institutions.
The Group of 20
The G20 was formed as an informal group in 1999 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, providing a platform for finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 of the world’s largest and emerging economies. It later included heads of state and governments.
The group has since widened its scope beyond finance and economics, adding some of the world’s pressing challenges to its agenda. It includes health, climate change, food security, energy and sustainable development.
‘Our admission provides another opportunity to push for accelerated reforms in the global financial system to ensure developing nations are treated fairly,’ Mr Ofori-Atta said.
Until the admission of the African Union as a permanent member, the 19-member group jointly accounted for more than 80% of global productivity, 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world’s population.
Despite Africa joining the group with 3% of global economic output, the 55 member states come with a population of 1.3 billion people, largely in their youthful and productive stages of life.
The continent is aggressively pushing for inclusion at all international tables where decisions that affect its people are taken.
The Finance Minister said Africa will come with common positions on issues of international concern, especially the ones that affect the continent the most.
‘Africa will speak with one voice to ensure we make good use of our membership to help realize the aspirations of our people,’ Mr Ofori-Atta stated.",citibusinessnews,"Africa, Featured","September 21, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/ofori-atta-commends-g20-for-aus-inclusion-urges-common-voice/
Ofori-Atta lauds establishment of independent secretariat to achieve climate prosperity,"The Minister for Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta has disclosed that, the decision to establish an Independent Secretariat for Climate Vulnerable Forum and the V20 Group of Finance Ministers was a giant step towards achieving climate prosperity objectives.
The Minister, who is the Chair of the V20 – the Finance Ministers of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, made these remarks at a high-level leader’s meeting during the 2023 United Nations General Assembly.
The meeting was under the theme “Advancing Climate Prosperity, Building a Resilient Global Financial Architecture for the Climate Vulnerable’’.



The establishment of an independent Secretariat, the Minister said, would ensure that the coalition has a legal form that would facilitate the mobilisation of more resources to support member states in the development and implementation of their climate prosperity goals.
He added that, it would also ensure the provision of policy guidance, facilitation of access to financial resources for adaptation and loss and damage, build the capacity of member states, and empower them to effectively navigate challenges posed by climate change.
‘’Like all grand endeavours, if we are to become more effective and reach our full potential, our growing initiatives will need a structured coherent organization with a crystal-clear mandate and the clarity of a forward-looking vision’’ he said.
According to him, the combined voice of the 68 Member States of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, representing over 1.7 billion people, is not just impressive in number but powerful in intent to drive and realize deeper global transformation.
Mr. Ofori-Atta was optimistic that the membership of the Forum would increase from 68 to 100 countries by the end of COP 28, to represent about 30 percent of the world’s population.
The Minister further noted that, the approach to establish an independent Secretariat for the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the V20 Finance Ministers was a milestone and described it as “the coming of age of a formidable entity designed to sustain and amplify the efforts of our nations, to protect us from climate impacts, expand our adaptive capacity and enable us rise beyond our climate vulnerabilities’’.
This he underscored, would provide a more formidable voice and intent on their advocacy for a Just Energy Transition, protect economies of climate vulnerable countries from Climate impacts, scale-up Accessibility Finance with urgency and also ensure debt sustainability.
The President of the Republic of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo who is the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, CVF in his address conveyed the sympathy and solidarity of the group to the people of Morocco and Libya.
‘’As we struggle to overcome the combined stress of climate change and debt, it is important to remind ourselves that what binds us is more than our collective vulnerabilities and it is our capabilities that define us and our readiness to confront together our existential threat that set us apart’’ he stated.
According to the Chair of the CVF, a new deal on carbon financing was essential to achieve the Paris Agreement in the near term and underscored the need to strengthen the 2030 climate target for major polluting economies and the encourage ambitious positive climate action in low emitting developing economies.
The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, H.E Amina J. Mohammed stressed on the need to acknowledge the leadership and ingenuity of the Climate Vulnerable nations which often bear the disproportionate burden of the climate crisis.
She regretted that, developing economies and vulnerable countries were severely hampered by debilitating debt burden, limited fiscal space, and high borrowing cost and highlighted that the solution to the difficulties was the formation of a robust global financial architecture.
Following that, the Deputy Secretary-General urged stakeholders, multilateral institutions, government leaders, businesses, civil society organisations, and individuals to join in the creation of a more resilient global financial architecture that would enable nations to thrive in a more prosperous and resilient world.
The Prime Minister for Barbados, Her Excellency Mia Amor Mottley also stated that, if ever there was a need for a group that was focused on vulnerability in a strategic way, this was the time and gave assurance of her country’s full commitment to working with all others in a way that shaped the organisation.
She further advised on the need to adopt country ownership of the transition strategies to facilitate the transition to low carbon economies, enable us realise our Nationally Determined Contributions and ultimately maintain the 1.5-degree temperature threshold.
The Prime Minister also officially indicated Barbados’s willingness to Chair the Forum after Ghana’s tenure ends in May 2024.

Access Bank pledges support for Ghanas Pharmaceutical Society,"Access Bank Ghana has reaffirmed its strong support for the pharmaceutical industry in Ghana during the Bank’s Distributors’ Forum held at the Labadi Beach Hotel in Accra.
The event, co-organized by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana and the Business and Financial Times, brought together over 200 participants and eight industry experts from various fields to discuss key issues impacting the pharmaceutical sector’s growth in the country.
The theme of the forum was ‘Building a sustainable pharmaceutical business in Ghana,’ and James Bruce, the Executive Director for Wholesale Banking at Access Bank Ghana, expressed the bank’s commitment to making a positive impact beyond traditional banking services.



‘We want to impact the entire value chain with skills, financial advisory, and traditional banking services to enable them to navigate the times.’ James added that the Bank has gained much experience in running sustainable businesses through its exposure to diverse markets in Africa, therefore well-equipped to provide the pharmaceutical industry with its financial needs. ‘We provide cross border trade within Africa at cheaper rates because we are present in 12 African countries, with our expansion into two new African markets through our acquisition of Standard Chartered Bank in Tanzania and Angola.’
Commenting on why the Bank chose the pharmaceutical industry, James said Access Bank’s interest in the pharmaceutical industry also stems from the Bank’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)3, which focuses on good health and well-being.

He touched on skills the industry needs to succeed such as excellent customer service and leveraging technology in this digital era and pledged their commitment to offer the industry space in their newspaper to educate people on pertinent subjects through the publication of articles.
The President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana, Dr Samuel Donkor, said the collaboration forms part of their strategy to help Pharmacists to own businesses, especially in an era where employment opportunities from government and private employers have dwindled. ‘When Pharmacists have their own pharmaceutical businesses, hard-to-reach areas can also be covered with healthcare, as pharmacies remain the first point of call for many patients’. He thanked Access Bank for the opportunity it has offered to support the pharmaceutical industry and young pharmacists to own pharmacies.
Chief Executive Officers of AlphaDelta Pharmacy and TopUp Pharmacy shared insights into ‘Owning successful community pharmacies’ and ‘The community pharmacy as a business.’ They touched on the importance of knowing and educating one’s market appropriately, with current trends in health-related issues, providing services beyond traditional pharmacy, maintaining a wide range of stock, and record keeping among others.

Make decisions to mitigate activities on environment- Business leaders charged,"Business leaders are being charged to make decisions that will mitigate the negative impact of their activities on the environment.
The Dean of the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) Business School, Professor Samuel Famiyeh believes that although the core aim of every business is to make profits, business owners should also consider the adverse effects their activities could have on the environment.
Prof. Samuel Famiyeh noted that, businesses risk not getting raw materials for production if environmental degradation persists.



He was speaking on the sidelines of his inaugural lecture delivered at the GIMPA Business School on the theme: “Environmental Practices, operational competitiveness and environmental performance: empirical evidence from a developing country’’.
“With businesses, you need those resources to be produced. If you explore them and they are in extinction, there is no way that you will even get resources. You will even suffer. You will not be able to produce. If you prioritize sustainable development, you will be able to grow for a long time”, he noted.
He urged business leaders to employ additional hands at their various workplaces to plan and integrate environmental programmes in their businesses.
“When you are a manager and you want to take decisions about sustainability, you hire someone, pay him to make sure that whatever I do, I integrate that. Like I said I am the light green type. Make your money but not pollute too much and not at the expense of the society”, Prof. Famiyeh noted.",citibusinessnews,,"June 21, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/06/make-decisions-to-mitigate-activities-on-environment-business-leaders-charged/

Stakeholders in the maritime sector urged to sustain competiveness for youth,"Stakeholders within the maritime space are being urged to sustain the competiveness of the sector to ensure that the teeming youth on the African Continent find ready jobs in the industry.

Dr. Baboucarr Njie believes there are available jobs within the maritime sector and young people who studied maritime related courses and training would be guaranteed immediate employment.

He said that: Though, other courses could be essential and provide solutions to some developmental challenges, the maritime sector had become very attractive, required a lot of personnel to drive the sector and Ghanaian youth must take advantage of the opportunities.
“RMU, the premium maritime education institution in the sub-region, had positioned itself to provide the needed support for the youth to acquire the needed skills and be gainfully employed after graduation,” he added.

Idris Elba adds Ghana to the list of African countries he wants to partner with,"The celebrated British actor Idris Elba, recently met with the president of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House, during his visit to Ghana.

In a video from their meeting that has gone viral on social media, Idris Elba was seen pitching the idea of establishing a film studio in the west African country.


He noted that there is a lot of filmmaking potential that the lack of facilities has stifled. He also spoke about the importance of government policies in boosting the film sector in Africa.


“We’ve studied the models of obviously South Africa’s incredible incentive package, and around Europe, obviously, Greece, Morocco, these are all places where they realize the value of the filmmaking dollar and have brought that policy into play,” he said to the Ghanaian president.


The blockbuster actor revealed that he has a movie he is currently shooting and would love to shoot some parts of that movie in Ghana. He disclosed that pre-production is set for August, and principal photography would begin in December.


He also told the Ghanaian president that he intends for this film to be a proof of concept. “It would be very beneficial for us to show and to make an announcement to the world that Ghana is open for business, here are the steps, the policies are in place and we have actually, bringing a film to our country, and we are going to put our money where our mouth is.”


This new development is coming less than a week after the news broke that Idris Elba intends to build a film studio in Tanzania. Read the story here.


Idris, who has both a Ghanaian and Sierre Leonean lineage, has been keen on developing the film market in Africa. So much so that he has starred in movies that directly tell of some of Africa’s struggles including, Beast of no Nation and Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. Also, Universal Pictures filmed the entirety of the movie Beast in South Africa in 2021, with Idris as the lead actor.


Africa’s market potential is a subject he has not shied away from as he continues to use his platform to highlight this topic.


He spoke about Africa’s immense market potential at a fireside talk at the 2022 US-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington D.C., saying that its status as the world’s fastest developing market makes it ripe for new waves of innovative companies to be established.
