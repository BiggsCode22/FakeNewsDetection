Investing in innovators to unlock limitless opportunities,"For the first time, I have a clear direction for my innovation. I learned how to approach problems in a structured way and set achievable goals to help grow my innovation, said Mark Sarfo, participant from the Young Africa Innovates (YAI) programme pilot BootCamp.

Mark is a young Ghanaian innovator who is passionate about finding solutions to tackle challenges in his community in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. But, like many others, he faced a major hurdle - lack of guidance and support- until he joined the Young Africa Innovates (YAI) programme.

The bootcamp connected me to great experts who have given me the tools and confidence to turn my ideas into reality, and Im excited as this will greatly impact my business and help me make a meaningful difference in my community Mark added.

The YAI programme aims to empower marginalized youth, especially women, persons living in rural communities, and persons with disabilities, to turn their ideas into reality.

Through the YAI pilot bootcamp organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ghana, the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), and other partners, Mark including other innovators gained access to expert training and mentorship. He learned how to refine his innovation and build a successful business.

Addressing the innovators during the pilot bootcamp, the YAI Programme Chief Technical Advisor, Allen Anie, stated that At UNDP, we believe that every young person has the potential to drive positive change, regardless of their gender, location, or background. That is why the YAI programme is designed to support those who are marginalized and provide them with the resources and support they need to succeed, he stated.

Lydia Takyi, an Entrepreneurship/Career and Employability Coach at the pilot bootcamp shares her excitement as she reflected on the innovators' progress, saying, I was happy to see how quickly they grabbed the concepts and adapted to the design thinking approach. Their ability to think creatively, and develop innovative solutions was truly impressive. It's clear that these young innovators have the potential to drive meaningful change in their communities and beyond, Lydia expressed. 

Director of Business Support and Policy at National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), Franklin Owusu-Karikari noted that, Unlocking the potential of young innovators is crucial for Ghana's economic growth and development, and NEIP remains committed to working with its partners to provide the necessary support and resources to help the innovators succeed.""

With the support of UNDP and the Mastercard Foundation, YAI is paving the way for a brighter future for Ghana's youth, providing a platform for innovators like Mark to thrive. 

As the bootcamps progress, the stories and successes of these young innovators will continue to be shared, highlighting the transformative power of inclusive innovation.

"Asantes are courageous, decisive and contributes to national development - Asantehene to US Consul General","Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has described the people of Ashanti as courageous, dedicated, and industrious individuals who contribute significantly to national development.

 According to the Asantehene, Asantes are known for their bravery, decisive decision-making, and strong work ethic, which makes them successful in every endeavor.

 ""Asantes are very courageous and decisive in their decisions; they are industrious, making them successful in every life endeavor,"" he said.

 He highlighted self-employment as a key aspect of Asante culture, with many engaging in farming, particularly cocoa production, and historically, a thriving timber industry.

Otumfuo Osei Tutu II made these remarks when the American Consul General in Ghana, Elliot Fertik, paid a courtesy call on him at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi on Friday, June 21, 2024.

 The visit marked the Consul's first encounter with the people of Asanteman, and he congratulated the Asantehene on his 25 years on the Golden Stool.

Plot to attack Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade uncovered,"The Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade has reported that landguards working for an unnamed estate developer within Adoagyiri and Okanta have planned a reprisal attack against them.

 The brigade intercepted the plot in a voice recording on a certain WhatsApp platform.

 Addressing the media at Kyebi over the weekend, Okyeman Akwansrahene Baffour Asiedu Bekoe stated that the land guards, posing as police informants, are part of a syndicate terrorizing farmers and landowners in Okanta and its surrounding areas.

 He explained that the Environmental Protection Brigade received reports of land guards terrorizing residents of Okanta, arrested them, and handed them over to the police at Kyebi.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe noted that the police released the suspects after 48 hours and then conspired to attack members of the Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade.

 The Okyeman Akwansrahene revealed that the land guards circulated pictures of the brigade's leaders on a WhatsApp platform, inciting their members to target them.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe has reported the plot to the police, which is currently under investigation.

 This incident follows the killing of 28-year-old Ofei Noah, a member of the brigade, who was murdered two months ago.

 Noah was killed, and three brigade members sustained multiple gunshot wounds while returning from their usual patrol around Adeiso. They were ambushed in a nearby village.

 Ofei Noah was laid to rest over the weekend.

 Meanwhile, Baffour Asiedu Bekoe asserts that the Environmental Protection Brigade will not be intimidated by the threats and will not abandon its duty to protect Okyeman's property.

 He declared that all lands from Adoagyiri to Jejeti, Dome Faase, Asamankese, Adeiso, and their environs remain the property of the Overlord of the Akyem Abuakwa State, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin.

 As a result, any transfer of lands without the consent and agreement of the Okyenhene is invalid.

 He advised all parties who have acquired lands from third parties to visit the Okyeman Stool Lands secretariat at Kyebi to regularize their documents or face consequences.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe urged security agencies to assist in curbing the landguard problem in the area.

 He affirmed that the Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade was founded to safeguard Okyeman's property, and they are committed to this mission.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Plot-to-attack-Okyeman-Environmental-Protection-Brigade-uncovered-1938040
Accra Durbar of Chiefs: Youth urged to embrace peace,"Prominent chiefs and political party representatives gathered at Sabon Zongo, a suburb of Accra, to mark this year's Greater Accra Zongo Durbar of Chiefs with a common call on the youth to embrace peace ahead of the December elections.

The durbar aims to bring together Muslim tribal chiefs, traditional chiefs, queen mothers, politicians, and youth from all walks of life with the purpose of promoting peace ahead of the December 7, 2024 elections, as well as raising funds for the construction of Islamic schools in the Sabon Zongo community.

The durbar, themed ""Ensuring Peaceful Elections in December 2024: The Role of the Youth and Traditional Leaders,"" was held under the auspices of the Greater Accra Zongo Chief, Dr. Sarki Alhaji Yahaya Hamisu Bako.

Alhaji Abdul Jalil Abubakar, the chairman of the Greater Accra durbar committee, in an interview with the media on the sidelines of the durbar, called on the youth to make peace their topmost priority ahead of the December polls.

He urged the youth to consider children and women before engaging in any form of violence before, during, and after the elections, adding that children and women suffer the most during any conflict.

He said there is a need to promote peace and say no to politics or any form of violence in the country.

He advised his fellow youth not to allow themselves to be used as tools for political violence and urged them to be bold and reject any offer from politicians who may come to them to commit crimes.

The Development Queen Mother of Osu Ashante, Manye Naa Odofeley Wornor I, who was represented by Sherifatu Abdulahi, used the opportunity to call on mothers to advise their children on the need to promote peace.

According to her, mothers have some form of influence on their children; hence, there is a need for mothers to add their voices to the call for peace before, during, and after the December elections.

She revealed that most politicians have enrolled their children in universities abroad to become better people but turned around to use the ordinary Ghanaian youth during elections for their political gains.

She, therefore, called on mothers to advise their children not to engage in any form of violence for the benefit of politicians.

Manye Naa Odofeley Wornor I donated an amount of GHC 500 for the construction of madrasas (Islamic school projects) in Sabon Zongo, Accra.", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Accra-Durbar-of-Chiefs-Youth-urged-to-embrace-peace-1938038
NSS saves GHC112 million through IT infrastructure,"Under the leadership of its current director, Mr. Osei Asibbey Antwi, the National Service Scheme (NSS) has saved Ghana over GHC122 million through IT infrastructure.

Why the Asantehene bathes with water from the River Tano once every year  Obiri Boahen,"Did you know that every Asantehene is supposed to have a ritual bath with water from the Tano River, which flows for 400 kilometers from Traa in the Bono East Region to the Aby Lagoon in Ivory Coast, once every year?

Lawyer Nana Obiri Boahen, in an interview with the Xpress Media Network, explained the history behind this ritual.

He shared that every Asantehene in the Ashanti Kingdom has bathed with water from the River Tano once every year since 1717, and the water must come from a specific section of the river - Tano Obuasi.

He mentioned that the ritual originated after it was discovered that the river possessed a powerful force when communities along the river aided the Ashantis in winning the 1717 war.

""When the Ashantis were preparing to fight the Jameriwa war in 1717, the people of Tepa, Buadeduro, Tanoso, Tsumpuduo, Tano, Boatsiniwa, all supported the Ashantis.

""Therefore, since 1717, anyone who holds the title of Asanteman is required to bathe with water from the Tano River once every year. They collect water from the river for him to use, and they fetch it from Tano Obuasi,"" he explained in Twi.

He noted that the river contains powerful spirits, and only at its banks in Tano Obuasi can curses from potent deities be reversed.

""The River Tano holds a spirit. It is even challenging to see the river alongside Bosomtwe... if someone curses you with Antoa and you wish to reverse it, you can only do so at Tano Obuasi,"" he emphasized.

Dont kill yourselves as a way to find solutions to address problems  Minister,"Mr. Stephen Yakubu, the Upper West Regional Minister, has described as worrying and abnormal the actions of people who kill one another to address problems with their neighbors.

""There is no need to kill one another; the elders are there, the security agencies are there, and the law courts are there to help address disputes and misunderstandings amicably without the shedding of blood,"" he said.

He stated that it was always better for the people in the communities to work together to sustain peace and explore pragmatic ways and means to address conditions of poverty, which had over the years plagued them and hindered their overall well-being and development, rather than killing themselves at the least provocation.

Mr. Yakubu raised these concerns at separate meetings with the traditional rulers and the youth of Wechiau, Kandeu, and Lassia in the Wa West District to share his sympathies and listen to them following the killing of three young men at Lassia during a communal clash between the people of Kandeu and Lassia communities on June 15, 2024.

He said poverty should be considered the common and topmost enemy of the people and that it was only through peaceful co-existence and ensuring a conducive environment that they could work to overcome poverty and underdevelopment.

""Problems are always with us on a daily basis, but we need to continually sit and dialogue to find amicable solutions to them, rather than killing ourselves as a way of solving them,"" he said.

""You must know what conflict does to the people and what peace also does to the people. The difference between them is that conflict is a threat to human existence, while peace is the lifewire of human development and well-being,"" he added.

Mr. Yakubu pleaded with the traditional authorities, especially the chiefs and the landlords, to engage with stakeholders to work assiduously to resolve all issues pertaining to land and chieftaincy disputes in the area, as that had been a bone of contention that ignited the clashes between the two communities.

He advised the youth to be law-abiding and avoid associating the clashes with politics, as that could aggravate the situation and derail the peace processes ""since this is an election year.""

The Regional Minister warned that any agitator who would want to escalate the issues to achieve his or her selfish interest would not be spared by the security agencies on the ground.

He also assured the bereaved families that the perpetrators of the murder of the three persons would be made to face the full rigors of the law.

Naa Imoru Nandon Gomah, the Paramount Chief of the Wechiau Traditional Council, commended the security agencies for their professionalism that had returned peace to the district.

He assured Mr. Yakubu and the security agencies of the Council's unflinching support to ensure peace to enable the people to go about their farming activities and other businesses in the area.

The Wechiau Naa appealed to the Regional Police Command to release the dead bodies to the bereaved families on time for burial to help cool down tempers.

He requested an increase in the number of security personnel on the burial day of the deceased to take care of any unforeseen disturbances.",,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Don-t-kill-yourselves-as-a-way-to-find-solutions-to-address-problems-Minister-1937990

Watch how immigration officers allegedly brutalised a Ghanaian because he was 'white' but had a Ghana Card,"A group of officers from the Ghana Immigration Service allegedly subjected Ghanaian, Michael Cham, whom they believed to be an 'alien' due to his white skin colour, to severe beatings in Mim, a community in the Ahafo Region.

 According to a report by Kofi TV, the immigration officers, who appeared to have been monitoring the man, confronted him while he was shopping at a mall.

 The officers questioned Michael Cham about his nationality, to which he responded affirmatively and showed them his Ghana Card as proof.

 Despite this, they attempted to arrest him, claiming he was a foreigner who had illegally obtained the Ghana Card, the country's National Identification Card.

 Cham resisted the arrest, maintaining that he was Ghanaian, which escalated into a confrontation in the shopping mall.

 CCTV footage of the incident depicts the man struggling with the officers, with one of them delivering a heavy blow to his face.

 The officers eventually removed Cham from the mall, leaving him with blood streaming down his face.

 According to Kofi TV's Kofi Adoma Nwanwani, their investigation revealed that Michael Cham is a Ghanaian with a Ghanaian mother and an expatriate father.

 He belongs to a well-known family in Mim that owns the Desmond Saw Mill.

Asantehene cannot leave Asante to come and install a paramount chief in Fiapre - Sunyani West chiefs fume,"The Odumase No.1 Traditional Council in the Sunyani West Municipality of the Bono Region is reportedly furious over the decision of the Fiaprehene, Obrempong Professor Kyem Amponsah II, to join the Asanteman Traditional Council.

The Sunyani West chiefs argue that the Fiaprehene cannot join the Asanteman Council because he is settling on their land.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, June 28, 2024, the Kontirehene of Odumase No. 1, Nana Godlove Kwaku Boateng, said that Odumase was not one of the lands conquered by the Ashanti Kingdom and therefore Asantehene cannot install a paramount chief on their land.

He issued a strong warning to Fiaprehene Kyem Amponsah II, cautioning him against joining the Asanteman Council and added that the chief can leave their land if he wishes.

He can leave for any town he wishes. He can serve anybody he wants. But he cannot take our property because he came to meet our land, which belongs to our ancestors. He should leave our land because it is for the children of Fiapre.

I spoke to our family head and he agreed with me that the Asantehene cannot leave Asante and install a paramount chief in Fiapre because when he (the Fiaprehene) needed land to settle on, it was his (the family head's) father who gave him the land. And so no one can live on his fathers land and serve another person, he said in Twi.

He added, You (Fiaprehene) are saying you are your own man and you can do what you want. But our land does not belong to the Asantehene. Odumase is not one of the lands conquered by the Asante.

On her part, the Ohemaa of Odumase No. 1, Nana Yaa Adansi Puduo II, slammed the Fiaprehene over his action.

She said that the chief was ungrateful for his decision to join the Asanteman Council because it was the chief and people of Odumase who gave his ancestors land to settle on when they had nowhere to go.

Tension erupts at Abundant Life Assemblies of God Church over induction of new pastor,"Tensions are rising at the Abundant Life Assemblies of God Church in Bohyen-Adumanu, Kumasi, as some members protest against the induction of a new pastor to lead the branch.

The protest, which took place on June 23, 2024, at the church premises, has gone viral on social media. 

According to reports, the congregation wants Associate Pastor Rev. Bismark Opoku, whose mandate expired in 2023, to be appointed as the new head pastor.

This demand emerged after the Assemblies of God Ashanti West failed to resolve the issue, prompting Abundant Life Assemblies of God to petition the General Council. After deliberations, the General Council appointed a new head pastor. 

In resolving the issue, the leadership of Assemblies of God Ashanti West referred to Section 11, 6 of the Constitution and Bye-Laws of Assemblies of God, Ghana, which states: ""The services of an Associate or Assistant shall end when the services of the Pastor-in-charge cease; subject, however, to his re-engagement at the discretion of the incoming pastor and the District Pastor.""

However, the church members argued that as stakeholders, their views should be respected, and Rev. Bismark Opoku should be maintained as the head pastor.

Meanwhile, the church leadership has called for calm at a press conference.

""If you visit the various SHSs, it is bad. The wee toffee is common among the students. Where they get them, one can't tell, but these learners are consuming these substances like there is no tomorrow, and I think authorities ought to strengthen efforts that can curtail this growing behavior amongst the learners,"" he stated.

Speaking on A1 Radio during a segment aimed at raising awareness for World Drug Day, Mr. Atambire made an urgent appeal to school authorities and relevant stakeholders to implement concrete measures to address this issue.

He emphasized the need for increased vigilance and proactive interventions to either eradicate or significantly reduce the production and consumption of these substances in and around school premises.

Mr. Atambire's comments highlight a critical issue facing many educational institutions in the region.

The growing trend of ""wee toffee"" consumption amongst SHS students, he said, is a call to action for parents, educators, and policymakers to prioritize the health and safety of learners",,Regional, 29 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Wee-toffee-becoming-popular-among-SHS-students-in-Upper-East-Region-1937909

Lets be mindful of our responsibilities in conflict situations  Wa West District Chief Imam,"Imam Iddrisu Abdulai Ahlusunna Waljama'a, District Chief Imam of Wa West, has cautioned all communities living with conflicts in the district to be mindful of their responsibilities instead of focusing only on their rights.

""Yes, you have the right, but you equally have the responsibility. Oftentimes, people only look at their rights while neglecting their responsibility, which is the reason why conflicts always escalate,"" he said.

Imam Abdulai, who is also the Wa West District Director for Complementary Education, was speaking in an interview on the sidelines of a two-day training program for traditional and religious leaders on conflict resolution, negotiations, and confidence building for effective conflict management in the community.

The training is part of a three-year project being implemented by the National Peace Council across the Upper West, Upper East, and North-East Regions with sponsorship from the UN Peacebuilding Fund in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).

The Wa West District Chief Imam pointed out that knowing the rights and responsibilities would often result in taking the right decisions and approaches to resolving misunderstandings and preventing them from escalating.

""So, if we were able to know that this is our right and this is our responsibility, some of these issues would not have happened at all,"" he said.

He thanked the Peace Council for drawing their attention to the aspect of responsibility in conflict situations, stressing, ""I am impressed with this program, and I wish I had this training earlier; maybe I would have been able to impart the knowledge to many other people.""

""I learned that when there's a conflict, everybody has their own view about the issue, and to be able to understand them, you need to put yourself in the person's position,"" he indicated.

Imam Abdulai also called for patience at all times, emotional control, and speaking the truth in times of misunderstanding.

He appealed to the Peace Council and its partners to extend the training to cover all the communities in the Wa West District.

Bushira Sakara, a Women's Group Leader, emphasised the need for peace to reign in the various communities and appealed to the youth to endeavor to exercise patience in misunderstandings.",,Regional, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Let-s-be-mindful-of-our-responsibilities-in-conflict-situations-Wa-West-District-Chief-Imam-1937867

No mercy for any fisherman who engages in illegal fishing - Hawa Koomson,"The Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD), Mavis Hawa Koomson, has said the Ministry will not countenance any illegal fishing activities in Ghana.

 According to her, the Ministry will deal decisively with fishers found culpable of flouting laws regulating the fishing industry and those engaged in illegal fishing activities.

 She warned artisanal fishermen, tuna vessels, and trawlers engaging in or intending to engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the four coastal regions of the country to stop the practice or face her wrath.

 The Minister was speaking during a day's working visit to the Volta Region for an engagement with stakeholders in the fishing industry ahead of the planned 2024 closed season starting July 1.

 Hawa Koomson said the fishing infractions, aside from the negative impacts of unfair competition, depletion of the fish stock, destruction of the marine ecosystem, and, by extension, livelihoods of fisherfolk, had implications on human health, hence the need for such culprits to be made to face the law.

 The Minister explained that closed seasons had nothing to do with politics but were a measure to replenish the fish stock to avert the possible collapse of the fishing industry due to depleted stock.

 She commended fishers in the Volta Region for their law-abiding nature, saying the region was ranked the best in adhering to laws regulating the industry, and urged them not to rest on their oars in holding onto that enviable position.

 The newly appointed Deputy Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) and Member of Parliament (MP) for the Mion Constituency, Abdul-Aziz Ayaba Musah, who was part of the visiting team, implored the fishers to strictly obey fishing laws and to observe the 2024 closed season, which he said was for their benefit.

 Deputy Volta Regional Chief Fisherman, Torgbi Seth Agbo-Kedey, speaking on the sidelines of the meeting, also highlighted the immense benefits of closed seasons, saying the benefits far outweighed the disadvantages.

 He pledged to work together with all chief fishermen at the various beaches to ensure that the 2024 closed season was strictly observed in order to reap its benefits.

 Closed season, also known as biological rest or no-harvesting period, is the halting of fishing activities during the spawning period of fish stocks when the fish are most productive.

 It also gives the fish a chance to lay their eggs for the replacement of the lost population due to fishing and other natural causes.

 Closed seasons are observed globally as a way of reducing fishing pressure on stocks and are considered one of the key fisheries management measures to help protect fish stocks and increase their population.", Leo Nelson,Regional, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/No-mercy-for-any-fisherman-who-engages-in-illegal-fishing-Hawa-Koomson-1937797
Police arrest Okada riders a day after massively welcoming Prof. Naana Opoku Agyemang,"The Akyem Tafo District Police Command arrested dozens of Okada riders and confiscated their motorbikes a day after they massively welcomed Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, the running mate to John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), in Abuakwa North. About 35 Okada riders were arrested on Thursday, the first day of the operation, which targeted riders without licenses and unregistered motorbikes.

 David Kwame Akrofi, station chairman for the Okada Riders, told Kasapa News that the arrest was carried out by the police and officials from the Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) office in Koforidua.

 The operation is politically motivated because we supported the NDC Running Mate when she came here. They arrested many of our people (Okada Riders). If you are able to pay GHC 500, they leave you; if you fail, they confiscate your motorbike, David Akrofi said.

 Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang had visited Abuakwa North on June 26, 2020, receiving strong support from Okada riders, who led her convoy through various communities to show their backing for the NDCs promise to legalize their operations.

 John Dramani Mahama has also pledged to establish an electric motorbike assembly plant in Ghana if he wins the 2024 general elections, providing electric motorbikes on a hire-purchase basis for Okada riders.

 The Okada business has created nearly one million jobs for the unemployed youth across the country.

 The Abuakwa North Communications Officer of the NDC, Wahab Amadu, told Kasapa News the Akyem Tafo Police Commands operation is politically motivated, carried out on orders from above to frustrate Okada riders due to their support for the NDC running mate.

 He called on regional and national NDC executives to help secure bail for the arrested riders.

 The Okada President in Abuakwa North came to meet the parliamentary candidate that they had heard about the coming of Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, so they wanted to show their support because John Mahama has assured to legalize their operations. So they collected party shirts and flags and massively welcomed the running mate. They were about 75 in number... Then the next day, they say instructions from above. About 35 motors were confiscated, and riders were arrested and detained without writing their statements, said Wahab.

 Wahab Amadu added, The NPP is shaken by what they saw. That is why the Municipal Chief Executive Alhaji Bodinga and the parliamentary candidate Buffalo are pushing this evil agenda, he said.",,Regional, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Police-arrest-Okada-riders-a-day-after-massively-welcoming-Prof-Naana-Opoku-Agyemang-1937766
NHIA commends F. Alpha and Omega Specialist Hospital for exemplary services,"The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has commended the F. Alpha and Omega Specialist Hospital in Madina, management's voluntary registration of more people onto the National Health Scheme (NHIS) for free.

This came to light when the NHIA Deputy Chief Executive for Operations, Louisa Atta-Agyemang paid a working visit to the hospital on Tuesday June, 25, 2024.

According to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Francis Fosu, the facility became operational  three months and realized that  majority of residents there were not insured by the NHIS.

This, he said informed management's desire to embark on 'Operation 20,000 registration of more people onto the NHIS for free.

Mr. Francis Fosu further explained that the rapid intervention was in line with the hospital's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), geared towards encouraging people to subscribe to the NHIS.


""When we started operations three months ago, many people in the community lacked NHIS cards and some had not renewed their membership due to a low level of trust in the Scheme. To address this, the hospital set an ambitious goal to register 20,000 new members for free, with 7,000 members already registered.""
He reassured NHIS members of total healthcare services without any challenges, especially illegal charges for services covered by the Scheme, reaffirming the hospitals commitment to patient care and support.

Mr. Fosu raised concern about the disparity between market prices of medicines and the prices set by the NHIA, which he bemoaned is affecting the hospital's operations. 

During the visit, the NHIA Deputy Chief Executive for Operations, Louisa Atta-Agyemang interacted with some NHIS members on admission in various wards and they confided in her that the NHIS covered all their medical bills and expressed their profound gratitude for not paying extra monies.

She commended the hospital's management for their exemplary services, highlighting credentialed healthcare providers role in enhancing the importance of the NHIS.

She was impressed with the hospital management's free registration of more people onto the NHIS and renewing the expired membership of some beneficiaries of the Scheme.

She underscored the need for other credentialled healthcare providers to adopt similar practices to enhance quality and affordable healthcare accessibility, and as well renew public trust in the NHIS.

She advised credentialed healthcare providers to stop extorting monies (illegal charges) from NHIS members for services covered by the Scheme.

The renovated school was officially commissioned in a ceremony that marked the realization of a vision set forth by His Royal Majesty King Tackie Teiko Tsuru II, the Ga Mantse and President of the Ga Traditional Council.

In his address at the commissioning ceremony, Elder S. Gifford Nielsen, Africa West Area President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, expressed his joy in seeing the project come to fruition. 

""We are honored to support this vital initiative that will impact the lives of many children in this community. Education is the cornerstone of a bright future, and we are committed to helping provide the resources needed for these children to succeed,"" Elder Nielsen stated.

He added that successful completion of the Mantse Tackie Tawiah I Cluster of Schools renovation is ample proof of the power of collaboration and the impact of community-driven initiatives. 

Elder Nielsen was confident that as the students and teachers of the school step into their new and improved environment, the foundation has been laid for a brighter educational future in Adabraka.

Greater Accra Regional Minister, Nii Kwartei Titus Glover representing President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, said it was a day of great delight seeing the advancement of education through enhanced infrastructure. This is consistent with our agenda to make education accessible to all Ghanaians, he noted. 

The project, which began on August 2, 2021, during the King's 50th birthday, stemmed from his commitment to enhancing the educational infrastructure for the children in his community. Instead of a lavish birthday celebration, the King chose to spend the day with the students of the Mantse Tackie Tawiah I Cluster of Schools. Shocked by the dilapidated state of the school, he pledged to renovate it to provide a conducive learning environment.

The journey to the renovation began with the formation of a committee led by Honorable Ekow Spio Garbrah  an alumnus of the school  who worked tirelessly alongside the Municipal Chief Executive of Korley Klottey, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Ga Mantse Foundation, and various other stakeholders. 

Their combined efforts led to the sod-cutting ceremony on May 10, 2023, and the commencement of construction shortly thereafter.



On her part, Member of Parliament for the Korle Klottey Constituency, Dr. Zanetor Rawlings, lauded the collaborative efforts that made the renovation possible. ""This is the most dramatic transformation of any school I have personally witnessed. This project is a shining example of what can be achieved when communities and organisations come together with a shared vision. The refurbishment of this school will undoubtedly have a lasting positive impact on our children's education and future prospects,"" Dr. Rawlings remarked.

The newly refurbished school now boasts state-of-the-art facilities that will provide students with a better learning environment. Classrooms have been upgraded, new educational materials provided, and essential amenities installed to support the holistic development of the students.

The Mantse Tackie Tawiah I Cluster of Schools now features a newly built library with over 2,000 books and a state-of-the-art ICT center with 40 fully installed computers. The project included the renovation of the 12-unit Mantse Tackie Tawiah block, the 6-unit Liberty Avenue block, the Mantse Tackie Tawiah KG block, and the Liberty Avenue ICT Laboratory and office. 

Additionally, a new astro turf football pitch with a 60-seater spectator stand, an 8-seater toilet facility with urinals and girls' changing rooms, and a 100-seater canteen have been constructed. A 20-seater toilet facility was also renovated. The school's perimeter was upgraded with a new fence wall, improved drainage, new pavements, landscaping, a new security post, and an upgraded entrance.

King Tackie Teiko Tsuru II, whose vision and dedication drove the project, shared his aspirations for the future. ""This renovation is just the beginning. I have many more dreams for the Ga State, and with the continued support of our development partners, we will achieve them. Every child deserves the opportunity to receive quality education and realize their full potential,"" the King affirmed.",,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/The-Church-of-Jesus-Christ-of-Latter-day-Saints-supports-renovation-of-Mantse-Tackie-Tawiah-I-Cluster-of-Schools-1937680

It is noted that ""While RBL has significantly reduced financial strain and funded the development of Ghanas oil and gas industry, it is also susceptible to misuse and serves as a conduit for illicit financial flows (IFFs). Ghana, like other Sub-Saharan African countries with oil reserves, faces increasing vulnerability to corruption when managing oil wealth.""

The Programme Director in charge of Media for Peace and Sustainable Development at MFWA, Dr. Kojo Impraim, asserted that Ghanaians are not eager to hold individuals and politicians accountable for the quality of life based on limited or no knowledge of the benefits of the countrys extractive sector.

As part of the effort to increase access to information for the public on the oil and gas sector, he entreated media practitioners to set an agenda of consistent publication on the sector and effectively sustain it.

Dr. Impraim expressed dismay over the two major political parties, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), having absolute control over the airwaves to influence their parties' agendas rather than the interests of the citizens.

He acknowledged that journalists face restrictions from these parties on their ability to independently report on critical matters affecting the country due to the ownership structure and the editorial policies of some media houses.

Dr. Impraim opined that the country is plagued with corruption and misuse of state resources, hence charging the training beneficiaries to dedicate space in the media to avert the corruption menace.

The training equipped the media practitioners with experiential knowledge, contextual ideas, participatory opportunities, and the development of case studies in the oil and gas sector.", Nicholas Tetteh,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Journalists-receive-training-on-Illicit-Financial-Flows-1937675
Accra Zongo Chief marks annual durbar of chiefs,"Thousands of people, including prominent chiefs, politicians, and queen mothers from the Zongo communities in the Greater Accra Region and across the country, gathered on Sunday at Sabon Zongo, a suburb of Accra, to mark the annual durbar of chiefs.

The durbar, which seeks to bring together Muslim tribal chiefs and traditional leaders from various communities, was under the leadership of Sarki Dr. Alhaji Yahaya Hamisu Bako.

The colorful and well-organized durbar, held under the theme ""Ensuring Peaceful Elections in December 2024: The Role of the Youth and Traditional Leaders,"" provided an opportunity for the Zongo Chiefs to engage the youth on the importance of promoting peace before, during, and after the December election.

The youth were called upon to make peace their top priority ahead of the December polls and to consider the lives of children and women before perpetuating any form of violence. They were urged to reject any offers from politicians to commit crimes and to be bold in saying no to political violence.

Parents, especially mothers, were encouraged to advise their children on the importance of promoting peace. Mothers, who have a significant influence on their children, were urged to add their voices to the call for peace.

It was noted that many politicians have enrolled their children in universities abroad to become better individuals, yet they often use ordinary Ghanaian youth for political gains during elections.

The four-hour durbar, characterized by cultural and traditional performances from the Hausa and other tribal communities, aimed to deepen the bond between the Hausa people and other tribes in Zongo.

The arrival of the Greater Accra Zongo Chief, Sarki Dr. Yahaya Hamisu Bako, along with his entourage of other chiefs and royal guards, signified the commencement of the event. The gathering vibrated with the display of traditional drumming, dance performances, and the Taure (Magical performance) group.

The streets outside the durbar grounds were filled with thousands of people cheering the sub-chiefs in a procession, characterized by horse riding, through the principal streets to the durbar grounds.

The Moshie Chief of Okaikoi Central, the Moshie Chief of Ablekuma Central, Naaba Tigri, and other chiefs and queen mothers joined the event in their beautiful chieftaincy regalia.

The Greater Accra Zongo Chief also installed the Second Lady of Ghana, Her Excellency Hajia Mrs. Samira Bawumia, who was born and raised in Sabon Zongo, with the title of 'Uwan Giwa' of the Zongo communities in Ghana. The Second Lady was represented by her aide, Hajia Baawe, another prominent figure in the Zongo community.

A fundraising ceremony for the construction of Madrasas (Islamic School Project) attracted many prominent members of society, including the Chairman of the occasion, the Kasoa Odikro, Sani Mohammed Yusif, the Member of Parliament for Ablekuma Central, Abdul Latif Dan, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) parliamentary candidate, Mr. Jefferson Kwamena Sackey, former NPP parliamentary aspirant Mr. Collins Amoah, the Development Queen Mother of Osu Ashante, Manye Naa Odofeley Wornor I, Hajia Hajara Kariki, Giwan Maata Hausawa Ankara, Hajia Fati Rashid, Sarauniya Zango Ankara, the office of the second lady, Magajias of various Zongo communities, and other chiefs to donate towards the construction of the Islamic Schools.

Other activities, such as a clean-up exercise, a football gala competition, registration for National Health Insurance Cards, and health and eye screenings, were held a few days before the main durbar.

Addressing the durbar, the Greater Accra Zongo Chief, Sarki Dr. Yahaya Hamisu Bako, expressed gratitude to the Second Lady, Her Excellency Mrs. Hajia Samira Bawumia, and all the chiefs present for their support of the Zongo community's development. 

He called on the Second Lady to frequently visit the palace and explore ways to further support and reshape the palace and the community.", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Accra-Zongo-Chief-marks-annual-durbar-of-chiefs-1937670

"Total Woman Network sensitises girls on menstrual hygiene, management, teenage pregnancy, HIV","A dedicated non-governmental organization, Total Woman Network, is addressing menstrual hygiene and management, teenage pregnancy, and HIV awareness for adolescent girls. By providing sanitary pads and comprehensive HIV education, Total Woman Network is improving the health, dignity, and future prospects of young Ghanaian girls.

In many areas, menstruation is stigmatized and misunderstood, with a lack of access to hygienic menstrual products posing significant barriers to education and social participation. To combat this, the NGO dispatched free sanitary pads and toiletries to schools and underprivileged communities, promoting long-term menstrual hygiene and management. Total Woman Network also introduced 'Pad Banks' for sustainable period solutions in schools and communities.

In addition to menstrual hygiene, the NGO addressed teenage pregnancy and HIV awareness and prevention. Adolescents, especially girls, are vulnerable to HIV due to various factors. Total Woman Network's HIV education program equipped young people with accurate information about transmission, prevention, and treatment, collaborating with healthcare professionals to provide workshops on safe sex practices, testing, and antiretroviral therapy.

The Girl Pad Project, running for several years, seeks sponsors, partnerships, and collaborations. Integrating menstrual hygiene and management, teenage pregnancy prevention, and HIV sensitization into a cohesive framework, the Founder of Total Woman Network, Lady Edna Quartey, said, can enhance the effectiveness of interventions. Educating teenagers about abstinence and safe sex practices, she said, includes the use of condoms, regular testing, and the importance of antiretroviral therapy for those living with HIV, which can significantly reduce transmission rates.

Speaking on teenage health, Lady Edna and her team stated that adolescence is a critical period for physical development. She said proper personal hygiene and regular physical activity are essential for healthy growth and development.

The educational workshops were held at several schools: Ndoda D/A JHS/Primary School in Nsawam, Danso D/A Anglican JHS and Primary School, and Tortibo Presby JHS/Primary School, all located in Nsawam in the Eastern Region, as well as the Teshie Camp 2 Cluster of Schools and the Teshie LEKMA Southern Cluster of Schools in the Greater Accra Region.", Emmanuel Tornyi,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Total-Woman-Network-sensitises-girls-on-menstrual-hygiene-management-teenage-pregnancy-HIV-1937659
ASU celebrates milestone with new national secretariat,"The Asante Students' Union (ASU) marked a historic moment on June 17, 2024, with the official commissioning of their brand-new, ultramodern office in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region.

Solely funded and built by Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei and his family, this momentous occasion served as a celebration of ASU's legacy and an opportunity to chart a path for a progressive future for members.

The ceremony, held at the new office in Asokwa, a suburb of Kumasi, brought together distinguished guests, including Dr. Richard Anane, Nana Baffour Opoku Agyemang, Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei, and other notable personalities.

The Asante Students' Union (ASU) was formed in 1979 at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) by a group of resilient and determined Asante students at a rather difficult time when the 'culture of silence' dominated in Ghana and the voices of intellectuals and opinion leaders were suppressed into complete oblivion.

The spirited students who defied the odds at the time to form ASU include the former Ghanaian diplomat and physician, Dr. Kwame Bawuah-Edusei; the late former Vice President of Hewlett Packard California, Osei Prempeh; the former Health Minister, Dr. Richard Anane; and former NPP Ashanti Regional Chairman Frederick Fredua Antoh (FF Antoh).

The formation of the Asante Students' Union (ASU) became the keystone organization for Asante students and Asantemen during that difficult period of Ghana's political history.

ASU executives and members have resolved to go beyond academics by actively promoting the cultural and social well-being of their members through a series of workshops to strategically propel members into greatness.

Speaking at the ceremony, Dr. Bawuah-Edusei passionately expressed his pride in the achievements of the group.

He emphasized the inclusive nature of the organization, revealing that ""ASU is an all-encompassing society that discusses all aspects of Asante development. An organization for indigenes of Asanteman.""

He further charged the visibly excited gathering to consciously assume the role of advocates for its members, society, and Asanteman.

""This building is more than just bricks and mortar. It represents our unwavering commitment to the growth, unity, and empowerment of Asante students,"" Dr. Bawuah-Edusei said.

Re-echoing Dr. Bawuah-Edusei's sentiments, Otumfuo Twafuohene, the patron of the association, expressed gratitude to the founding members for their dedication to ASU and Asanteman.

He further extended his appreciation to Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene, for his leadership and support.

The National President of ASU, Nana Konadu Yiadom, shared his enthusiasm for the new office.

""We have the power to make a positive impact on Asanteman in all aspects. This new office will be our central hub, fostering collaboration, learning, and the development of initiatives that benefit both our members and the wider community,"" he declared.

Frederick Fredua Antoh and Dr. Richard Anane have, over the years, made significant contributions to ensure the group remains vibrant at all times.

With the inauguration of the new national secretariat, the Asante Students' Union (ASU) embarks on a new chapter, empowered to continue its legacy of service and build an even more formidable future for its members and the entire Asanteman.", Stephen Darko,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/ASU-celebrates-milestone-with-new-national-secretariat-1937656

Kejetia Market fire: Tension brews over missing 200k donation from Dr. Bawumia to victims,"Tension is rising at Kejetia Market in the Ashanti Region over a missing donation of 200,000 Ghana cedis from Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia to fire victims.

According to traders, the Vice President donated GHC 200,000 during his recent tour of the region, but they have yet to receive the money. 

Instead, some queen mothers allegedly seized the money, claiming it was given to them as a token to share.

However, the traders suspect that the queen mothers have kept the money for themselves.

The General Secretary for the Combined Kejetia Traders Association, Reuben Amey, addressed the media on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, revealing that the Chief of Staff, Akosua Frema Osei Opare, intervened and donated GHC 300,000 to the traders after they planned a massive demonstration.

However, the traders claim that the market management has refused to hand over the additional GHC 300,000 to the fire victims, attempting to swindle the money once again.

The leader of the Kejetia fire victims, Nathaniel Boampondem, expressed disappointment and called on authorities, particularly the NPP leadership, to act swiftly to avoid chaos at the market.

The traders are demanding that the authorities ensure the fire victims receive the money, and they have threatened to take action if the issue is not resolved promptly.

Background:

On March 15, 2023, there was a fire outbreak at a section of the Kejetia Market that left many victims distressed.

The fire also destroyed properties worth millions of cedis. 

The fire incident is one of over nine hundred cases recorded in the region from the beginning of the year to December 10, 2023.

The figure represents a 13.42% reduction in the number of cases (1,058) recorded during the same period in 2022.

Nine fatalities were recorded from these cases, a reduction from the 15 lives lost in 2022.

The estimated cost of damaged property also shot up astronomically in the year, although a significant cost of salvaging property was made.

Approximately GHC 226,701,206.00 were lost as a result of these fire cases. Although there were losses, we managed to salvage over GHC 370 million worth of properties as compared to the more than GHC 340 million recorded last year, he said.",,Regional, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Kejetia-Market-fire-Tension-brews-over-missing-200k-donation-from-Dr-Bawumia-to-victims-1937621

A continuous ""Dont Drink and Drive Campaign"" will include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers. This includes in-app notifications, regular training, out-of-home marketing campaigns, and numerous advertisements.

The safety forum, which is the first step in the campaign, took place on Wednesday, June 26, 2024, at the Alisa Hotel in Accra and covered topics such as recognizing signs of impairment, strategies for preventing drunk driving, and how to use alternative transportation options like ride-hailing services such as Yango.

The training, provided by certified instructors, was available to all Yango partner drivers and passengers free of charge. It was attended by over 150 participants, including Yangos partners, partner drivers, passengers, and authorities from various safety organizations across the country.

As part of the ""Dont Drink and Drive Campaign,"" Yango and Guinness organized a safety training session to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence and to highlight the many safety features Yango has provided for both partner drivers and passengers.

The campaign will also include promotional events and activities to encourage responsible drinking habits by passengers and discourage drunk driving by partner drivers. This includes in-app notifications, regular training, out-of-home marketing campaigns, and numerous advertisements. Yango and Guinness are working together to create a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community.

We are committed to promoting responsible road practices and ensuring the safety of passengers and partner drivers. By partnering with Guinness Ghana PLC, we hope to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving and provide the community with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe and responsible choices. We are excited to contribute our quota in ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone in the country. Safety is a fundamental need and plays a key role in our vision to create income-generating opportunities for partner drivers while providing affordable and convenient transportation for passengers, said Mr. Ofonime Tom, Country Manager of Yango Ghana.

The Safety Forum also featured a panel discussion with experts from the health and safety industry speaking on road ethics, crime, safety techniques, and measures to ensure the safety and security of both partner drivers and passengers.

Lynessa Darko, Sustainability and Responsibility Manager at Guinness Ghana PLC, expressed optimism about the campaign and safety training while encouraging more ride-hailing companies to follow Yango's footsteps in ensuring the safety and well-being of their key stakeholders.

She said, Safeguarding our community is very important in national development. Ensuring that, as brands and companies, we play our roles in providing adequate safety education and awareness to help drivers and passengers stay alert on the roads while knowing the dangers of drunk driving is the first step to achieving a safe and sound environment viable for economic growth.

The beneficiary partner drivers received certificates of participation to confirm that they have successfully completed the safety training and are fully aware of the many safety features provided by Yango for partner drivers, such as the display of passenger ratings, identity photo checks in special cases, display of alert zones and non-penalty configuration for drivers to skip orders to alert zones, display of passenger profile pictures, rating forms to evaluate riders, and in-app calls to support.

The passengers who attended the training also expressed their gratitude to Yango and Guinness for organizing this initiative and pledged to use the knowledge acquired to ensure their safety and the safety of other road users.

Some of the safety features available to passengers include rating forms to evaluate trips, display of driver ratings, safety center (which houses the share route, ambulance and police, trusted contacts, and emergency situation buttons), SOS button, prompt support team, and drivers' document checks, among others.

This move aligns with Yangos launch of the ""Safety Talk Series"" last month, during which the company visited and educated students, faculty members, and the general public at the University of Ghana during their SRC week celebrations.

Artisans at Kpone Barrier face eviction after sale of land,"Over 2000 artisans have protested against the Tema Development Corporations (TDC) decision to forcefully evacuate them from a land they occupy at Kpone Barrier in the Kpone Katamanso Constituency in the Greater Accra Region.

The 36 hectares of land lying along the Tema-Aflao Road between Dawhenya and the B5 Construction Limited near Kpone Barrier have become the permanent residence and business sector for the artisans.

The residents on Tuesday, June 25, 2024, registered their displeasure in the area after some military men invaded the location, instructing them to vacate the portion of land without prior notice.

The aggrieved protestors, narrating their ordeal to the media, said the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC) owns the land and aims to reserve it to establish schools in the area.

According to the occupants, they acquired the land in consultation with the chiefs of Kpone, who freely gave out the land with the consent of the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation.

TDC has served us notice to vacate the place in a few months, indicating that TDC has moved on to sell the land to private investors without consulting the chiefs and GBC.

""TDC, on some occasions, deploys military personnel to force us from the land. We headed to court to remind TDC that we acquired the land from the chief in Kpone and would comply with the directives of the chiefs only, they mentioned.

The artisans' group, including food vendors, electrical engineers, tanker modelers, craftsmen, and drivers, bemoaned TDCs action, saying their livelihood will be in crisis since the current location remains their sole business hub.

The artisans added that the current government supports the activities and actions of TDC to sell lands in the Tema enclave to private businessmen without considering the plight of the citizens.

Expressing their concern over authorities selling the land, the artisans stated they have occupied the land for the last 20 years and are ready to negotiate with the authorities for any amount to transfer ownership to keep them on the land for their business purposes.

"Okyeman Environment Foundation, GES establish leopard clubs in Kyebi","The Okyeman Environment Foundation, in partnership with the Ghana Education Service (GES), has established leopard clubs in Kibi in the Abuakwa South Municipality of the Eastern Region.

The event aimed to educate young people in the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Area about the importance of environmental conservation.

The launch attracted a number of schools, including the Pano Presby School, Kibi Anglican School, Kibi State Primary School, Rock of Ages School, Kibi Demonstrations, and Kibi School for the Deaf, among others.

Held under the theme ""Empowering Young Minds on Environmental Conservation for a Sustainable Future,"" the chairman of the Okyeman Environment Foundation and the Asomkahene of Okyehene, Barima Nana Freduah Agyeman Okotomine, explained that Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin, the Akyem Abuakwa paramount chief, has a keen interest in ensuring that young pupils who are educated will grow to protect the environment and the vegetation cover for sustainable livelihoods and development.

According to Barima Nana Freduah Agyeman Okotomine, who is also the chairman of the steering committee, the proper education of children is the right step towards appreciating the need for environmental protection.

He said, ""If we educate children now, they will grow up with knowledge and thoughts about the importance of protecting diminishing forest cover and vegetation because they have already been taught the hazards that exist when the ecosystem is degraded.""

The Asomkahene of Okyehene also expressed regret that they had yet to reach the goal set by the Okyenhene more than two decades ago to protect the environment.

""We haven't reached the goal of 21 years since Okyenhene Nana Amoatia Ofori Panin gave us the task of protecting the environment, which is why we're here to empower these children to become environmental protection agents,"" he said.

Barima Nana Freduah Agyeman Okotomine declared that in order to encourage the next generation to assume responsibility for preventing environmental degradation, Leopard clubs would be expanded to all schools in Akyem Abuakwa and throughout Ghana. 

To guarantee that the goal is reached, a lot of work needs to be done by teachers, coordinators, environmental specialists, and partners.

The Guest of Honour at the event, Godfred Ofoe Caesar, Eastern Regional School Health Education Programme (SHEP) coordinator, stated that over the past decade, communities in the Akyem Abuakwa Kingdom (Okyeman) have faced severe levels of degradation evident with the influx of illegal mining activities, reckless tree felling, and poor agricultural practices, which are rapidly leading to a decline in the sustainable and economic fortunes gained from the resources of their livelihoods.

He asserted that encouraging reforestation and environmental sustainability was a more environmentally friendly way to raise primary school students' knowledge of environmental issues.

""It has been shown that students in schools will play a more active role in environmental preservation and continue to be change agents for a longer amount of time than adults,"" noted Mr. Caesar.

The SHEP Coordinator stated that the clubs will be a vehicle that allows students to actively participate in choosing and implementing health-related issues while they are in school.

He added that it allows students to become ""Agents of Change"" who take healthy habits and information from school home and put them into action, influencing their siblings, parents, and friends who are not in school.

According to him, all stakeholders, particularly those in health and education, ought to continue to support the children in school (club members), as it is a long-term plan to disseminate knowledge, education, and communication to community members about a specific activity or exercise.

On her part, Akosua Kwakye, the World Health Organization Ghana's nutrition officer, said that schools and young people were essential change agents and could be effective advocates for environmental and human health protection.

""On the global stage, we are already seeing students and young people mobilize to demand long-term action from their governments at all levels to address the critical climate catastrophe,"" she said.

She furthered that this example inspires optimism and provides an opportunity to use the power of schools to combat forest destruction, galamsey, and environmental degradation.

""School provides a unique context for preventative interventions, and the several years spent in school are a crucial opportunity to create healthy and sustainable behaviors that can contribute to a lifetime of activism to protect the environment and improve health,"" she added.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 26 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Okyeman-Environment-Foundation-GES-establish-leopard-clubs-in-Kyebi-1937441
"Kasoa-Winneba highway construction: Traditional leaders in Awutu, Budumburam demand payment of compensation","The Awutu and Budumburam Traditional Councils in the Central Region are demanding immediate payment of compensation to residents affected by the Kasoa-Winneba highway dualization project.

'Dr. Bawumia is the answer' - Effia MP details reasons Ghanaians must vote for him,"The Member of Parliament for Effia Constituency, Joseph Cudjoe, has outlined key reasons he believes Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia should garner support in Ghana's upcoming 2024 presidential election for the country's development to soar.

He argued that Dr. Bawumia is championing a vigorous campaign for Ghana to fully embrace digitalization across all sectors adding that this initiative is pivotal as it aims to drastically reduce opportunities for corruption.

""Those opposed to political corruption will support Bawumia, while those who benefit from corruption will oppose him,"" the lawmaker emphasized in a write up.

The digitalization drive, Cudjoe argues, will minimize face-to-face interactions, thereby eliminating avenues for unethical exchanges and favoritism based on social status or connections. 

""Under this system, every citizen will be treated fairly and based on merit,"" he mentioned. 

Additionally, Joseph Cudjoe assured that under a Bawumia administration, the Free Senior High School program will continue. 

This program not only aims to educate more Ghanaians but also to equip them with skills essential for the digital era.

""Education is crucial because it enables people to be adaptable and learn new technologies, which is key to national progress,"" the MP explained. 
Joseph Cudjoe stressed the importance of investing in human capital, citing it as a fundamental strategy for development. 

He noted, ""Developed nations focus on developing their human resources alongside natural resources, and Ghana should do the same.""

This vision, according to Cudjoe, forms the backbone of why he supports Dr. Bawumia's candidacy for president in the upcoming December elections and believes it holds the promise of a brighter future for Ghana.

Below is the full write-up:

Biggest NPP/Nana Addo/Bawumia Legacies for Ghana 

The biggest foundations the we are laying for Ghana for its future economic development and advancement are the following:

1. Educated Population (Free Senior High School): When everybody can read and write, you have a population that is trainable in modern skills and technology. This is the first secret of developed countries. They won't tell you. They will tell you to focus on natural resources whilst they focus on Human Resources.

2. Unique Identification of People (Ghana Card - popularly called the Bawumia Card): Every developed country knows its citizens and foreigners uniquely. I wonder why this eluded us for years. I save this for another day to highlight its importance. A Digitalization Agenda.

3. Unique Property Identification by geo-location and address: Come to the blue kiosk and the koko seller at the junction for directing people is gone. Once you fully achieve an educated population, this way of giving direction is gone forever. A Digitalization Agenda.

4. Phone contact numbers pinned to persons directly with their fingerprints on record: People may have noticed how parked robberies may have gone down. Just like the developed countries, your phone calls and fingerprints linked to your phone number will betray you. A Digitalization Agenda.

5. Tax Identification Numbers for Businesses and Individuals linked to Ghana Card: People will underrate this big achievement until the FLAT TAX SYSTEM Bawumia has proposed is fully implemented. A Digitalization Agenda.

6. Bank Accounts and Financial Transactions linked to Ghana Card: People don't know what is coming when it comes to SOLVING FINANCIAL CORRUPTION by being able to TRACK all financial transaction flows just because we have linked the transactions to our Ghana Cards. A Digitalization Agenda. For me, this is the biggest of the BOLD SOLUTIONS, after Free SHS.

7. Government Performance Tracker: In the past, ""ghost projects"" have been used to chop our taxes. This problem is eliminated. A Digitalization Agenda.

8. To Be Continued...

People don't have an idea what Bawumia is seeking to achieve for Ghana with his Digitalization Agenda. We just say Digitalization Digitalization without understanding it deeply. With his Digitalization Agenda fully rolled out, we will all soon realize that PEOPLE WHO HATE POLITICAL CORRUPTION WILL LOVE BAWUMIA, AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE POLITICAL CORRUPTION WILL HATE BAWUMIA.

Telecel Ghanas Cell Time connects families beyond prison walls,"In the James Camp Prison in Accra, Abdul Salam clutches the phone with shaky hands as his baritone voice is filled with emotion during a rare phone call to wish his dad Mohammed, a happy Fathers Day.

I want to wish you a happy Fathers Day. May Allah be with you and continue to make you great, Salam said in Hausa. The silence on the other end stretched for a while before an emotional and thankful response from his father filled the prisons meeting room. Hopefully by next year, I will be home, Salam adds.

For many inmates within the confined walls of prisons, Father's Day is often a stark reminder of the separation from their families. The crucial connection between prisoners and their families is usually strained for months and years during custody, denying them the basic show of love and support from their relatives.

In an unprecedented and heart-warming gesture to change this narrative, Telecel Ghana with support from the Ghana Prisons Service organised Cell Time  a prime opportunity for consenting inmates to call their fathers or father figures in their lives to rekindle the family bonds they share. 

Tears welled in the eyes of some inmates as they shared stories, apologies, and hope for a better future. Facilitated by seasoned Crime Check TV host, Ibrahim Kwarteng, the emotion-filled sessions connected prisoners to their fathers or older male relatives in their families and built bridges across miles with a simple phone call to mark Fathers Day on Sunday.

At Telecel, we appreciate the importance of human connection and acknowledge the challenges of maintaining family relationships from behind bars. Our goal with this initiative is to bring families together despite the physical boundaries and minimise the sense of loss and disconnection prisoners often feel, David Umoh, Telecels Director of Consumer Business Unit, said.

As the day came to a close, inmates were in high spirits, cherishing the memories of their conversations and grateful for the opportunity to reconnect and strengthen their family bonds. Telecels efforts were met with widespread appreciation from inmates, their families, and prison officials.

""This small act of kindness has brought so much hope and happiness to the inmates,"" said a prison warden. ""We are grateful to Telecel Ghana for their compassion and dedication to keeping families connected, even from behind bars.""

For inmate Ernest, the conversation with the father figure in his life has given him a newfound sense of hope but also a moment of remorse and reflection as he shared advice with the youth, who constitute about 85 per cent of the national prison population.

Shortcuts to riches always end in misery or tragedy. Young people shouldnt allow greed for money to lead them into activities that will end them up in prison. Take your time and get things right, Ernest said.",,Regional, 26 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Telecel-Ghana-s-Cell-Time-connects-families-beyond-prison-walls-1937379
Nzema Coalition raise concerns over $12 billion petroleum hub project in Jomoro,"The Coalition of Concerned Nzema People in the Western Region has voiced significant concerns regarding the recent Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed for the $12 billion Petroleum Hub project in Jomoro.

The project, set to cover 20,000 acres of land, has been met with trepidation by the local community.

Since 2021, community leaders, including Awulaem, Tumivol, Chiefs, the Member of Parliament, the Municipal Chief Executive, and the leadership of the Petroleum Hub Development Corporation (PHDC), have been informed of the coalition's apprehensions about the extensive land acquisition required for the project.

The coalition has clarified that their stance is not anti-development.

They acknowledge the economic and social value of the land, which has historically provided substantial benefits through coconut plantations, cash crops, and other resources.

The land also holds significant mineral deposits, including gold, clinker, and crude oil.

However, they argue that the land and its owners often become an afterthought in large-scale development projects, emphasizing that the land should be the most critical and costly consideration.

The coalition has outlined specific conditions that must be met before any land is allocated for the Petroleum Hub or similar projects:

Generational Compensation: The land will neither be sold nor compulsorily acquired by the government. It can only be leased with provisions for generational compensation.

Equity Interest: The community demands at least 25% of the investment value as equity, ensuring that the landowners benefit directly from the project.

Phased Land Acquisition: To prevent land grabs without actual development, the coalition proposes starting with 5,000 acres in the first phase. Further land allocation would depend on the successful completion of this initial phase.

Amenities: Given the risks associated with such a large project, the coalition demands the creation of essential amenities, including roads, hospitals, and training facilities, to help the local population take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Hub.

Job Quota: The coalition calls for a 30% job quota for the core affected communities to prevent local residents from being disadvantaged due to rising living costs associated with the project.

Senior Leadership Quota: They demand a quota in senior leadership positions to ensure continuous local representation in decision-making processes.

Environmental Safeguards: Highlighting the environmental beauty of the region, the coalition insists on concrete measures to protect rivers, streams, the sea, plantations, and forests from potential oil spills and other environmental hazards.

The coalition praised the efforts of their leaders but firmly stated that no land would be allocated for the Petroleum Hub until these demands are integrated into any agreements.

The statement was signed by representatives of the Coalition dated Tuesday, June 25, 2024, who are determined to protect their land and ensure that any development project benefits their community equitably and sustainably.",,Regional, 26 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Nzema-Coalition-raise-concerns-over-12-billion-petroleum-hub-project-in-Jomoro-1937363
Let us help the police to weed out criminals - ORCC Chief director,"Reverend Harry Nii Kwatei-Owoo, Chief Director of the Oti Regional Coordinating Council (ORCC), has called upon stakeholders in the region to assist the Ghana Police Service and other security agencies in apprehending unruly citizens who are compromising the reputation of the newly established Region. 

He emphasized that society should support the Service in eliminating these troublemakers and urged opinion and religious leaders, academicians, and influential figures to use their positions to advocate against gender-based violence (GBV) within their respective traditional areas.

Reverend Kwatei-Owoo made this appeal during a capacity-building program organized by the ORCC in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) for security officers in the Oti Region. 

He stated that SGBV is one of the most widespread human rights violations in Ghana, necessitating a multi-dimensional approach from all stakeholders, including bolstering the capabilities of DOVVSU to fulfill its mandate effectively.

Speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), he described the workshop as a 'train-the-trainers' program aimed at coordinators from various Divisional and District commands in the Oti Region, who are expected to positively influence others with the newly acquired knowledge and skills.

AbibiNsroma Foundation engages Keta-Vodza communities in progressive energy transition dialogue,"The AbibiNsroma Foundation, in collaboration with the FIDEP Foundation, has successfully conducted a community mobilization activity in Keta-Vodza,
bringing together a diverse group of 22 representatives from various coastal community groups.

This initiative aimed to foster a progressive, rights-based approach to energy transition and address the potential impacts of the Keta Delta Oil Block.

The event saw the participation of traditional authorities, fishermen associations, womens groups, and youth organizations, all united in their commitment to advocate for systemic change.

The attendees were drawn from the communities of Vodza, Kedzi Horvedzi, Kedzi Xorvi, Kedzi Harvedzi, Woe, Afidenyibga, and Anlo-Afidenyibga, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the region's populace.

Central to the discussions was the need for a sustainable and inclusive energy transition that considers the rights and livelihoods of local communities.

Participants engaged in in-depth deliberations on the potential environmental and socio-economic impacts of the Keta Delta Oil Block, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in decision-making processes.

Moreover, discussions highlighted international frameworks such as the UN Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Convention, which underscores the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities to give or withhold consent to projects affecting their lands and resources.

Participants explored how FPIC principles could strengthen local governance and ensure that community voices are central to energy development initiatives.

Additionally, the MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) and the OSPAR Convention were examined in relation to marine pollution prevention and management. 

Coastal community representatives expressed concerns over potential marine
environmental impacts from oil exploration and underscored the need for stringent environmental regulations and monitoring frameworks aligned with international standards.

In addition to debating the challenges and opportunities presented by the energy transition, the forum aimed to establish an active coalition. This coalition will work to demand systemic changes that prioritize environmental sustainability and social justice.

Following extensive deliberations, the participants drafted a joint communique outlining five key demands:

Full Implementation of FPIC: Demand that all energy projects, including the Keta Delta Oil Block, adhere to the principles of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent as outlined in the UN FPIC Convention. Local communities must have the right to meaningful consultation and decision-making regarding projects affecting their lands and resources.

Comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Call for a rigorous and transparent EIA process for the Keta Delta Oil Block and other energy projects. The assessment should include cumulative impacts on biodiversity, marine ecosystems, and local livelihoods.

Enhanced Environmental Regulations: Urge for strengthened regulations and
enforcement mechanisms, aligned with international standards such as MARPOL and
OSPAR, to prevent and mitigate environmental pollution from energy activities,
particularly in marine ecosystems.

Capacity Building and Empowerment: Request support for capacity-building programs that empower local communities, particularly women and youth, to actively participate in decision-making processes related to energy development and environmental management.

These demands reflect the collective aspirations of the coastal communities in Keta-Vodza to safeguard their environment, uphold their rights, and promote sustainable development in the face of energy transition challenges.

The AbibiNsroma Foundation and the FIDEP Foundation collaboration underscores a
commitment to empowering coastal communities in Keta-Vodza. By fostering collaboration and collective action, the foundations aim to ensure that energy policies and projects are aligned with the needs and rights of the people most affected.

As the coalition forms and plans its next steps, the foundations and community members remain committed to ongoing dialogue and advocacy, striving for a future where energy transition leads to sustainable development and improved livelihoods for all.", Kenneth Nana Amoateng,Regional, 25 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/AbibiNsroma-Foundation-engages-Keta-Vodza-communities-in-progressive-energy-transition-dialogue-1937301

There is power and authority in humility - Okyenhene tells leaders,"Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin has urged leaders to serve with humility and respect.

 According to the Okyenhene, throughout history, there has been no rich or great leader who died and was buried with his wealth.

 ""There is no rich man in the world who has been buried with his fleet of cars or houses. The memories they leave in the lives of others and their communities rather stay for life,"" Osagyefuo noted.

Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin added that a great leader leaves an indelible legacy for generations unborn.

 ""There is power in humility; there is authority in humility; we don't use power to enrich ourselves; we use power to serve diligently. The greatest currency is humility and service,"" he said.

 Addressing a durbar of the chiefs and people of the Benkum division of Akyem Abuakwa State, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin called on all traditional leaders within Okyeman to live an exemplary life that will positively impact the lives of their subjects.

 The Okyenehene, in his address, acknowledged the benefits of the free SHS policy for every Ghanaian child.

 However, he underscored the importance of addressing some challenges hindering the success of the program.

 He advocated for enough classroom blocks and furniture, along with other facilities that would make learning more convenient for the schoolchildren.

Calls for good remuneration for teachers:

Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin called on the government to motivate teachers by paying them good salaries.

 He said teacher motivation and good remuneration for teachers are inextricably linked with quality education.

 ""The future of our children is dependent on quality education and skill development. Today, every Ghanaian child has access to free SHS education. We must note that it's not just about passing through the school. There must be quality education. If you provide all the amenities and you don't pay the teacher well, it affects the children's education,"" he said.

 The Benkum Divisional Durbar is the second out of the five divisional royal durbars scheduled to be held in honor of Okyenhene's 25th-anniversary celebration.

 The anniversary will be celebrated under the theme ""25 Years of Sustainable Leadership and Service to Humanity.""

History of the Benkum Division:

 Benkum is the second-largest division within the Akyem Abuakwa State structure. It has over 300 towns and villages.

 Within the Akyem Abuakwa state hierarchy, the Benkumhene, otherwise known as the Fanteakwahene, is the commander-in-chief of the left wing of the army, with his permanent residence at Begoro, the capital of the division.

 The Benkum Division occupies a very large area of land.

 It was the bastion of the western division of the Akyem Abuakwa Army.

 In ancient times, the western part of Akyem Abuakwa State was more exposed to hostile states than any other division.

 The Benkum Division shares borders with Asante, Kwahu, Akwamu, Krobo, and parts of the Volta Region.

 The Benkumhene's dresses and coronets are the same as the Nifahene's; both are equal in rank.

 During parades, the Benkumhene is third in line behind the Adontenhene. The Benkumhene belongs to the Royal Asona clan.

 The principal chiefs in this division are the Odauhene of Osenase and Otwereso. He is equal in rank to the Benkumhene.

 The Benkumhene and Begorohene, however, take precedence in all matters, civil and military, and he is the acknowledged head of the division.

 The rest are chiefs of Apinaman, Osino, otherwise known as Mumuadu Sei, Suhum, Amanase, Sawirako, and Apedwa, among others.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 25 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/There-is-power-and-authority-in-humility-Okyenhene-tells-leaders-1937243
Chaos erupts at Kejetia market over trading space dispute,"A clash between trading groups at Kejetia Market in Kumasi on Monday, June 24, 2024, resulted in chaos, wailing, and curses.

 The dispute centers around trading spaces, which shop owners claim are being sold by management, including Managing Director Kofi Duffour and Operations Director Nana Poku, allegedly with the backing of the Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah.

 The shop owners alleged that the spaces in question are designated for emergency access and firefighting purposes, not trading.

 They claim that management has sold all market spaces, blocking emergency exits and putting the market at risk in case of a fire outbreak.

 The traders are resisting the sale of the disputed space and have cautioned the Ashanti Regional Minister and the KMA boss to intervene.

 They have also raised concerns about the inaccessibility of fire hydrants in the market, which they say are often blocked by traders and developers or sealed due to leakages.

 The situation has sparked concerns about fire safety in the market.",,Regional, 25 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Chaos-erupts-at-Kejetia-market-over-trading-space-dispute-1937195

Still at the Obuasi Municipal Assembly, he met with the Municipal Chief Executive Officer and the assemblys staff, where he emphasized the importance of their continued hard work to ensure timely completion of the projects for the benefit of the local populace.

During these interactions, Korsah reiterated the governments commitment to enhancing infrastructure and improving living conditions in secondary cities across the nation. 

He urged the municipal staff to maintain high standards of work and dedication to expedite the projects, highlighting the significant impact these developments would have on the communities.

UMZ launches solar PV installation training programme,"UWZ Partner Africa Project, a German environmental center, in collaboration with the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Service, has launched a three-year solar training program at the Applied Technical Institute in Accra.

The solar training project is aimed at empowering Ghanaians, especially the youth, with a focus on vocational training students to venture into the greener energy sector. It also aims to empower Ghana's solar workforce and provide students with technology for sustainable green energy.

Highlighting more on the aim of the training, the international project manager for the Partner Africa Vocational Training Project for Solar in Ghana, Carola Schmidt, in an interview with GhanaWeb said, ""We started this programme in December 2022 to launch a solar short-term training for electricians and for all people who are into electricals and electronics to become a solar installer, system designer, and sales and marketing person in solar.""

She further said, ""We put in place this programme for sales and marketing and system design because we think that females might be more interested in this than taking the risk to do solar installations.""

""We thought that having a job in the solar sector by designing the systems that other technicians do the installation for might be more interesting for women. By developing these training modules, we thought especially of women to be part of this training program,"" she added.

Carola Schmidt encouraged more females to join the training program because there will be a mentorship programme in place to give them special support during the training and even help them find a job afterwards.

KATH Oncology department staff strike over broken equipment,"Management of the Oncology department at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ashanti region, has announced an indefinite strike, effective Monday, June 24, 2024.

 The strike has left numerous patients who traveled from far and near for treatment at the referral facility stranded.

 The staff of the oncology department cited the lack of management commitment to repairing or replacing broken equipment as the reason for the strike.

 However, according to Kwame Frimpong, the Public Relations Director of the facility, management has procured new equipment to retool the department, which is expected to arrive by the end of the week.

 He expressed surprise at the strike, as management had kept the oncology department informed of the measures being taken to create a conducive working environment for effective healthcare delivery.

 Management of the Board of the Hospital are currently in a board meeting and are expected to meet leadership of the striking doctors after the meeting.

 However, a member of the striking doctors who spoke with Ghone News on condition of Anonymity said we are tired of promises, our weak equipment have broken down for several years making our working very difficult. Present and past management have not helped matters in fixing the problem thats why we are on strike. We are taking care of patients on admission we are not admitting news cases.

 He explained let me put this one on record, the entire Komfo anokye Teaching Hospital is working. Every department is very active and busy providing medical treatments to patients. Its only the Oncology department that is not working. The general public must take note of that.

"Regulate church activities to stop exploitation, fake prophecies - Lecturer to Christian Council","A senior lecturer at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Dr. Stephen Appiah Takyi, has called on the Christian Council of Ghana to regulate church activities to reduce emotional and economic exploitation.

""I have always advocated for the establishment of systems to control church activities in order to reduce the rot in the system,"" he said.

""While I believe the government should not get involved too much in this matter, I think major religious bodies can lead the charge to ensure their colleagues who are glaringly misleading people in the name of religion are brought back on track,"" he added. 

The lecturer in the Planning Department made these comments on Kumasi-based OTEC 102.9 FM's morning show, Nyansapo, on Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

Nzema MCE cuts sod for construction of 6-unit classroom block for Sika Ne Asem Municipal Basic School,"The Nzema East Municipal Assembly in the Western Region has cut sod for the construction of a six-unit classroom block expected to be constructed and completed within four months.

 The Municipal Chief Executive, Eric Essien, confirmed the construction of the new block during the sod-cutting ceremony.

 The Assembly, he said, aims to ensure that the current education infrastructure challenges facing the municipality will be dealt with through the provision of the needed infrastructure in the area.

 He said Sika Ne Asem Basic School remains crucial to education development in the Nzema East Municipality in the Western Region, hence the efforts being made to improve infrastructure and other projects required to enhance teaching and learning.

 The intervention made by the municipality follows the lack of basic social infrastructure and amenities necessary for the development of young minds.

 ""The situation of teaching and learning has become very difficult in the cocoa production village,"" he said.

 In an interview, some of the teachers at the school confirmed they were worried about the present situation and indicated that something ought to be done by the government to improve infrastructure and, at the same time, enhance teaching and learning in the school.

 The teachers complained bitterly about the current state of the school, despite the frantic efforts being made by teachers to impact lives.

 They believe the current dilapidated structure poses a danger to the lives of both teachers and pupils.

 According to the teachers, the school usually closes anytime it rains due to the poor state of the classroom blocks.

 In addition, the inadequate number of teachers in the school, they noted, also affects teaching and learning, as the few teachers often combine classes to teach, therefore denying the pupils a quality teaching and learning environment.

 Responding to these challenges as part of measures to put an end to the suffering of both teachers and pupils, the municipality has vowed to meet the timeline for the execution of the project.

 In terms of the lack of teachers, the MCE observed that due to the lack of a telecommunication network in the densely populated cocoa farming area with over twelve thousand people, teachers posted to the community often leave unceremoniously due to the absence of these social amenities.

 The few teachers currently working in the community, therefore, constantly have to combine classes to teach the pupils.

 The MCE, Eric Essien, also hinted that the lack of teachers' quarters continues to discourage those being posted to the community to teach.", Daniel Kaku,Regional, 24 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Nzema-MCE-cuts-sod-for-construction-of-6-unit-classroom-block-for-Sika-Ne-Asem-Municipal-Basic-School-1937055
Land guards activities surge in Ashanti Region; REGSEC warns of prosecution,"The Ashanti Regional Security Council(REGSEC) has warned that it will arrest and prosecute persons found to have engaged the services of land guards in the region.

According to the REGSEC, the land guards will not be spared either, as they will be made to face the full rigours of the law.

The warning comes after the REGSEC said it has observed with serious concern the gradual surge of illegal operations of land guards in some communities in the region.

Land guards are organized criminal groups employed to protect land and property, over land disputes and controversies, using violence, which always results in the eruption of violent clashes.

A statement signed by the Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah explained that over the years, the Ashanti Region has been fortunate because all stool lands are vested in His Royal Majesty, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene, with his chiefs as caretakers. There is therefore every opportunity, in instances of land controversies and disputes, to appeal to His Majesty for the resolution of the disputes.""

The REGSEC asked citizens within the region to resort to the right channel to have issues about their lands addressed.

Based on this fact, the Ashanti Regional Security Council requests all citizens in the region to use the right procedures to address their land disputes rather than to employ the use of land guards whose activities always threaten law-abiding citizens and result in violence.

It is the expectation of the Regional Security Council, that the public will accept the above directives for strict compliance to ensure peace in the region.

According to the MP, the educational trip will allow candidates who excel in the examination to visit some important places, including Parliament and the Flagstaff House.

He believes the excursion will motivate the students to learn and pass their examinations. 

The Tamale North MP disclosed this on Sunday when he toured the various centers of his annual free extra classes organized for over 500 BECE candidates in the constituency.

Mr. Suhuyini said many students in the constituency have never had the opportunity to travel outside the Northern Regional Capital or interact with the country's legislators; hence, such an arrangement would encourage them to pass their exams. 

""For some of them, it may be the first time they are traveling outside their comfort zone. Again, it is going to help them develop a certain level of confidence. In my view, the fact that they get to go to Accra would inspire them to want to get better results.

Kasoa ritual murder: Court orders 18-year-old accused to be remanded into prison over misconduct,"The High Court in Accra has issued a trial warrant for an 18-year-old young offender involved in the ongoing Kasoa ritual murder case. This order mandates that the accused be kept in Nsawam prisons custody instead of a police cell due to allegations of misconduct at the police cells.

 The 18-year-old, the second accused, is standing trial alongside a 15-year-old juvenile (the first accused) for the murder of 10-year-old Ishmael Mensah Abdella in Kasoa.

 The order by Justice Lydia Osei Marfo means that the young offender, who has been in police custody since his arrest in April 2021, will now be under the care of the prison authority.

 In court on Monday, June 24, 2024, Nana Adoma Osei, a senior state attorney, informed the court that officers at the Osu Police Station requested that the second accused should not be returned to their custody after the court session that day.

 While the prosecution did not immediately specify the issues caused by the second accused in police cells, they requested that he be remanded in prison custody based on the information received.

 The Osu Police Station made a request that he should not be brought back from the court today, the state attorney informed the court. She added, Our prayer this morning is that he should be remanded into prison custody, and a trial warrant issued so that the prison officers would be responsible for bringing him to court as needed, the Prosecution narrated.

 Lawrence Boampong Wireko, counsel for the second accused, stated that he was not aware of such information and requested that the second accused remain in police cells since the trial is nearly concluded, with only the summing up and the jurys verdict pending. He also asked the court to caution the second accused and offered to speak to him about his conduct.

 The investigator who accompanied the accused to the court stated that the 18-year-old has been rotated among various police stations, including Ministry, Nima, Cantonment, and currently Osu Police Station. The officer noted that the second accused has been involved in fights with inmates at both Osu and Cantonment stations.

 However, the second accused denied these allegations when addressing the court.

 Justice Lydia Osei Marfo, after considering the submissions from the counsel for the republic, the counsel for the accused, and the accused himself, issued a trial warrant for the second accused.

 In view of the intimation from counsel for the republic, an order is hereby made for a trial warrant to be issued against the second accused person to be kept at the Nsawam Prison and brought to court as needed, the court directed.

 Meanwhile, the court expressed concern over the absence of jurors despite the courts summing up being ready. EIB Networks Legal Affairs Correspondent, Murtala Inusah, reported that the court was expected to sum up the trial and for the jury to return their verdict on Monday, June 24. However, the absence of the jurors, who serve as the judges of facts in the case, resulted in another adjournment.

 Justice Lydia Osei Marfo has adjourned the case to July 8, 2024, hoping the jurors will report for duty. This is the second time the judgment has been deferred, following previous adjournments on May 7 and June 24, 2024.

Help resolve localised conflicts and fight extremism - Community leaders charged,"The National Peace Council has charged community leaders to work together to manage, resolve and prevent localised conflicts and lead advocacy to strengthen social cohesion, as part of efforts to prevent a spill over of activities of violent extremists. 

Mr Ali Anankpieng, the Executive Secretary of the Upper East Regional Peace Council who made the call noted that unresolved conflicts such as chieftaincy, land and farmer-herder related issues at the community level were fertile grounds for perpetuators of violence particularly violent extremists to exploit. 

 He stressed the urgent need for community leaders such as family heads, traditional and religious leaders, opinion leaders and Assembly members among others to work in unison to resolve conflicts in their respective communities and enable them to live in peace. 

The Executive Secretary was speaking to the Ghana News Agency on the sidelines of a stakeholder engagement at Bongo, organised by the National Peace Council as part of the Enhancing Social Cohesion and Social Contract through empowering women and youth in Northern Ghana project. 

The project, which is being implemented in the Bongo, Bawku West and Garu Districts is funded by the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 

The forum which brought together traditional and religious leaders, the Assembly members, women and youth leaders, security services and other state institutions among others from Namoo, Feo and Soe communities aimed to equip the stakeholders with conflict management and resolution skills, techniques to detect violent extremism and political vigilantism among others, to help resolve and prevent conflicts and violent extremism. 

The stakeholders were taken through the linkage between human rights, responsibilities and conflicts and how the denial of ones right could lead to violent conflict. 

Mr Anankpieng noted that greed, discrimination and unfair treatment against minority groups were some of the major causes of the numerous localised conflicts being recorded in the country and underscored the need for community leaders to fight such abuses to promote social cohesion. 

You need to be more vigilant about violent extremism and if you identify something that is suspicious, report to the security services and this year also being an election year, we expect you in the interest of the communities to have one voice and demand for your rights from the political parties, he said. 

Madam Janet Dedei Sarney-Kuma, the Director in charge of Capacity Development and Outreach, National Peace Council, noted that the project aimed to build the resilience of the communities to manage basic conflicts within their communities, to prevent violence and enhance development in Northern Ghana. 

Ms Alice Ndego, the Bongo District Director of the National Commission for Civic Education, noted that the project was timely as the country geared towards the general election and advised the participants to share the knowledge with their communities, to achieve the intended objectives.

Lets lay down guns and embrace peace  Bawku West DCE,"Daniel Anania Atampuba, the District Chief Executive (DCE) of the Bawku West District in the Upper East Region, has called on factions involved in various conflicts in the region to embrace peace. 

He said the conflicts in the region, particularly the protracted Bawku conflict, was spreading beyond Bawku to other parts of the region and the threat of violent activities of extremists was adversely affecting development. 

Mr Atampuba underscored collective efforts to address such issues. 

He said: The conflict in Bawku has affected most of the districts in the Bawku zone. Quite apart from that, the violent extremists activities in Burkina Faso have a potential ripple effect on our District, and it is our responsibility to come together and foster peace. 

It is time to say, lets put our guns down and dialogue and share ideas because taking the gun is not the way to express your dissatisfaction. 

The DCE made the remarks when he addressed stakeholders at a two-day capacity-building workshop organised by the Upper East Regional Peace Council on political vigilantism, advocacy, constitutional rights and responsibilities, among others.  

The stakeholders, including political party activists, opinion leaders, youth groups, and other minority groups, were drawn from Widnaba, Sapelliga, and Kopella communities of the Bawku West District.  

It is being funded by the United Nations (UN) Peacebuilding Fund through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and being implemented in the Bawku West, Garu, and Bongo Districts. 

The project aims at building community resilience towards preventing violence and promoting peace for conflict management, resolution, and social cohesion.  

Madam Jenet Dedei Sarney-Kuma, the Director of Capacity Development and Outreach, National Peace Council, noted that though some of the conflicts that existed in the communities were not difficult to manage, the managers of such conflicts sometimes lacked the required knowledge and skills to resolve them. 

She said this necessitated the need for the capacities of the stakeholders to be built to help them manage conflict among themselves, recognize the rights of others and their responsibilities, and champion peace for national development. 

This knowledge they gain can be applied to manage election disputes, so we are believing that as we build their capacities, we will have fewer election troubles and general disputes within the district, she added.  

Mr Awinbon Yakubu, a youth leader, Sapelliga community, said the workshop had well positioned him to help manage conflict in his community as it had exposed him to a lot of issues concerning conflict management and human rights that he previously did not know. 

Mr Job Akpalimtera Nyaba, the Assemblyman from the Widnaba community, lauded the efforts of the Peace Council for building peace and called on the youth to be peace advocates. 

Mr Edmond Alagpulinsa, a Human Rights Officer and facilitator of the workshop, urged the stakeholders to be circumspect about cultural practices that violated the rights and dignity of others, as they were punishable by law.",,Regional, 23 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Let-s-lay-down-guns-and-embrace-peace-Bawku-West-DCE-1936928

Telecel Ghana employee volunteers plant over 5000 trees in massive reforestation effort,"Over 60 employee volunteers from telecommunications giant, Telecel Ghana in partnership with the Forestry Commission joined forces with young students from Luom Basic Schools and Ghana International School (GIS) to plant thousands of seedlings to replace lost forest cover at the Chipa Tributary Forest Reserve in Agomeda.

As a way of furthering Telecel Ghanas commitment to environmental sustainability and in line with the Green Ghana agenda, senior management, and employee volunteers dedicated their day to reforestation for a greener future. 

Chief Executive Officer of Telecel Ghana, Ing. Patricia Obo-Nai emphasised the importance of collective action to increase green cover and protect the environment. She said, ""As a telco that operates with a purpose, this annual initiative is our contribution to sustaining the environment.""

As part of our ESG strategy, we continue to partner with various stakeholders such as the Forestry Commission to create a sustainable environment for people and animals. This year, our employees, together with the school children are planting over 5000 seedlings to preserve the Chipa Tributary Forest Reserve.

Gazetted as a reserve in 1968, the Chipa Tributary Forest Reserve in Agomeda in the Greater Accra Region serves as a habitat for animals and conserves the tributary that flows into the Dawhenya Dam. However, forestry officials reported that bushfires and firewood harvesting have destroyed around 50 hectares out of the reserve's total 2,410 hectares. 

Mrs. Winifred Ohene-Wiafe, Manager for the Tema-Ada Forest District said, We need more trees to offset the effect of urbanisation which has led to more buildings being put up and the depletion of trees in our cities. Tree planting is a worthy course so I will encourage every individual and institution to partake in reforestation to improve our environment.

For Michela, a third-year secondary student of GIS, this is her first planting experience, and it has sparked an interest in reforestation. Tree planting is important as it helps to restore areas that are depleted. Its been a fun experience planting together with employees of Telecel Ghana and other students to improve air and environment quality. Im excited that I am being part of making an impact.

Ernest, a basic nine pupil and member of the Wildlife Club at the Luom Presbyterian School, located in one of the reserves host communities, believes the tree planting exercise will help address climate change. ""Theres a saying that when the last tree dies, the last man dies. Joining to plant trees today will help purify the air we breathe and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. I advise other young people to plant trees to reduce global warming and the impact of climate change.",,Regional, 23 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Telecel-Ghana-employee-volunteers-plant-over-5000-trees-in-massive-reforestation-effort-1936910

Okyenhene advocates for incentives to enhance quality education,"Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin has called for improved incentives for teachers, particularly those assigned to rural areas, to enhance the delivery of quality education.

This call comes amid concerns about a high attrition rate among teachers in Ghana and persistent shortages in rural areas.

Last year, Dr. Christian Addai-Poku, Registrar of the National Teaching Council, revealed that over 16,000 Ghanaian teachers had applied for positions in the UKs Department of Education.

By June 13, 2023, 10,000 of these applicants, holding Ghana Teacher Licenses, had been certified to work in the UK without further assessment.

This compounds the high attrition rate among the teaching profession in the country due to poor conditions of service.

Many schools in rural areas do not have adequate teachers due to a lack of incentives.

Okyenhene Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin believes that providing infrastructure and laptops to schools is ineffective if there are no quality teachers to utilize these resources to teach students.

He is advocating for special incentives for teachers posted to rural areas.

The overlord of Akyem Abuakwa touted the Free SHS program and urged parents to take advantage of it to provide secondary education to their children.

Okyenhene cautioned against teenage pregnancy and irresponsible parenting, which lead to an increase in child neglect and school dropouts.

At a Royal Durbar organized by the Benkum Division in honor of Okyenhenes 25th-anniversary celebration, he assured attendees in Begoro that a new chief would soon be installed to occupy the vacant stool, which has been empty for five years, to help facilitate development in the area.

Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin underscored the importance of community stability and warned against land and chieftaincy disputes in the Fanteakwa area.

"AbibiNsroma Foundation: Day of the African Child, honouring the past, shaping the future","The Day of the African Child 2024, celebrated annually on June 16th, is a day of reflection and advocacy for the rights and well-being of children across the African continent.

 This significant day commemorates the 1976 Soweto Uprising, where thousands of black schoolchildren in South Africa took to the streets to protest against the inferior quality of their education and to demand their right to be taught in their own language. The peaceful protest turned tragic when hundreds of young students were brutally killed by the apartheid regime.

 The Soweto Uprising was a pivotal moment in the struggle against apartheid and highlighted the courage and resilience of African children. The Day of the African Child was established by the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union) in 1991 to honor the memory of those who participated in the Soweto Uprising and to recognize the ongoing struggles faced by African children.

 Despite progress in some areas, many African children continue to face significant challenges, including limited access to quality education, child labor, early marriage, and inadequate healthcare.

 These issues are further compounded by poverty, political instability, and social inequalities. The Day of the African Child serves as a reminder of the urgent need to address these challenges and to promote the rights and well-being of all children in Africa. The Day of the African Child is marked by a specific theme that focuses on a particular issue affecting African children.

 In 2024, the theme is ""Education for all children in Africa: the time is now."" This year, AbibiNsroma Foundation emphasizes the need to eliminate practices such as child marriage, female genital mutilation, and child labor, which continue to hinder the development and well-being of children across the continent.

 AbibiNsroma Foundation is drawing the attention of Governments, non-governmental organizations, and communities to take concrete actions to protect and promote the rights of African children.

 This includes implementing and enforcing laws and policies that safeguard children's rights, increasing investment in education and healthcare, and raising awareness about the harmful effects of certain cultural practices.

 The Day of the African Child is also an opportunity to celebrate the achievements and potential of African children. By providing them with the necessary tools and opportunities, we can empower the next generation to become leaders and change-makers who will shape a brighter future for Africa.

 This involves not only addressing immediate needs but also creating an environment where children can thrive and reach their full potential. As we commemorate the Day of the African Child, AbibiNsroma encourages us to honor the memory of those who fought for their rights and continue to advocate for the rights and well-being of all African children. By working together, we can create a future where every child in Africa has the opportunity to grow, learn, and succeed.",,Regional, 21 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/AbibiNsroma-Foundation-Day-of-the-African-Child-honouring-the-past-shaping-the-future-1936659

Wa Killings: Blame systemic failure for re-emergence of serial killers - Wa Naa,"Wa Naa Fuseini Pelpuo IV, Overlord of the Wala Traditional Area has blamed ""systemic failure"" on the part of the State Security apparatus, traditional leaders, and residents as being responsible for the recent murders in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region.

 Residents on Tuesday, June 18, woke up to another chilling news of the killing of private security guards in the Wa Municipality reminiscent of a similar fashion that rocked the town some two years ago, with two persons having their lives cruelly taken from them in a single night on this occasion.

 Following the previous serial killings about two years ago, over two dozen suspects were apprehended by the Police. Still, since then, nothing has been heard of the case by residents until the current incident which has sent shockwaves down the spines of the people who are fearing for the worst.

 The Overlord in a Press Statement believes that it is because everyone had gone to sleep after some suspects were arrested during the previous killings, letting down their guard hence, the recurring of the dastardly act by the unknown dark forces whose modus operandi remains a mystery, at least, for now.

 ""This has happened before and we raised red flags everywhere, but soon forgot of it and let down our guard. What has happened is a systemic failure. The fault is at the doorsteps of the State Security apparatus, the traditional authorities, and more especially, residents in the Municipality,"" Wa Naa Fuseini Pelpuo IV said.

 According to the Overlord, even though it is the mandate of the State Security apparatus to ensuring there is peace and security for the people, which he indicated, can only be achieved when assisted with the relevant information and tip-offs to act which he said the people are reluctant to do.

 He blamed residents for their wanton desire to shield criminal elements in society for ""inexplicable reasons.""

 ""While the State Security apparatus is responsible for the maintenance of peace and security, it can only succeed if we support it with relevant information. The perpetrators of these heinous murders live among us. They can hardly commit these murders without being noticed by one or a number of people. The fact is, for inexplicable reasons, we shield them,"" his royal Highness lamented.

 While outlining a plethora of measures arrived at from a meeting between the Wala Traditional Council and the Regional Security Council (REGSEC) following the barbaric spectacle, the Overlord called on the Police to update the people with findings of the arrested suspects on the previous killings to help rekindle the spirit of volunteerism among the youth who are ready to assist them in bringing the situation under control.

 Bodies of the two private security men were discovered at separate locations - Wa Model JHS and Wa East Education Service office - both in Wa Municipal, triggering a probe into the circumstances that led to their murder.
