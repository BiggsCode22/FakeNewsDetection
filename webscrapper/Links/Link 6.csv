Investing in innovators to unlock limitless opportunities,"For the first time, I have a clear direction for my innovation. I learned how to approach problems in a structured way and set achievable goals to help grow my innovation, said Mark Sarfo, participant from the Young Africa Innovates (YAI) programme pilot BootCamp.

Mark is a young Ghanaian innovator who is passionate about finding solutions to tackle challenges in his community in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. But, like many others, he faced a major hurdle - lack of guidance and support- until he joined the Young Africa Innovates (YAI) programme.

The bootcamp connected me to great experts who have given me the tools and confidence to turn my ideas into reality, and Im excited as this will greatly impact my business and help me make a meaningful difference in my community Mark added.

The YAI programme aims to empower marginalized youth, especially women, persons living in rural communities, and persons with disabilities, to turn their ideas into reality.

Through the YAI pilot bootcamp organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ghana, the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), and other partners, Mark including other innovators gained access to expert training and mentorship. He learned how to refine his innovation and build a successful business.

Addressing the innovators during the pilot bootcamp, the YAI Programme Chief Technical Advisor, Allen Anie, stated that At UNDP, we believe that every young person has the potential to drive positive change, regardless of their gender, location, or background. That is why the YAI programme is designed to support those who are marginalized and provide them with the resources and support they need to succeed, he stated.

Lydia Takyi, an Entrepreneurship/Career and Employability Coach at the pilot bootcamp shares her excitement as she reflected on the innovators' progress, saying, I was happy to see how quickly they grabbed the concepts and adapted to the design thinking approach. Their ability to think creatively, and develop innovative solutions was truly impressive. It's clear that these young innovators have the potential to drive meaningful change in their communities and beyond, Lydia expressed. 

Director of Business Support and Policy at National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), Franklin Owusu-Karikari noted that, Unlocking the potential of young innovators is crucial for Ghana's economic growth and development, and NEIP remains committed to working with its partners to provide the necessary support and resources to help the innovators succeed.""

With the support of UNDP and the Mastercard Foundation, YAI is paving the way for a brighter future for Ghana's youth, providing a platform for innovators like Mark to thrive. 

As the bootcamps progress, the stories and successes of these young innovators will continue to be shared, highlighting the transformative power of inclusive innovation. Stay tuned for more updates and inspiring stories from the Young Africa Innovates programme.",,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Investing-in-innovators-to-unlock-limitless-opportunities-1938053
"Asantes are courageous, decisive and contributes to national development - Asantehene to US Consul General","Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II has described the people of Ashanti as courageous, dedicated, and industrious individuals who contribute significantly to national development.

Plot to attack Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade uncovered,"The Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade has reported that landguards working for an unnamed estate developer within Adoagyiri and Okanta have planned a reprisal attack against them.

 The brigade intercepted the plot in a voice recording on a certain WhatsApp platform.

 Addressing the media at Kyebi over the weekend, Okyeman Akwansrahene Baffour Asiedu Bekoe stated that the land guards, posing as police informants, are part of a syndicate terrorizing farmers and landowners in Okanta and its surrounding areas.

 He explained that the Environmental Protection Brigade received reports of land guards terrorizing residents of Okanta, arrested them, and handed them over to the police at Kyebi.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe noted that the police released the suspects after 48 hours and then conspired to attack members of the Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade.

 The Okyeman Akwansrahene revealed that the land guards circulated pictures of the brigade's leaders on a WhatsApp platform, inciting their members to target them.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe has reported the plot to the police, which is currently under investigation.

 This incident follows the killing of 28-year-old Ofei Noah, a member of the brigade, who was murdered two months ago.

 Noah was killed, and three brigade members sustained multiple gunshot wounds while returning from their usual patrol around Adeiso. They were ambushed in a nearby village.

 Ofei Noah was laid to rest over the weekend.

 Meanwhile, Baffour Asiedu Bekoe asserts that the Environmental Protection Brigade will not be intimidated by the threats and will not abandon its duty to protect Okyeman's property.

 He declared that all lands from Adoagyiri to Jejeti, Dome Faase, Asamankese, Adeiso, and their environs remain the property of the Overlord of the Akyem Abuakwa State, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin.

 As a result, any transfer of lands without the consent and agreement of the Okyenhene is invalid.

 He advised all parties who have acquired lands from third parties to visit the Okyeman Stool Lands secretariat at Kyebi to regularize their documents or face consequences.

 Baffour Asiedu Bekoe urged security agencies to assist in curbing the landguard problem in the area.

 He affirmed that the Okyeman Environmental Protection Brigade was founded to safeguard Okyeman's property, and they are committed to this mission.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Plot-to-attack-Okyeman-Environmental-Protection-Brigade-uncovered-1938040
Accra Durbar of Chiefs: Youth urged to embrace peace,"Prominent chiefs and political party representatives gathered at Sabon Zongo, a suburb of Accra, to mark this year's Greater Accra Zongo Durbar of Chiefs with a common call on the youth to embrace peace ahead of the December elections.

The durbar aims to bring together Muslim tribal chiefs, traditional chiefs, queen mothers, politicians, and youth from all walks of life with the purpose of promoting peace ahead of the December 7, 2024 elections, as well as raising funds for the construction of Islamic schools in the Sabon Zongo community.

The durbar, themed ""Ensuring Peaceful Elections in December 2024: The Role of the Youth and Traditional Leaders,"" was held under the auspices of the Greater Accra Zongo Chief, Dr. Sarki Alhaji Yahaya Hamisu Bako.

Alhaji Abdul Jalil Abubakar, the chairman of the Greater Accra durbar committee, in an interview with the media on the sidelines of the durbar, called on the youth to make peace their topmost priority ahead of the December polls.

He urged the youth to consider children and women before engaging in any form of violence before, during, and after the elections, adding that children and women suffer the most during any conflict.

He said there is a need to promote peace and say no to politics or any form of violence in the country.

He advised his fellow youth not to allow themselves to be used as tools for political violence and urged them to be bold and reject any offer from politicians who may come to them to commit crimes.

The Development Queen Mother of Osu Ashante, Manye Naa Odofeley Wornor I, who was represented by Sherifatu Abdulahi, used the opportunity to call on mothers to advise their children on the need to promote peace.

According to her, mothers have some form of influence on their children; hence, there is a need for mothers to add their voices to the call for peace before, during, and after the December elections.

She revealed that most politicians have enrolled their children in universities abroad to become better people but turned around to use the ordinary Ghanaian youth during elections for their political gains.

She, therefore, called on mothers to advise their children not to engage in any form of violence for the benefit of politicians.

Manye Naa Odofeley Wornor I donated an amount of GHC 500 for the construction of madrasas (Islamic school projects) in Sabon Zongo, Accra.", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Accra-Durbar-of-Chiefs-Youth-urged-to-embrace-peace-1938038
NSS saves GHC112 million through IT infrastructure,"Under the leadership of its current director, Mr. Osei Asibbey Antwi, the National Service Scheme (NSS) has saved Ghana over GHC122 million through IT infrastructure.

Why the Asantehene bathes with water from the River Tano once every year  Obiri Boahen,"Did you know that every Asantehene is supposed to have a ritual bath with water from the Tano River, which flows for 400 kilometers from Traa in the Bono East Region to the Aby Lagoon in Ivory Coast, once every year?

Lawyer Nana Obiri Boahen, in an interview with the Xpress Media Network, explained the history behind this ritual.

He shared that every Asantehene in the Ashanti Kingdom has bathed with water from the River Tano once every year since 1717, and the water must come from a specific section of the river - Tano Obuasi.

He mentioned that the ritual originated after it was discovered that the river possessed a powerful force when communities along the river aided the Ashantis in winning the 1717 war.

""When the Ashantis were preparing to fight the Jameriwa war in 1717, the people of Tepa, Buadeduro, Tanoso, Tsumpuduo, Tano, Boatsiniwa, all supported the Ashantis.

""Therefore, since 1717, anyone who holds the title of Asanteman is required to bathe with water from the Tano River once every year. They collect water from the river for him to use, and they fetch it from Tano Obuasi,"" he explained in Twi.

He noted that the river contains powerful spirits, and only at its banks in Tano Obuasi can curses from potent deities be reversed.

""The River Tano holds a spirit. It is even challenging to see the river alongside Bosomtwe... if someone curses you with Antoa and you wish to reverse it, you can only do so at Tano Obuasi,"" he emphasized.

Ghanas leading digital news platform, GhanaWeb, in conjunction with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, is embarking on an aggressive campaign which is geared towards ensuring that parliament passes comprehensive legislation to guide organ harvesting, organ donation, and organ transplantation in the country.",,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Why-the-Asantehene-bathes-with-water-from-the-River-Tano-once-every-year-Obiri-Boahen-1938036
Eyes on the Ground: Passengers along Ho-Asikuma-Juapong Road completely stranded as road collapses,"GhanaWeb has reliably been informed that the road connecting Ho to Juapong has been cut off due to heavy rains on June 29, 2024.

Dont kill yourselves as a way to find solutions to address problems  Minister,"Mr. Stephen Yakubu, the Upper West Regional Minister, has described as worrying and abnormal the actions of people who kill one another to address problems with their neighbors.

""There is no need to kill one another; the elders are there, the security agencies are there, and the law courts are there to help address disputes and misunderstandings amicably without the shedding of blood,"" he said.

He stated that it was always better for the people in the communities to work together to sustain peace and explore pragmatic ways and means to address conditions of poverty, which had over the years plagued them and hindered their overall well-being and development, rather than killing themselves at the least provocation.

Mr. Yakubu raised these concerns at separate meetings with the traditional rulers and the youth of Wechiau, Kandeu, and Lassia in the Wa West District to share his sympathies and listen to them following the killing of three young men at Lassia during a communal clash between the people of Kandeu and Lassia communities on June 15, 2024.

He said poverty should be considered the common and topmost enemy of the people and that it was only through peaceful co-existence and ensuring a conducive environment that they could work to overcome poverty and underdevelopment.

""Problems are always with us on a daily basis, but we need to continually sit and dialogue to find amicable solutions to them, rather than killing ourselves as a way of solving them,"" he said.

""You must know what conflict does to the people and what peace also does to the people. The difference between them is that conflict is a threat to human existence, while peace is the lifewire of human development and well-being,"" he added.

Mr. Yakubu pleaded with the traditional authorities, especially the chiefs and the landlords, to engage with stakeholders to work assiduously to resolve all issues pertaining to land and chieftaincy disputes in the area, as that had been a bone of contention that ignited the clashes between the two communities.

He advised the youth to be law-abiding and avoid associating the clashes with politics, as that could aggravate the situation and derail the peace processes ""since this is an election year.""

The Regional Minister warned that any agitator who would want to escalate the issues to achieve his or her selfish interest would not be spared by the security agencies on the ground.

He also assured the bereaved families that the perpetrators of the murder of the three persons would be made to face the full rigors of the law.

Naa Imoru Nandon Gomah, the Paramount Chief of the Wechiau Traditional Council, commended the security agencies for their professionalism that had returned peace to the district.

He assured Mr. Yakubu and the security agencies of the Council's unflinching support to ensure peace to enable the people to go about their farming activities and other businesses in the area.

The Wechiau Naa appealed to the Regional Police Command to release the dead bodies to the bereaved families on time for burial to help cool down tempers.

He requested an increase in the number of security personnel on the burial day of the deceased to take care of any unforeseen disturbances.",,Regional, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Don-t-kill-yourselves-as-a-way-to-find-solutions-to-address-problems-Minister-1937990
