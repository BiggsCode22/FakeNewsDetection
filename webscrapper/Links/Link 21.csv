"IMF: Ghana has fulfilled obligations, awaiting creditor action on debt restructuring","The Director of the African Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Abebe Aemro Selassie, has confirmed that Ghana has taken the required steps to secure the long-awaited financing assurance from its external creditors.
He added that the IMF is patiently awaiting responses from bilateral creditors.
“I have to tell you that whereas it took something like nine months or more for Zambia to get the official creditor committee to be created, in Ghana’s case, it was fairly rapid…Ghana has done its fair share and it’s for the creditors to take steps,” Mr. Selassie said when addressing journalists following the publication of Africa’s Regional Outlook Report during the Annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco.



He added “We’re not going to be asking the government to do more adjustment because creditors haven’t asked either. We will provide all the information necessary, so creditors can move, allowing us to go to the Board as soon as possible.”
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta earlier disclosed that Ghana had secured assurances from both China and France regarding the Memorandum of Outstanding (MoU) for the restructuring of the country’s external bilateral debts.
“We have met the Central Bank Governor of China and we don’t perceive any opposition or reluctance in participating positively when it comes to the Memorandum of Understanding on restructuring of our external bilateral debts” the finance minister said.
Responding to inquiries from journalists at the Annual International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr Ofori-Atta added, “The Chinese government within the past months is close to reaching a similar deal with Zambia, Sri Lanka and Suriname, so following that trend, we expect some similar cooperation from them when it comes to Ghana”.
Mr Ofori-Atta in an earlier interview described the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings as an opportunity for a new beginning for the global financial architecture.
In his remarks at a Roundtable Discussion on “IMF Policy Priorities,” Mr Ofori-Atta charged the IMF to strengthen the global financial safety net through bold reforms to the global financial architecture.
During the Roundtable hosted by US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Mr Ofori-Atta praised the transformative leadership of IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, which has led to the achievement of truly momentous things.
He however continued, “We need to stretch the IMF to do more. The need is great. And at these Annual Meetings, the developing world is asking the international community to do all it can to advance a reform agenda that ensures institutions like the IMF have the requisite mandates, financing, and governance models to deliver transformative impact.”",citibusinessnews,"Featured, Local Economy","October 16, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-ghana-has-fulfilled-obligations-awaiting-creditor-action-on-debt-restructuring/
"IMF, World Bank work to accelerate debt treatment for Ghana, others under G20","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are working together to accelerate debt restructuring for Ghana and other countries under the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework.
Ms Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF said this during a plenary meeting at the 2023 IMF/WGB Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“The IMF and the World Bank are bringing all relevant creditors and debtors together with promising signs,” the IMF Managing Director said.



She explained that the two global financial institutions were doing so because the progress of the Common Framework on delivering on debt restructurings had been slow. The move is one of the supporting-pillars of the two-thronged “no regrets” actions for the next fifty years, captured in the Marrakech Principles, aimed at closing the divergent global income gap and generate job-rich growth for all.
The two policy actions are – investment in strong economic foundations, and investment in global cooperation.
More than half of low-income countries remained in or were at risk of debt distress, with about half of emerging economies facing default-like debt spreads. That, Ms Georgieva, said required prompt delivery of debt treatment, which would be beneficial to both creditors and debtors.
On the Fund’s support beyond pushing for speedy debt negotiations, she said, about US$1 trillion in liquidity and financing had been provided to countries across the world since the
“This came via the US$650bn Special Drawing Right (SDR) and US$320bn in lending to 96 countries, including 56 low-income nations,” she said.
“Our meetings here in Marrakech, the Red, leave me in no doubt that, together, we will unlock the door to opportunities for the next generation,” the IMF Managing Director said.
“Debt has increased throughout emerging markets – doubling in Africa – shackling
countries to the ground just as they’re trying to rise, Mr Banga, the World Bank President
noted.
He said it had become important to reimagine partnerships and have innovative plans to address the debt and other economic and climate change challenges for a liveable planet.
“We took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing US$40bn over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio,” the World Bank President said.
He added that the Bank had also created a portfolio guarantee mechanism, together with the launch of a hybrid capital instrument to enable it take risks and boost its lending capacity, the more.
“Taken together, we could provide US$157bn more in lending over a decade,” Mr Banga
said.
Immediate steps were taken to lessen the debt burden of low-income countries after the COVID-19 pandemic, where countries called on the IMF and World Bank to lend their support to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).
This was after a decision by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting to endorse the suspension of debt service of most vulnerable countries of under the Group.
Further action was taken later on in 2020 by the G20 Finance Ministers in endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI to facilitate the timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries.
Since then, Ghana, Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia have requested for debt restructuring, and
are at various stages of deals with Official Creditors.
Ghana, for example, looks forward to signing a pact with external creditors for a second tranche of US$600m from IMF, Zambia reached an agreement on Saturday, October 14, 2023, and awaiting official signing of agreement.

Zambia advises Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation,"Mr Situmbeko Musokotwane, Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zambia, has advised Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation.
“We put a law in Parliament which tied my hands to say, going forward, you can’t be like those in the past. So, we tied our hands for Parliament to have more power and restrictions on borrowing,” he said.
That should be combined with reforms to maintain credibility with creditors, international community, and citizens, as well as create a conducive environment for private sector investment for value addition.



He expressed confidence that such action would hasten the processes of concluding debt treatment, grow the
economy, increase domestic revenue, create more jobs and uplift the living standards of people, and help avoid future debt crisis.
Minister Musokotwane said this as he shared the experience of Zambian authorities, who on Saturday, October 14, 2023, formalised on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with its Official Creditors on restructuring of some US$6.3 billion debt.
Zambia, the first African country to default on its debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, reached an agreement in
principle in June, and currently awaiting to sign an MoU for the restructuring of its debt.
He spoke at the African Finance Ministers press briefing on Saturday, October 14, 2023, in Marrakech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG) Annual Meetings.
He explained that it was important for the country to take prudent measures not to accumulate high debts by having strong structural and sustainable reforms, while investing in education, healthcare, infrastructure and industrialisation.
“To get the support of the international community – lenders and other people, obviously, must conclude that you’re worthy of their support, and willing to take steps to assist yourself,” he noted.
“We’ve learnt a lot, and for people like you [Ghana], you’ve been lucky,” Mr Musokotwane said, with respect to Ghana gaining external creditors assurance and securing an IMF programme in five months.
Among others, Ghana has a Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2018 (Act 982), which requires government not to spend beyond a threshold that would push fiscal deficit above five per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
However, it was suspended in 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the government envisaged that it would not meet the five per cent deficit threshold.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance and B Bank of Ghana (BoG) have signed an MoU, providing for zero monetary financing throughout the IMF US$3 billion loan-support programme with Ghana.
Meanwhile, Ghana’s economic growth had averaged 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters of 2023, something that Dr. Ernest Addison, Governor, BoG, explained, should make government “operate without access to central bank financing.”

"2024 budget: Government commits to more expenditure cuts, aggressive growth, jobs","The government has assured Ghanaians that it will safeguard current economic gains, and make it reflect in the living conditions of everyone in the coming months.
To this end, there would be more expenditure reduction measures in the 2024 budget, as well as policies to consolidate macroeconomic gains, ensuring that inflation and exchange rate are tamed.
Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Finance Minister and Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, Information Minister, gave the
assurances on Friday evening ahead of the budget presentation in November.



They spoke on the sidelines of the 2023 International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG)
Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“You’ll see more prudent fiscal measures in the 2024 budget to keep the macroeconomy stable so that inflation continues to go down and the currency remains stable. That’s an assurance from government that will surely happen” Mr Ofori-Atta said.
“We’ll also find various incentives and resources into the growth agenda that we have to catalyse the
private sector to thrive,” the Minister pledged during a press briefing.
The government introduced a number of cost-cutting measures in the 2023 budget, including, a freeze on
employment in the public sector, reduction in salaries of some government officials, aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability.
In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Nkrumah said those measures had started yielding
positive results, but the government would do more, which would be specified in the 2024 budget.
“Although we don’t have the final figures, one of the clearest ways to examine the performance of the measures to reduce expenditure is to look at the primary balance, and there’s a clear indication that we’re doing well to stay within the revenue envelope that we have,” he said.
Ghana’s primary balance – the difference between the amount of revenue the government collects and
spends on providing public goods and services, excluding debt payment, was −1.3 as of the first half of
2022, but stood at 0.6 the same period, 2023.
Reiterating government’s commitment to fiscal discipline, Mr Nkrumah said: “Going forward, our focus is
to stay on that path to ensure that we don’t blow the fiscals out of gear.”
Some Civil Society Groups, Economists and Governance experts in the country have been calling for a
reduction in the number of ministers and government officials as part of measure to maintain fiscal
discipline, but that is yet to happen.
They have also encouraged the government to be more aggressive on collecting property taxes, incentivize to rope the informal sector into the tax net, and reduce the rate of the Electronic Transactions Levy (E-levy) to about 0.5 per cent from the one per cent.
That they expressed confidence in increasing domestic revenue to support expenditure reduction measures, making the economy more robust.

With a relentless commitment to serving its customers better, the Bank has consistently led the way in redefining banking in Ghana through innovative solutions. One significant milestone in Zenith’s innovation journey was its pioneering venture into online banking, revolutionizing the way customers managed their finances.

The Bank continues to deepen its engagement with customers and its accessibility to them through initiatives such as its 24hour Customer Contact Centre, Zenith Direct, which features channels such as Z-Chat (an online live chat platform), the Complaints Portal, Voice Calls, and Email – where customers can seek information about products and services, provide service feedback to the Bank, or report complaints. The Bank’s unwavering commitment to a customer-centric approach, characterized by open communication and support for clients during difficult times has fostered trust and loyalty.

In commemoration of the 18th Anniversary celebration, Zenith Bank Ghana organised a prayer and thanksgiving service to thank the Almighty God for 18 successful years of Banking operations in Ghana.

A key highlight of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary celebration was the Bank’s presentation of a cheque of GHS150,000 to the Pediatric Oncology Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).  The presentation, which was in furtherance of the Bank’s CSR objective of giving back to the society in which it operates was in response to an appeal by Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG), a non-governmental organization dedicated to making childhood cancer a national health priority whilst facilitating and increasing access to optimal medical care and treatment for children with cancer.
Speaking at the presentation, the MD/CEO stated that, “When Akua Sarpong, the Co-founder and Executive Directive of Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG) spoke with our colleagues about the cause she is championing, we saw that it is one that needed some form of assistance especially from corporate institutions, and we readily and willingly supported this very worthy cause as September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month globally as well as the month of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary”.
Speaking on behalf of LCCG and the Oncology Unit, Prof. Lorna Reinner, Pediatric Oncologist at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital who spoke on behalf of the Pediatric Oncology Unit expressed appreciation to Zenith Bank for the very kind gesture. She indicated that the LCCG and the hospital are currently working towards the expansion of the pediatric oncology block to increase the current facility’s capacity to include a 40-bed children’s ward to enable the hospital improve treatment and care for patients; as such the Bank’s donation which was apt and timely and would go towards the construction of the new ward.
Prof. Reinner thus noted that increased support from other corporate institutions would greatly help the unit improve treatment outcomes for children with cancer and their families given the needed support.
Prior to the presentation at the Pediatric Oncology Units, earlier in the week, the Bank organised a Virtual Health Talk for staff on “Childhood Cancer –to create awareness of Childhood cancer and to educate staff on the signs, symptoms, preventive measures and treatment options available for patients.
Also, during the anniversary celebration, the Bank organised a two-week EazyBanking activation exercise at all 40 business locations nationwide to sign customers on to the Bank’s digital banking products such as Internet Banking, Zenith Mobile Banking App (ZMobile), Cards, Point of Sale Terminals, Scan To Pay, etc).

For every customer that signed up for a product, they received an instant gift from the Bank to the delight of many.
The Bank’s online audience was not left out of the celebration as followers of the Bank’s social media pages also enjoyed fun and interactive games and rewards that kept them glued to the pages.
To climax the celebration, the Bank organised a TGIF/Karaoke Night across all branches to appreciate staff for their hard work, loyalty and commitment to the success of the Bank.

Former Capital Bank CEO Ato Essien jailed 15 years,"Former Chief Executive Officer of defunct Capital Bank, Ato Essien has been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with hard labour.
This follows his failure to pay in full an amount of GH¢90 million he agreed to pay the state despite several lifelines given him since December 2022.
Ato Essien pleaded guilty to 16 counts of stealing, money laundering and conspiracy to steal for his role in the collapse of Capital Bank.



He however entered a plea bargain with the state under section 35(7) of the courts ACT 459.
Under the agreement, Mr. Essien was expected to pay GH¢90 million for which he paid GH¢30 million cedis on December 13.
He was to pay the GH¢60 million remainder in three equal instalments in 2023; GH¢20 million by April 28, another GH¢20 million by August 31 and the last GH¢20 million by December 15, 2023.
A major condition of the agreement was that the court would not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence if he missed any of the payment deadlines.
But as of April 28, Mr. Essien had not paid all the GH¢20 million due to be settled.
The state filed an application on May 2, 2023, to get a custodial sentence imposed on the convict (Ato Essien).
But that application was not heard as the presiding judge, Justice Eric Kyei Baffour gave him (Ato Essien) about six months to redeem himself.
But between January this year to October 12, Ato Essien has only paid GH¢7 million in addition to the GH¢30 million previously paid.
With GH¢53 million of the agreed sum outstanding, the judge having exhausted his patience allowed the state to move the application.
The judge upon hearing the application jailed Ato Essien to spend 15 years in prison.",citibusinessnews,"Bankg And Fance, Featured","October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/former-capital-bank-ceo-ato-essien-jailed-15-years/
IMF clarifies Ghanas growth rate projection,"The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Resident Representative in Ghana, Dr. Leandro Medina, has clarified that the growth rate for the country has not been revised to 1.2% from the May 2023 forecast of 1.5%.
Dr. Medina explained that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection of 1.2% growth for 2023 is based on an old set of projections that do not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2% for the first two quarters).
He added that based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, the IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5% previously assumed.



Various media portals reported that the IMF had lowered Ghana’s growth rate to 1.2% making it the second time the Fund had revised Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for 2023.
But Dr Medina in a statement clarifying the issue said “The latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection (1.2 per cent growth for 2023) is based on an old vintage of Fund staff projections. In particular, it does not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters).
“At the current juncture, and based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5 percent previously assumed.”

Stéphane Roudet, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Mission Chief to Ghana in an interview on the Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, October 9 also lauded Ghana’s economic growth.
Mr Roudet intimated that Ghana’s quick economic recovery is surprising and also encouraging, as the country has outperformed the IMF’s projection for the year 2023.
He indicated that the IMF had projected Ghana’s economy to grow at a rate of 1.5 percent by the year ending 2023, but the first-half report shows that the country’s economy is growing at a rate of 3 percent, which he said is very encouraging and will go a long way to ensuring the smooth disbursement of the second tranche of the $3 billion credit facility from the Fund.
“Ghana’s economic activities I have to say, have surprised us on the outside. You will remember that in the programme, we were projecting economic growth of 1.5 percent for this year, and now we have the outcome for the first half of the year, and we are about 3 percent and so you can see that there are signs that are encouraging.”",citibusinessnews,Busess,"October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-clarifies-ghanas-growth-rate-projection/

IMF awaits Ghanas agreement with bilateral creditors before releasing next tranche of $3bn bailout,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it is waiting for the outcome of Ghana’s engagement with its bilateral creditors before releasing the next tranche of the $3 billion bailout package.
This was disclosed by the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, in a tweet on Wednesday after meeting Ghanaian officials to discuss the way forward.
Ghana recently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF following a review of the country’s economic progress after the first tranche of $600 million was disbursed.



Georgieva congratulated Ghana on securing the staff-level agreement.
In a tweet, she said “Great to meet @MoF_Ghana Min Ofori-Atta & @thebankofghana Gov Addison at #IMFMeetings. Congrats on the recent staff-level agreement on the Fund-supported program’s first review. Counting on bilateral creditors reaching agreement on debt relief soon to move the review forward.”
The IMF and Ghana reached a staff-level agreement on October 6 on economic policies and reforms to conclude the first review of the country’s three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility.
This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and receipt of the necessary financing assurances.
The IMF has praised Ghana’s strong policy and reform commitment under the program, which it says is bearing fruit and leading to signs of economic stabilization.
In a report, the IMF noted that growth in 2023 has proven more resilient than initially envisaged, inflation has declined, the fiscal and external positions have improved, and the exchange rate has stabilized.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has appealed to its bilateral creditors to quickly agree on current debt relief terms to enable Ghana to secure the second tranche of the package from the IMF.

Development Bank Ghana set to diversify financial offerings by introducing equity fund alongside lending activities.,"DBG’s Chief Executive Officer, K. Duker, unveiled the bank’s plans for this equity fund, aimed at expanding the range of financial products available to both institutions and borrowers at different stages of development.
DBG, established in June 2022, has already disbursed GH¢731 million across various sectors, contributing to Ghana’s economic growth and development. Mr. Duker shared the bank’s vision for the future, stating, “Our vision is clear, and our processes are streamlined. With our enhanced lending system, we’ve become more efficient, enabling faster disbursements to our partners. By the end of 2023, we aim to have disbursed an impressive GH¢1 billion.”
“We’re in the final stages of launching an equity fund. Initially, it will be relatively small, but when your only tool is lending, everything seems like a loan, which isn’t always the case. So, we need to offer other products,” emphasized Mr. Duker.



“We are currently in the final stages of regulatory approval to establish an equity fund, which will provide us with more patient capital. This will allow us to offer equity, loans, and other products to the market, creating a virtuous circle of diverse products suitable for different stages of an institution’s or borrower’s journey.”
DBG’s focus extends beyond becoming the largest lender in Ghana, emphasizing its commitment to transforming the private sector. Mr. Duker added, “If I become the largest lender without transforming the private sector, I would have failed.”
Established by the government, DBG serves as a Development Finance Institution with the primary goal of facilitating and strengthening long-term financing for Ghanaian businesses. Beyond financial services, DBG is dedicated to delivering appropriate non-financial support to enhance the country’s business ecosystem while adhering to sustainable and global best practices.
Mr. Duker reaffirmed DBG’s dedication to supporting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), job creation, and promoting inclusive and sustainable development in Ghana. To achieve this, the bank plans to expand its network of participating financial institutions (PFIs) by identifying and onboarding new PFIs. DBG aims to have at least ten PFIs by the end of the year, with Sinapi Aba being the latest addition to the network alongside existing partners such as Ecobank, Absa, and Zenith Bank.
In April of this year, DBG made headlines when it announced a seed fund of US$70 million for its partial credit guarantee scheme. This scheme was designed to provide additional support for Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to manage risks associated with loan defaults. The initiative aims to encourage more investments in high-risk sectors of the economy, strengthening the PFIs’ ability to serve the SME sector while sharing the risk of investment with DBG.
“As we move forward, we will rely on the support of all our banking partners in our initiative to digitally transform financial services,” Mr. Duker emphasized, highlighting DBG’s commitment to innovation. “We seek your continued support as we aim to be a conduit for financial institutions to collaborate on innovations, such as common underwriting standards and co-creating robust alternative credit scoring models. These joint efforts will allow us to better serve the needs of businesses while also promoting prudent lending practices and risk management within our industry.”
DBG’s expansion into equity funding marks a significant milestone in the bank’s mission to drive economic growth, foster innovation, and support the transformation of Ghana’s private sector. With a clear vision and strategic initiatives, DBG is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Ghana’s financial landscape.",Benjamin Aklama,Bankg And Fance,"October 11, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/development-bank-ghana-set-to-diversify-financial-offerings-by-introducing-equity-fund-alongside-lending-activities/

Pharmaceutical Society charged to utilize AI to transform industry,"Ghanaian businessman and Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah is encouraging pharmacists across the country to leverage the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to better position the pharmaceutical industry for economic growth.
This, he explains can be achieved by deepening collaborations with other technological bodies to offer world class pharmaceutical output for consumers.
Speaking at the 2023 Annual General Conference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana (PSG) under the theme: Pharmacist for National Development, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah emphasized the critical role played by artificial intelligence in all sectors of the economy.



“Today, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and big data have revolutionized research and learning, driving production and service delivery in ways we have never seen before. In the wake of these developments, predictions are being made that some professions and skills groups risk being replaced in the job market,” he said.
“I encourage you to apply the new technologies to indigenous health and knowledge systems, build upon them and produce world-class pharmaceutical output from them. This will require collaboration with other bodies including state and non-state actors,” he urged.
Sir Sam Jonah also charged players within the pharmaceutical industry across Africa to accelerate efforts in turning the fortunes of the industry.
According to him, the insignificant share of the global pharma industry revenue leaves more room for African pharmacists to scale up policies and relevant mechanisms to change the narrative.
The pharmaceutical industry in Africa was valued at US$ 45 billion in fiscal year 2021 and is projected to reach $60 billion by the end of 2023.
With a population of over 1.4 billion currently representing about 17.89% of the global total, Africa accounts for only about 3% of the global pharmaceutical market.
He thus encouraged Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies in Ghana to see the brighter side of every challenge and proffer solutions that will transform the economy.
“Africa’s share of the global pharmaceutical market is comparatively negligible. Therein lies the opportunity for growth. So, what is holding you back?” he said.
“The entrepreneurial and risk-aggressive among you must move decisively to form partnerships with established foreign companies with the purpose of acquiring much needed technology and liquidity through foreign direct investment,” he added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Busess, Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/pharmaceutical-society-charged-to-utilize-ai-to-transform-industry/
Apple says iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the vision OS App Store from the get-go,"While Apple’s famed Vision Pro headset is not available for purchase, the company is making sure that users get plenty of apps to use when they finally get it. The company said today that iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the visionOS’ App Store on the launch day.


This means developers won’t have to do extra work to port their existing apps. Apple said that this fall, it will release a developer beta version of the visionOS including the App Store.
“By default, your iPad and/or iPhone apps will be published automatically on the App Store on Apple Vision Pro. Most frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in visionOS, which means nearly all iPad and iPhone apps can run on visionOS, unmodified. Customers will be able to use your apps on visionOS early next year when Apple Vision Pro becomes available,” the company said in a post.

Apple announced the Vision Pro headset at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. Later that month, the company released the Vision Pro SDK for developers to play around with different elements of the visionOS. In July, Apple started accepting applications for issuing a developer kit on loan. The company has also been hosting in-person developer labs for Vision Pro in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.
The Cupertino-based tech giant said that while iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the VisionOS App Store automatically, developers can use the SDK to add 3D elements and support for hand gestures to make the apps “feel more natural” on the device.
In a recent interview with Digital Trends, Steve Sinclair, senior director of product marketing for Apple Vision Pro said that the number of SDK downloads has “exceeded” the company’s expectations.
However, because of the limited location of developer labs for in-person experience and a constrained dev kit program, a lot of developers have to work with the simulator most of the time. Sinclair said that to have a vast array of apps providing different experiences, Apple will “need to make it [the Vision Pro] accessible to every single one of our developers.”

China launches $41 billion fund to accelerate semiconductor industry,"China is taking significant steps to bolster its semiconductor industry with the launch of a colossal $41 billion fund.
This initiative, announced by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, commonly known as the “Big Fund,” marks the largest of three funds introduced by the country.
It comes as the United States tightens restrictions on chip exports to China, adding to the ongoing global competition for dominance in the semiconductor sector.



The primary focus of this substantial fund will be directed toward investments in chip manufacturing equipment, according to reports.
The fund’s mission is to amass $41 billion in financial resources, a considerable effort given its scale. In comparison, the previous funds initiated by the Big Fund in 2014 and 2019 raised approximately $19 billion and $27 billion, respectively.
Semiconductors are essential materials such as silicon used in electronic circuits and play a pivotal role in a wide array of technological applications.
Their importance has surged notably with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the intensifying global race to establish supremacy in the semiconductor industry.
The United States had already begun imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, a move that garnered attention even before the AI boom.
In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce implemented updates to export controls, significantly limiting China’s ability to advance its semiconductor and supercomputing technologies.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s most valuable semiconductor firm, is situated in Taiwan but is currently constructing a $40 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona.
This strategic move is driven by concerns of potential interference from China, with some officials in the past even suggesting that the United States would rather dismantle Taiwan’s semiconductor facilities than permit Chinese control.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need for greater self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector. In March, Xi underscored the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the face of fierce international competition.
The establishment of this extensive state-backed fund serves as a formidable response to these challenges, furthering China’s pursuit of self-reliance in the semiconductor industry despite prevailing sanctions.",Benjamin Aklama,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/china-launches-41-billion-fund-to-accelerate-semiconductor-industry/

There could even be an establishment of a secretariat for machine learning and AI to really promote and encourage start-ups that are making technology in the field of AI and machine learning to really make Impact,” he said.
On her part, the Head of Computer Science and Information Systems Department at Ashesi University, Dr. Ayorkor Korsah allayed fears that AI will in the near future take over the jobs of the current workforce. She rather impressed on the working communities to acquire the necessary skill sets to meet the new dynamics associated with emerging society.
“As we are thinking about AI and getting closer to automation, we also need to think very carefully about the structure of our society, the opportunities and education that people have access to,” she explained.
“The jobs that tend to fall off are the manual jobs and the repetitive jobs: these are very easy to automate. If the only skill one has is that then yes, your job might be taken. We have to leverage on ready opportunities to be educated as someone who is actually creating these AI tools to get jobs in areas where skills and human asset plays a role,” she added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 5, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/govt-urged-to-commit-more-investments-to-enhance-ai-competencies/
Stakeholders in digital ecosystem charged to do more to protect child privacy,"Policy Makers in the digital ecosystem are being encouraged to deepen collaborations that safeguard the data of children across the country.
This, according to the Africa Digital Rights Hub, a not profit think and action tank agency will ensure that children optimize the usage of internet related platforms while being protected.
Teki Akuetteh is the Director of Africa Digital Rights Hub and she made these comments at the launch of the Young People, Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report here in Accra.



“We continue to see that we are not adequately protecting their data or their information when it comes to their online activities so this is essentially a clarion call to policy makers and agencies that are required to protect children and their online activities to do a lot more,” she urged.
Delivering the key note address, a retired Supreme Court judge, Prof. Justice Samuel Kofi Date-Bah, underscored the correlation between young people and technology in building the country. He thus charged policy makers to find solutions to the concerns of young people about their online privacy.
“The Digital world relentlessly collects and collates data about children who use their products but the data of these children must be protected in accordance with stipulated charters on the welfare of the child,” he said.
The Young People Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report surveyed over one hundred young people between ages 13 and 17 in Accra to discover what they think about privacy and trust in this digital context.

A look into how business in Nigeria has fared since President Tinubus election,"


The performance of the business ecosystem in Nigeria, in 2023 is a subject of keen interest, as it plays a pivotal role in the country’s economic development and prosperity.






Nigeria’s private sector, comprising of businesses ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to large corporations, has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but none more seemingly so than the country’s current foreign exchange rate.


On May 29, 2023, Bola Ahmed Tinubu was inaugurated as Nigeria’s new president and immediately got to work implementing some of the policies he had promised to enact. His economic initiatives began with the removal of the controversial fuel subsidies, which he announced would be removed immediately. Just then, fuel prices in the country went up from $0.26 to as high as $0.91 before flatlining to $0.80 (according to the Naira’s current exchange rate).


It goes without saying that the sharp increase in the cost of energy created an economic shock many Nigerians were not prepared for. Ultimately, inflation rose from 22.41% in May to 22.79% in June and now stands at an 18-year high of 25.8%.


The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), notes that this increase in the inflation rate is largely a result of the president’s economic reforms. “The August inflation figure rose for an eighth straight month from July’s 24.08%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), compounding a cost of living crisis worsened by Tinubu’s reforms,” the organization noted.


However, the removal of fuel subsidies is hardly the only work at play, as the president’s other major reform, the unification of the country’s currency rates, has devalued the Nigerian currency to its worst levels yet. Prior to the unification, Nigeria’s exchange rate against USD averaged 460.702 Naira (USD/NGN), it now averages 785.5 Naira per dollar, sometimes reaching as high as N1000.


With these complications in place, it is a wonder how the Nigerian private sector has fared, especially considering that the private sector plays a major role in generating revenue for the country. It is also important to note that the president has insisted that these two moves were the right decisions to make for Nigeria’s economic recovery.


Nigeria’s private sector


Nigeria’s private sector which cuts across financial services, manufacturing, telecoms, and consumer goods, in addition to the informal sector, and others has been a major contributor to Africa’s largest economy.


The top 35 of the companies comprising this sector, according to Nairametrics, a Nigerian business news publication, reported a combined N2.146 trillion in profits in 2023 so far against a total average of N12.1 trillion in shareholder funds. Additionally, the top ten of said companies accounted for 76% of the entire market with a joint value of N27.67 trillion. Eight of the ten companies are valued above N1 trillion.


This is a brief highlight of how much Nigeria’s private sector thrives. Some of the companies alluded to above include, GTCO, UBA, Zenith Bank, Okomu Oil, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement etc.


“Among the companies analyzed that recorded return on equity include, MTN Nigeria (+43.22%), Dangote Cement (+37.23%), Zenith Bank (+36.90%), Presco (+36.17%), Fidelity Bank (+34.90%), BUA Foods (+34.18%), FCMB (+33%), etc,” the report reads in part


According to Statista; “The domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP in Nigeria increased by 1.4 percentage points (+11.54 percent) in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In total, the share amounted to 13.56 percent in 2021.”


Business Performance in Nigeria Year In the Past Year



As the naira resumed regular circulation after two months of depreciation, business activity in Africa’s largest economy grew in April 2023, according to a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released in May 2023 the PMI stood at 54.0. However, the next month, the new president’s new reform began to take hold of Nigeria’s economy.



Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a survey-based economic indicator designed to provide a timely insight into business conditions. Business conditions are said to be improving when readings are above 50.0 and deteriorating when values are below 50.0.


In June, the PMI dipped slightly to 53.2, and in July, business activity in Nigeria hit its lowest in 4 months on rising prices with a PMI of 51.7. In August the PMI declined further to 50.2, and in September, the country’s PMI increased slightly to 51.1.



PMI after Tinubu’s election






However, it is interesting to note that there have been lower PMIs recorded in 2023, prior to April of the year. In March the headline PMI stood at 42.3 and 44.7 in February, both the lowest so far in the year, and both under the former administration. However, the two-month disappointing figures were preceded by better figures.


As of last year, September’s PMI stood at 53.7, the following month read 53.6, November figures were 54.3, and by the last month of the year, the country’s PMI stood at 54.6.


The first month of 2023 recorded 53.5 before declining in February and March and then picking back up in April.



Nigeria’s PMI before Tinubu






Despite the fact that an earlier report revealed that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s reforms have had some negative impact on the economic, the figures above demonstrate the since Tinubu took over, Nigeria’s PMI has not been alarming different from the months preceeding his inuguration.


This could be because the PMI is the sum average of over 400 businesses each able to mitigate loss to varying degrees, and as such, the impact and nuances on specific businesses and industries are not detailed.


A survey of 400 businesses in the sectors of manufacturing, services, construction, and retail led to the creation of the Index, which gauges how business in the country have been performing.


It is a composite index made up of five separate indices with the following weights: New Orders (30%), Output (25%), Employment (20%), Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%), and Stock of Items Purchased (10%), with the Delivery Times index inverted so that it moves in a similar manner.

The effect of the Israel-Gaza conflict and national census ripples across SAs economy,"The South African currency fell on Monday as the unrest in the Middle East fueled risk aversion in global markets, and traders anticipated the outcome of the national census, which is due this week.

At 1510 GMT, the rand was trading at 19.4100 per dollar, down 0.6% from its Friday close.


“Trade in the rand will likely remain cautious as markets wait to see how the Middle East situation develops,” TreasuryONE currency strategist Andre Cilliers said.


As reported by the American news agency, Reuters, the US dollar rose against a basket of global currencies as confrontations between Israeli troops and the Palestinian militant group Hamas increased, sending investors fleeing to the protection of the greenback.

“While South Africa is geographically far removed from the Israel/Gaza conflict, (it) is not deemed to have shown complete neutrality towards the Russian/Ukraine war and concerns exist that this may be repeated, which would undermine the rand further,” Investec economist Annabel Bishop said in a research note.


The results from South Africa’s 2022 census, the first in more than ten years and the fourth population and housing survey since apartheid, will be made public on Tuesday by the country’s statistics office.


It is anticipated to provide an in-depth examination of the economy that will boost planning and growth in the most developed economy in Africa.


The data will be the market’s main focus as it provides information on the South African economy and its battle with high unemployment.


The blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange maintained its position, finishing unchanged. The benchmark 2030 government bond for South Africa was less strong; its yield increased by 4 basis points to 10.93%.

West Africa records growth despite coups and underperformance of its largest economies,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic recovery is defined by certain subregions overperforming in comparison to the regional average and others underperforming.

The World Bank relayed the aforementioned information in its Africa’s Pulse bi-annual report. The global lender identified how Africa is doing based on regional performance, which supports its evaluation.


The report shows that while the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the largest economies in Africa such as Nigeria and South Africa have underperformed, regions like the East African Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) are performing better than the regional average in 2023.


The presence of large areas of high development and small areas of low growth that are correlated with economic and political stability (or lack thereof) serves as confirmation of the significant diversity in growth between countries in the region.

More than three-quarters of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa is generated by the ten largest economies, seven of which are expanding at rates that are below their long-term average growth. Sudan, Ghana, and Angola are three of the nations that will do worse in 2023 than they did from 2001-2019 in terms of growth rates.


Nevertheless, development is anticipated to pick up for the majority of nations as the projected annual average growth rate for 2024-25 is greater than that of 2023 for 39 of the region’s 47 countries.


The report also notes that the largest economy in West Africa, Nigeria, is expected to experience a decline in growth from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023.


Nigeria’s “oil production remains below the OPEC+ quota amid capacity issues and lower international oil prices. Non-oil economic activity—particularly industry and services—still supports growth, although policy actions to remove fuel subsidies and unify the exchange rates might be weighing on these activities in the short term,” the report reads in part.

World Bank projects Africas economy to slow down to 2.5%,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic outlook remains bleak amid an elusive growth recovery.
According to the latest World Bank Africa’s Pulse report, rising instability, weak growth in the region’s largest economies, and lingering uncertainty in the global economy are dragging down growth prospects in the region.
Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to decelerate to 2.5% in 2023, from 3.6% in 2022. South Africa’s GDP is expected to only grow by 0.5% in 2023 as energy and transportation bottlenecks continue to bite.



Nigeria and Angola are projected to grow at 2.9% and 1.3% respectively, due to lower international prices and currency pressures affecting oil and non-oil activity.
Increased conflict and violence in the region weigh on economic activity, and this rising fragility may be exacerbated by climatic shocks. In Sudan, economic activity is expected to contract by 12% because of the internal conflict which is halting production, destroying human capital, and crippling state capacity.
In per capita terms, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has not increased since 2015. In fact, the region is projected to contract at an annual average rate per capita of 0.1% over 2015-2025, thus potentially marking a lost decade of growth in the aftermath of the 2014-15 plunge in commodity prices.
“The region’s poorest and most vulnerable people continue to bear the economic brunt of this slowdown, as weak growth translates into slow poverty reduction and poor job growth,” said Andrew Dabalen, World Bank Chief Economist for Africa.
“With up to 12 million young Africans entering the labor market across the region each year, it has never been more urgent for policymakers to transform their economies and deliver growth to people through better jobs.”
Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a few bright spots. Inflation is expected to decline from 9.3% in 2022 to 7.3% in 2023 and fiscal balances are improving in African countries that are pursuing prudent and coordinated macroeconomic policies.
In 2023, the Eastern African community (EAC) is expected to grow by 4.9% while the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is set to grow by 5.1%. However, debt distress remains widespread with 21 countries at high risk of external debt distress or in debt distress as of June 2023.
Overall, current growth rates in the region are inadequate to create enough high-quality jobs to meet increases in the working-age population.
Current growth patterns generate only 3 million formal jobs annually, thus leaving many young people underemployed and engaged in casual, piecemeal, and unstable work that does not make full use of their skills.
Creating job opportunities for the youth will drive inclusive growth and turn the continent’s demographic wealth into an economic dividend.
“The urgency of the jobs challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored by the huge opportunity from demographic transitions that we have seen in other regions,” said Nicholas Woolley, World Bank Economist and contributor to the report.
“This will require an ecosystem that facilitates private-sector development and firm growth, as well as skill development that matches business demand.”
The development of labor-intensive manufacturing seems to be missing in Africa, limiting further effects for the indirect job creation in support services and international trade. This may be partly due to a lack of capital, which continues to hamper the structural transformation required for good quality jobs.
While the region contributes 12% of the global working age population, Sub-Saharan Africa owns only 2% of the global capital stock. This means people have fewer assets with which to be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other regions.
The report identifies a set of policies to overcome hurdles and unleash job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including:
Cost-effective private sector reforms, focused on increasing competition, uniform policy enforcement across firm sizes, and regulatory alignment with regional trading partners.
Governments can also help identify and support early-stage growth of businesses through more inclusive procurement practices and promotion of local businesses abroad.
Investment in education is necessary to boost semi-skilled occupations for the region. Interventions that improve learning in school are more effective than those increasing school attendance alone, while vocational education can be useful for addressing the underemployed and those who have missed out on education as children.
Education of girls and access to jobs for women can reduce potential productivity loss from the misallocation of female labor. Cash transfers have proven effective in increasing girls’ school enrollment and attendance, as well as in curbing pregnancies among school-age girls.

Billion dollar opioid addiction market fuels Nigerias drug crisis,"A growing market of addiction to synthetic opioids estimated at over $1 billion has been identified as the fastest-growing challenge in Nigeria’s drug crisis, apart from cocaine and heroin trafficking.
The emerging challenge is fuelled by the activities of organized crime syndicates that specialize in the production, use, and trafficking of drugs, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS).
With a total of 16 methamphetamine labs seized by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as of 2019, opioid production is aided by the importation of certain chemicals for the local pharmaceutical industry.



“The most important domestic drug market is that of synthetic opioids. The number of consumers is so large that the market is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion annually, likely marking Nigeria’s single highest-value drug market,” the report states.
Most opioid usage is reportedly connected to Tramadol, which comes in pill form. Although not illicit, the wide non-medical use in Nigeria is illegal.


Almost all the tramadol seized in Nigeria in containers between 2011 and 2019 was manufactured in South and Southeast Asia. Ports in Benin Republic and Togo, which often serve as conduits for goods destined for Nigeria, also seize large volumes of the drug.
Following the import and production ban of codeine cough syrup in Nigeria in 2018, it is likely that supplies are being diverted from neighboring countries, the report said.
Prices of tramadol in Nigeria rose five-fold between 2017 and 2021. Moreover, Nigeria remains a hub in the transnational cocaine and heroin trade, with cocaine coming from Latin America using Nigeria and neighboring countries as a transit hub also a matter of concern. Most cocaine couriered into Nigeria today comes from São Paolo (Brazil) through Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to Cotonou (Benin Republic) or Lagos (Nigeria).
While Nigeria has a system in place to limit the distribution of controlled medicines to licensed pharmacists, it appears to be widely disregarded. As one group of academics observed
Much of the cannabis produced is consumed locally, while most of the methamphetamine produced seems to be exported.
A prisoner interviewed by UNODC for the report explaining the details of his role as a recruiter of labour for a cannabis plantation said he recruited dozens of boys from his community who were transported by bus to work for a year on cannabis fields in another state.

The boys were paid N120,000 naira for one year’s work after their living costs had been deducted. Some of the boys used these funds to buy cannabis to sell in the city.
In this way, part of the distribution network proceeded organically from the cultivation operation.
One survey of communities in Bayelsa State found that “the typical cultivator was a wealthy or a rich man with a strong network and connections with government officials.”
One cultivator interviewed in prison by UNODC described a 50-member association of farmers with democratically elected officers to represent their common interests, including protection from law enforcement.
The chairman of this group was said to be a person of considerable social and financial influence.
The cultivator interviewed claimed to net N2 million (about $5,000) per year.
Citing the NDLEA, the report shows that cannabis sold for between N40,000 and N50,000 naira for a 50-kilogram bag in 2015 and N25,000 for a 25-kilogram bag in 2016.
Although there has been considerable seasonal variation, with dry season prices rising to N80, 000 per bag.
On the low end, this is about $100 for 50 kilograms, or one-fifth of one US cent per gram, suggesting a low-quality, low-investment bulk product.

The relatively cheap product can generate significant profits for the people who work in the market.
Distributors reported purchasing large volumes of cannabis and reselling them for two or three times the purchase price. One female prisoner, who bought from a source and sold to urban retailers, reported getting a loan for this purpose from a registered microfinance bank in Nigeria.

Nigeria aims for $5 billion tech investment by 2027,"Nigeria is setting its sights on attracting $5 billion in annual tech startup investments by 2027, unveiling a strategic plan to bolster the local tech ecosystem and foster innovation.
Dr. Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, announced this ambitious goal as part of the country’s broader plan to accelerate its digital economy.
In a report titled “Accelerating our Collective Prosperity through Technical Efficiency: A Strategic Plan for the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation & Digital Economy,” Dr. Tijani highlighted the pivotal role of innovation, entrepreneurship, and access to financing in the global tech landscape. He emphasized the ministry’s commitment to nurturing startups, particularly those pioneering groundbreaking solutions across key economic sectors, Business Insider Africa reported.



Acknowledging the importance of patient capital in startup growth, the minister stated that the ministry aims to boost the availability of such capital locally. The objective is to create an environment conducive to startups raising the necessary funds to thrive within Nigeria, ultimately encouraging more startups to establish themselves in the country.
To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, Dr. Tijani outlined a clear target: “Increase capital raised by Nigerian tech startups 50 percent year-on-year from ~$1 billion/yr in 2022 to $5 billion/yr in 2027.”
Furthermore, the ministry plans to establish an active sandbox environment to inspire and empower entrepreneurs and innovators to devise specialized solutions for industries that have had limited exposure to technological advancements.
Nigeria also aims to substantially boost the domiciliation of local tech startups, with a target of increasing it from less than 1 percent to 25 percent by 2027. This move is expected to enhance the startups’ contributions to the Nigerian economy significantly.
Dr. Tijani stressed the growing significance of digital transformation and innovation as drivers of economic progress. He underscored the unique opportunity presented by the intersection of a robust digital economy and Nigeria’s innovative and youthful population, envisioning a path toward prosperity, inclusivity, and global relevance.

Punitive domestic tariffs threaten African trade,"Tariff and non-tariff barriers in the country remain a real threat to the vision of a liberalised African trade market under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
This is despite the fact that Ghana’s legal framework supports free trade, says a study that revealed tariff barriers are imposed as taxes and duties on imports – while non-tariff barriers (NTBs) encompass protectionist policies against foreign trade.
Combined, it said, they threaten the idea of a free continental free trade market.



Under the AFCFTA’s mandate for gradually reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers, Ghana is expected to liberalise tariffs over ten years and remove non-tariff barriers.
“Removing these restrictions will significantly increase trade within African countries,” says the study dubbed— Situational analysis of Ghana’s AFCFTA preparedness: a review of the legal, policy and regulatory Framework for implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA in Ghana).
Produced by Ishmael Yamson & Associates and Sam Okudzeto & Associates on behalf of the University of Professional Studies-Accra (UPSA) Law School, the report underscores the necessity of addressing certain challenges within the domestic legal framework to enhance the AfCFTA’s implementation.
These challenges encompass the absence of harmonisation in laws, regulations and standards across the continent.
The report suggests the country should strive to align its laws with those of other African nations to facilitate the smooth movement of goods and services across borders.
Furthermore, it highlights that insufficient funding for policy implementation, coupled with a deficiency in the necessary skills for policy execution – along with issues such as transparency deficits, inconsistent and overlapping regulations and a centralised and costly bureaucratic system – pose significant challenges.
These challenges make enforcement difficult, and compliance confusing and costly; further impeding the country’s effective participation in the free trade area.
Ghana must excel in AfCFTA implementation
In response to the report, Dr. Fareed Arthur, Head-National AfCFTA Coordination Office, expressed gratitude to UPSA Law School and the authors for their extensive work.
He also mentioned that while he appreciates the report, there are certain points on which he holds differing opinions.
“Depending on where and what you are looking at, the issue of preparedness comes out differently. It [AfCFTA] is a new experiment. We are still negotiating parts of the World Trade Organisation protocols even after its existence for over 50 years. In these agreements, you can never be entirely prepared because it’s an ongoing and evolving process.  AfCFTA is not a one-time event that you prepare for and then simply sit,” said Dr. Arthur.
With that said, he believes the study’s findings will contribute to the government’s efforts in harnessing the benefits which AfCFTA bring, saying: “The narrative is that Ghana consistently perceives itself as a leading force in the political liberation of this continent. We believe that AfCFTA represents the economic frontier, and as such Ghana must excel in its implementation”.
AfCTA must never fail
The commencement of AfCFTA creates the world’s largest free trade area, encompassing the most countries in its reach.
This historic pact links 55 countries, uniting 1.3 billion people and boasting a collective gross domestic product (GDP) valued at US$ 3.4 trillion.
Moreover, it holds the promise of uplifting 30 million individuals from extreme poverty. However, realising its full potential hinges on the implementation of substantial policy reforms and the facilitation of trade.
Deputy Trade and Industry Minister, Michael Okyere Baafi – who launched the report, emphasised that the concept of free trade on the continent is not only a game-changer but also an opportunity for Africans to discover and leverage the potential of Africa to their advantage.
He also envisions this development as a means to transform the African continent into a place that is regarded as the best in the world by everyone.
“We are exploring Africa to see the opportunities available. So, let’s make sure that Africans take advantage of all the opportunities available in Africa. This is the way to make the continent rich and avoid travelling to the West for loans,” he said.
“So, we cannot fail. It’s important that as a country we strive to ensure this concept [AfCFTA] works, as host of the secretariat. It must never be allowed to fail,” he added.

"Ofori-Atta commends G20 for AUs inclusion, urges common voice","The Minister for Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta says Africa now has the opportunity to contribute to key global issues and push for common interests that would help accelerate economic development in the region.
Mr. Ofori-Atta’s optimism follows the recent inclusion of the African Union in the Group of 20 most important industrialized and developing economies, also known as the G20. It becomes the second regional bloc to join the group after the European Union.
‘There had been several decisions taken without Africa on the board and thank God the G20 agreed that Africa will have a seat so we will be part of the designing the solutions to our Global challenges,’’ the Finance Minister said.



He was speaking at a panel on the Energy Transition Accelerator organized by the Rockefeller Foundation on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly.
The minister added that the inclusion is long overdue, hoping that it will create a balance in global institutions.
The Group of 20
The G20 was formed as an informal group in 1999 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, providing a platform for finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 of the world’s largest and emerging economies. It later included heads of state and governments.
The group has since widened its scope beyond finance and economics, adding some of the world’s pressing challenges to its agenda. It includes health, climate change, food security, energy and sustainable development.
‘Our admission provides another opportunity to push for accelerated reforms in the global financial system to ensure developing nations are treated fairly,’ Mr Ofori-Atta said.
Until the admission of the African Union as a permanent member, the 19-member group jointly accounted for more than 80% of global productivity, 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world’s population.
Despite Africa joining the group with 3% of global economic output, the 55 member states come with a population of 1.3 billion people, largely in their youthful and productive stages of life.
The continent is aggressively pushing for inclusion at all international tables where decisions that affect its people are taken.
The Finance Minister said Africa will come with common positions on issues of international concern, especially the ones that affect the continent the most.
‘Africa will speak with one voice to ensure we make good use of our membership to help realize the aspirations of our people,’ Mr Ofori-Atta stated.",citibusinessnews,"Africa, Featured","September 21, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/ofori-atta-commends-g20-for-aus-inclusion-urges-common-voice/

"IMF: Ghana has fulfilled obligations, awaiting creditor action on debt restructuring","The Director of the African Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Abebe Aemro Selassie, has confirmed that Ghana has taken the required steps to secure the long-awaited financing assurance from its external creditors.
He added that the IMF is patiently awaiting responses from bilateral creditors.
“I have to tell you that whereas it took something like nine months or more for Zambia to get the official creditor committee to be created, in Ghana’s case, it was fairly rapid…Ghana has done its fair share and it’s for the creditors to take steps,” Mr. Selassie said when addressing journalists following the publication of Africa’s Regional Outlook Report during the Annual IMF/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco.



He added “We’re not going to be asking the government to do more adjustment because creditors haven’t asked either. We will provide all the information necessary, so creditors can move, allowing us to go to the Board as soon as possible.”
Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta earlier disclosed that Ghana had secured assurances from both China and France regarding the Memorandum of Outstanding (MoU) for the restructuring of the country’s external bilateral debts.
“We have met the Central Bank Governor of China and we don’t perceive any opposition or reluctance in participating positively when it comes to the Memorandum of Understanding on restructuring of our external bilateral debts” the finance minister said.
Responding to inquiries from journalists at the Annual International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, Morocco, Mr Ofori-Atta added, “The Chinese government within the past months is close to reaching a similar deal with Zambia, Sri Lanka and Suriname, so following that trend, we expect some similar cooperation from them when it comes to Ghana”.
Mr Ofori-Atta in an earlier interview described the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings as an opportunity for a new beginning for the global financial architecture.
In his remarks at a Roundtable Discussion on “IMF Policy Priorities,” Mr Ofori-Atta charged the IMF to strengthen the global financial safety net through bold reforms to the global financial architecture.
During the Roundtable hosted by US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, Mr Ofori-Atta praised the transformative leadership of IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, which has led to the achievement of truly momentous things.
He however continued, “We need to stretch the IMF to do more. The need is great. And at these Annual Meetings, the developing world is asking the international community to do all it can to advance a reform agenda that ensures institutions like the IMF have the requisite mandates, financing, and governance models to deliver transformative impact.”",citibusinessnews,"Featured, Local Economy","October 16, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-ghana-has-fulfilled-obligations-awaiting-creditor-action-on-debt-restructuring/
"IMF, World Bank work to accelerate debt treatment for Ghana, others under G20","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank are working together to accelerate debt restructuring for Ghana and other countries under the Group of Twenty (G20) Common Framework.
Ms Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF said this during a plenary meeting at the 2023 IMF/WGB Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“The IMF and the World Bank are bringing all relevant creditors and debtors together with promising signs,” the IMF Managing Director said.



She explained that the two global financial institutions were doing so because the progress of the Common Framework on delivering on debt restructurings had been slow. The move is one of the supporting-pillars of the two-thronged “no regrets” actions for the next fifty years, captured in the Marrakech Principles, aimed at closing the divergent global income gap and generate job-rich growth for all.
The two policy actions are – investment in strong economic foundations, and investment in global cooperation.
More than half of low-income countries remained in or were at risk of debt distress, with about half of emerging economies facing default-like debt spreads. That, Ms Georgieva, said required prompt delivery of debt treatment, which would be beneficial to both creditors and debtors.
On the Fund’s support beyond pushing for speedy debt negotiations, she said, about US$1 trillion in liquidity and financing had been provided to countries across the world since the
“This came via the US$650bn Special Drawing Right (SDR) and US$320bn in lending to 96 countries, including 56 low-income nations,” she said.
“Our meetings here in Marrakech, the Red, leave me in no doubt that, together, we will unlock the door to opportunities for the next generation,” the IMF Managing Director said.
“Debt has increased throughout emerging markets – doubling in Africa – shackling
countries to the ground just as they’re trying to rise, Mr Banga, the World Bank President
noted.
He said it had become important to reimagine partnerships and have innovative plans to address the debt and other economic and climate change challenges for a liveable planet.
“We took our first steps on this journey in April, squeezing US$40bn over 10 years from our balance sheet by adjusting our loan to equity ratio,” the World Bank President said.
He added that the Bank had also created a portfolio guarantee mechanism, together with the launch of a hybrid capital instrument to enable it take risks and boost its lending capacity, the more.
“Taken together, we could provide US$157bn more in lending over a decade,” Mr Banga
said.
Immediate steps were taken to lessen the debt burden of low-income countries after the COVID-19 pandemic, where countries called on the IMF and World Bank to lend their support to the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).
This was after a decision by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting to endorse the suspension of debt service of most vulnerable countries of under the Group.
Further action was taken later on in 2020 by the G20 Finance Ministers in endorsing the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI to facilitate the timely and orderly debt treatment for DSSI-eligible countries.
Since then, Ghana, Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia have requested for debt restructuring, and
are at various stages of deals with Official Creditors.
Ghana, for example, looks forward to signing a pact with external creditors for a second tranche of US$600m from IMF, Zambia reached an agreement on Saturday, October 14, 2023, and awaiting official signing of agreement.

Zambia advises Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation,"Mr Situmbeko Musokotwane, Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zambia, has advised Ghana to have restrictive laws on debt accumulation.
“We put a law in Parliament which tied my hands to say, going forward, you can’t be like those in the past. So, we tied our hands for Parliament to have more power and restrictions on borrowing,” he said.
That should be combined with reforms to maintain credibility with creditors, international community, and citizens, as well as create a conducive environment for private sector investment for value addition.



He expressed confidence that such action would hasten the processes of concluding debt treatment, grow the
economy, increase domestic revenue, create more jobs and uplift the living standards of people, and help avoid future debt crisis.
Minister Musokotwane said this as he shared the experience of Zambian authorities, who on Saturday, October 14, 2023, formalised on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with its Official Creditors on restructuring of some US$6.3 billion debt.
Zambia, the first African country to default on its debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, reached an agreement in
principle in June, and currently awaiting to sign an MoU for the restructuring of its debt.
He spoke at the African Finance Ministers press briefing on Saturday, October 14, 2023, in Marrakech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG) Annual Meetings.
He explained that it was important for the country to take prudent measures not to accumulate high debts by having strong structural and sustainable reforms, while investing in education, healthcare, infrastructure and industrialisation.
“To get the support of the international community – lenders and other people, obviously, must conclude that you’re worthy of their support, and willing to take steps to assist yourself,” he noted.
“We’ve learnt a lot, and for people like you [Ghana], you’ve been lucky,” Mr Musokotwane said, with respect to Ghana gaining external creditors assurance and securing an IMF programme in five months.
Among others, Ghana has a Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2018 (Act 982), which requires government not to spend beyond a threshold that would push fiscal deficit above five per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
However, it was suspended in 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the government envisaged that it would not meet the five per cent deficit threshold.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Finance and B Bank of Ghana (BoG) have signed an MoU, providing for zero monetary financing throughout the IMF US$3 billion loan-support programme with Ghana.
Meanwhile, Ghana’s economic growth had averaged 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters of 2023, something that Dr. Ernest Addison, Governor, BoG, explained, should make government “operate without access to central bank financing.”

"2024 budget: Government commits to more expenditure cuts, aggressive growth, jobs","The government has assured Ghanaians that it will safeguard current economic gains, and make it reflect in the living conditions of everyone in the coming months.
To this end, there would be more expenditure reduction measures in the 2024 budget, as well as policies to consolidate macroeconomic gains, ensuring that inflation and exchange rate are tamed.
Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Finance Minister and Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, Information Minister, gave the
assurances on Friday evening ahead of the budget presentation in November.



They spoke on the sidelines of the 2023 International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Group (WBG)
Annual Meetings in Marrakech.
“You’ll see more prudent fiscal measures in the 2024 budget to keep the macroeconomy stable so that inflation continues to go down and the currency remains stable. That’s an assurance from government that will surely happen” Mr Ofori-Atta said.
“We’ll also find various incentives and resources into the growth agenda that we have to catalyse the
private sector to thrive,” the Minister pledged during a press briefing.
The government introduced a number of cost-cutting measures in the 2023 budget, including, a freeze on
employment in the public sector, reduction in salaries of some government officials, aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability.
In an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Nkrumah said those measures had started yielding
positive results, but the government would do more, which would be specified in the 2024 budget.
“Although we don’t have the final figures, one of the clearest ways to examine the performance of the measures to reduce expenditure is to look at the primary balance, and there’s a clear indication that we’re doing well to stay within the revenue envelope that we have,” he said.
Ghana’s primary balance – the difference between the amount of revenue the government collects and
spends on providing public goods and services, excluding debt payment, was −1.3 as of the first half of
2022, but stood at 0.6 the same period, 2023.
Reiterating government’s commitment to fiscal discipline, Mr Nkrumah said: “Going forward, our focus is
to stay on that path to ensure that we don’t blow the fiscals out of gear.”
Some Civil Society Groups, Economists and Governance experts in the country have been calling for a
reduction in the number of ministers and government officials as part of measure to maintain fiscal
discipline, but that is yet to happen.
They have also encouraged the government to be more aggressive on collecting property taxes, incentivize to rope the informal sector into the tax net, and reduce the rate of the Electronic Transactions Levy (E-levy) to about 0.5 per cent from the one per cent.
That they expressed confidence in increasing domestic revenue to support expenditure reduction measures, making the economy more robust.

With a relentless commitment to serving its customers better, the Bank has consistently led the way in redefining banking in Ghana through innovative solutions. One significant milestone in Zenith’s innovation journey was its pioneering venture into online banking, revolutionizing the way customers managed their finances.

The Bank continues to deepen its engagement with customers and its accessibility to them through initiatives such as its 24hour Customer Contact Centre, Zenith Direct, which features channels such as Z-Chat (an online live chat platform), the Complaints Portal, Voice Calls, and Email – where customers can seek information about products and services, provide service feedback to the Bank, or report complaints. The Bank’s unwavering commitment to a customer-centric approach, characterized by open communication and support for clients during difficult times has fostered trust and loyalty.

In commemoration of the 18th Anniversary celebration, Zenith Bank Ghana organised a prayer and thanksgiving service to thank the Almighty God for 18 successful years of Banking operations in Ghana.

A key highlight of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary celebration was the Bank’s presentation of a cheque of GHS150,000 to the Pediatric Oncology Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).  The presentation, which was in furtherance of the Bank’s CSR objective of giving back to the society in which it operates was in response to an appeal by Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG), a non-governmental organization dedicated to making childhood cancer a national health priority whilst facilitating and increasing access to optimal medical care and treatment for children with cancer.
Speaking at the presentation, the MD/CEO stated that, “When Akua Sarpong, the Co-founder and Executive Directive of Lifeline for Childhood Cancer Ghana (LCCG) spoke with our colleagues about the cause she is championing, we saw that it is one that needed some form of assistance especially from corporate institutions, and we readily and willingly supported this very worthy cause as September is Childhood Cancer Awareness month globally as well as the month of the Bank’s 18th Anniversary”.
Speaking on behalf of LCCG and the Oncology Unit, Prof. Lorna Reinner, Pediatric Oncologist at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital who spoke on behalf of the Pediatric Oncology Unit expressed appreciation to Zenith Bank for the very kind gesture. She indicated that the LCCG and the hospital are currently working towards the expansion of the pediatric oncology block to increase the current facility’s capacity to include a 40-bed children’s ward to enable the hospital improve treatment and care for patients; as such the Bank’s donation which was apt and timely and would go towards the construction of the new ward.
Prof. Reinner thus noted that increased support from other corporate institutions would greatly help the unit improve treatment outcomes for children with cancer and their families given the needed support.
Prior to the presentation at the Pediatric Oncology Units, earlier in the week, the Bank organised a Virtual Health Talk for staff on “Childhood Cancer –to create awareness of Childhood cancer and to educate staff on the signs, symptoms, preventive measures and treatment options available for patients.

For every customer that signed up for a product, they received an instant gift from the Bank to the delight of many.
The Bank’s online audience was not left out of the celebration as followers of the Bank’s social media pages also enjoyed fun and interactive games and rewards that kept them glued to the pages.
To climax the celebration, the Bank organised a TGIF/Karaoke Night across all branches to appreciate staff for their hard work, loyalty and commitment to the success of the Bank.

This follows his failure to pay in full an amount of GH¢90 million he agreed to pay the state despite several lifelines given him since December 2022.
Ato Essien pleaded guilty to 16 counts of stealing, money laundering and conspiracy to steal for his role in the collapse of Capital Bank.



He however entered a plea bargain with the state under section 35(7) of the courts ACT 459.
Under the agreement, Mr. Essien was expected to pay GH¢90 million for which he paid GH¢30 million cedis on December 13.
He was to pay the GH¢60 million remainder in three equal instalments in 2023; GH¢20 million by April 28, another GH¢20 million by August 31 and the last GH¢20 million by December 15, 2023.
A major condition of the agreement was that the court would not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence if he missed any of the payment deadlines.
But as of April 28, Mr. Essien had not paid all the GH¢20 million due to be settled.
The state filed an application on May 2, 2023, to get a custodial sentence imposed on the convict (Ato Essien).
But that application was not heard as the presiding judge, Justice Eric Kyei Baffour gave him (Ato Essien) about six months to redeem himself.
But between January this year to October 12, Ato Essien has only paid GH¢7 million in addition to the GH¢30 million previously paid.
With GH¢53 million of the agreed sum outstanding, the judge having exhausted his patience allowed the state to move the application.
The judge upon hearing the application jailed Ato Essien to spend 15 years in prison.",citibusinessnews,"Bankg And Fance, Featured","October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/former-capital-bank-ceo-ato-essien-jailed-15-years/
IMF clarifies Ghanas growth rate projection,"The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Resident Representative in Ghana, Dr. Leandro Medina, has clarified that the growth rate for the country has not been revised to 1.2% from the May 2023 forecast of 1.5%.
Dr. Medina explained that the latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection of 1.2% growth for 2023 is based on an old set of projections that do not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2% for the first two quarters).
He added that based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, the IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5% previously assumed.



Various media portals reported that the IMF had lowered Ghana’s growth rate to 1.2% making it the second time the Fund had revised Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for 2023.
But Dr Medina in a statement clarifying the issue said “The latest IMF World Economic Outlook projection (1.2 per cent growth for 2023) is based on an old vintage of Fund staff projections. In particular, it does not take into account the recent data releases that showed a higher growth rate than expected at the beginning of the program (averaging 3.2 per cent for the first two quarters).
“At the current juncture, and based on the findings of the first ECF review mission that just ended last week, IMF staff assessment is that the growth projection for 2023 will be revised up from the 1.5 percent previously assumed.”

Stéphane Roudet, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Mission Chief to Ghana in an interview on the Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, October 9 also lauded Ghana’s economic growth.
Mr Roudet intimated that Ghana’s quick economic recovery is surprising and also encouraging, as the country has outperformed the IMF’s projection for the year 2023.
He indicated that the IMF had projected Ghana’s economy to grow at a rate of 1.5 percent by the year ending 2023, but the first-half report shows that the country’s economy is growing at a rate of 3 percent, which he said is very encouraging and will go a long way to ensuring the smooth disbursement of the second tranche of the $3 billion credit facility from the Fund.
“Ghana’s economic activities I have to say, have surprised us on the outside. You will remember that in the programme, we were projecting economic growth of 1.5 percent for this year, and now we have the outcome for the first half of the year, and we are about 3 percent and so you can see that there are signs that are encouraging.”",citibusinessnews,Busess,"October 12, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/imf-clarifies-ghanas-growth-rate-projection/

IMF awaits Ghanas agreement with bilateral creditors before releasing next tranche of $3bn bailout,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it is waiting for the outcome of Ghana’s engagement with its bilateral creditors before releasing the next tranche of the $3 billion bailout package.
This was disclosed by the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, in a tweet on Wednesday after meeting Ghanaian officials to discuss the way forward.
Ghana recently reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF following a review of the country’s economic progress after the first tranche of $600 million was disbursed.



Georgieva congratulated Ghana on securing the staff-level agreement.
In a tweet, she said “Great to meet @MoF_Ghana Min Ofori-Atta & @thebankofghana Gov Addison at #IMFMeetings. Congrats on the recent staff-level agreement on the Fund-supported program’s first review. Counting on bilateral creditors reaching agreement on debt relief soon to move the review forward.”
The IMF and Ghana reached a staff-level agreement on October 6 on economic policies and reforms to conclude the first review of the country’s three-year program under the Extended Credit Facility.
This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board and receipt of the necessary financing assurances.
The IMF has praised Ghana’s strong policy and reform commitment under the program, which it says is bearing fruit and leading to signs of economic stabilization.
In a report, the IMF noted that growth in 2023 has proven more resilient than initially envisaged, inflation has declined, the fiscal and external positions have improved, and the exchange rate has stabilized.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has appealed to its bilateral creditors to quickly agree on current debt relief terms to enable Ghana to secure the second tranche of the package from the IMF.

Development Bank Ghana set to diversify financial offerings by introducing equity fund alongside lending activities.,"DBG’s Chief Executive Officer, K. Duker, unveiled the bank’s plans for this equity fund, aimed at expanding the range of financial products available to both institutions and borrowers at different stages of development.
DBG, established in June 2022, has already disbursed GH¢731 million across various sectors, contributing to Ghana’s economic growth and development. Mr. Duker shared the bank’s vision for the future, stating, “Our vision is clear, and our processes are streamlined. With our enhanced lending system, we’ve become more efficient, enabling faster disbursements to our partners. By the end of 2023, we aim to have disbursed an impressive GH¢1 billion.”
“We’re in the final stages of launching an equity fund. Initially, it will be relatively small, but when your only tool is lending, everything seems like a loan, which isn’t always the case. So, we need to offer other products,” emphasized Mr. Duker.



“We are currently in the final stages of regulatory approval to establish an equity fund, which will provide us with more patient capital. This will allow us to offer equity, loans, and other products to the market, creating a virtuous circle of diverse products suitable for different stages of an institution’s or borrower’s journey.”
DBG’s focus extends beyond becoming the largest lender in Ghana, emphasizing its commitment to transforming the private sector. Mr. Duker added, “If I become the largest lender without transforming the private sector, I would have failed.”
Established by the government, DBG serves as a Development Finance Institution with the primary goal of facilitating and strengthening long-term financing for Ghanaian businesses. Beyond financial services, DBG is dedicated to delivering appropriate non-financial support to enhance the country’s business ecosystem while adhering to sustainable and global best practices.
Mr. Duker reaffirmed DBG’s dedication to supporting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), job creation, and promoting inclusive and sustainable development in Ghana. To achieve this, the bank plans to expand its network of participating financial institutions (PFIs) by identifying and onboarding new PFIs. DBG aims to have at least ten PFIs by the end of the year, with Sinapi Aba being the latest addition to the network alongside existing partners such as Ecobank, Absa, and Zenith Bank.
In April of this year, DBG made headlines when it announced a seed fund of US$70 million for its partial credit guarantee scheme. This scheme was designed to provide additional support for Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) to manage risks associated with loan defaults. The initiative aims to encourage more investments in high-risk sectors of the economy, strengthening the PFIs’ ability to serve the SME sector while sharing the risk of investment with DBG.
“As we move forward, we will rely on the support of all our banking partners in our initiative to digitally transform financial services,” Mr. Duker emphasized, highlighting DBG’s commitment to innovation. “We seek your continued support as we aim to be a conduit for financial institutions to collaborate on innovations, such as common underwriting standards and co-creating robust alternative credit scoring models. These joint efforts will allow us to better serve the needs of businesses while also promoting prudent lending practices and risk management within our industry.”
DBG’s expansion into equity funding marks a significant milestone in the bank’s mission to drive economic growth, foster innovation, and support the transformation of Ghana’s private sector. With a clear vision and strategic initiatives, DBG is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Ghana’s financial landscape.",Benjamin Aklama,Bankg And Fance,"October 11, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/10/development-bank-ghana-set-to-diversify-financial-offerings-by-introducing-equity-fund-alongside-lending-activities/

Pharmaceutical Society charged to utilize AI to transform industry,"Ghanaian businessman and Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah is encouraging pharmacists across the country to leverage the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to better position the pharmaceutical industry for economic growth.
This, he explains can be achieved by deepening collaborations with other technological bodies to offer world class pharmaceutical output for consumers.
Speaking at the 2023 Annual General Conference of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana (PSG) under the theme: Pharmacist for National Development, Sir Samuel Esson Jonah emphasized the critical role played by artificial intelligence in all sectors of the economy.



“Today, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and big data have revolutionized research and learning, driving production and service delivery in ways we have never seen before. In the wake of these developments, predictions are being made that some professions and skills groups risk being replaced in the job market,” he said.
“I encourage you to apply the new technologies to indigenous health and knowledge systems, build upon them and produce world-class pharmaceutical output from them. This will require collaboration with other bodies including state and non-state actors,” he urged.
Sir Sam Jonah also charged players within the pharmaceutical industry across Africa to accelerate efforts in turning the fortunes of the industry.
According to him, the insignificant share of the global pharma industry revenue leaves more room for African pharmacists to scale up policies and relevant mechanisms to change the narrative.
The pharmaceutical industry in Africa was valued at US$ 45 billion in fiscal year 2021 and is projected to reach $60 billion by the end of 2023.
With a population of over 1.4 billion currently representing about 17.89% of the global total, Africa accounts for only about 3% of the global pharmaceutical market.
He thus encouraged Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Companies in Ghana to see the brighter side of every challenge and proffer solutions that will transform the economy.
“Africa’s share of the global pharmaceutical market is comparatively negligible. Therein lies the opportunity for growth. So, what is holding you back?” he said.
“The entrepreneurial and risk-aggressive among you must move decisively to form partnerships with established foreign companies with the purpose of acquiring much needed technology and liquidity through foreign direct investment,” he added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Busess, Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/pharmaceutical-society-charged-to-utilize-ai-to-transform-industry/
Apple says iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the vision OS App Store from the get-go,"While Apple’s famed Vision Pro headset is not available for purchase, the company is making sure that users get plenty of apps to use when they finally get it. The company said today that iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the visionOS’ App Store on the launch day.


This means developers won’t have to do extra work to port their existing apps. Apple said that this fall, it will release a developer beta version of the visionOS including the App Store.
“By default, your iPad and/or iPhone apps will be published automatically on the App Store on Apple Vision Pro. Most frameworks available in iPadOS and iOS are also included in visionOS, which means nearly all iPad and iPhone apps can run on visionOS, unmodified. Customers will be able to use your apps on visionOS early next year when Apple Vision Pro becomes available,” the company said in a post.

Apple announced the Vision Pro headset at the Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in June. Later that month, the company released the Vision Pro SDK for developers to play around with different elements of the visionOS. In July, Apple started accepting applications for issuing a developer kit on loan. The company has also been hosting in-person developer labs for Vision Pro in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo.
The Cupertino-based tech giant said that while iPhone and iPad apps will show up on the VisionOS App Store automatically, developers can use the SDK to add 3D elements and support for hand gestures to make the apps “feel more natural” on the device.
In a recent interview with Digital Trends, Steve Sinclair, senior director of product marketing for Apple Vision Pro said that the number of SDK downloads has “exceeded” the company’s expectations.
However, because of the limited location of developer labs for in-person experience and a constrained dev kit program, a lot of developers have to work with the simulator most of the time. Sinclair said that to have a vast array of apps providing different experiences, Apple will “need to make it [the Vision Pro] accessible to every single one of our developers.”

China launches $41 billion fund to accelerate semiconductor industry,"China is taking significant steps to bolster its semiconductor industry with the launch of a colossal $41 billion fund.
This initiative, announced by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, commonly known as the “Big Fund,” marks the largest of three funds introduced by the country.
It comes as the United States tightens restrictions on chip exports to China, adding to the ongoing global competition for dominance in the semiconductor sector.



The primary focus of this substantial fund will be directed toward investments in chip manufacturing equipment, according to reports.
The fund’s mission is to amass $41 billion in financial resources, a considerable effort given its scale. In comparison, the previous funds initiated by the Big Fund in 2014 and 2019 raised approximately $19 billion and $27 billion, respectively.
Semiconductors are essential materials such as silicon used in electronic circuits and play a pivotal role in a wide array of technological applications.
Their importance has surged notably with the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the intensifying global race to establish supremacy in the semiconductor industry.
The United States had already begun imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, a move that garnered attention even before the AI boom.
In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce implemented updates to export controls, significantly limiting China’s ability to advance its semiconductor and supercomputing technologies.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s most valuable semiconductor firm, is situated in Taiwan but is currently constructing a $40 billion factory in Phoenix, Arizona.
This strategic move is driven by concerns of potential interference from China, with some officials in the past even suggesting that the United States would rather dismantle Taiwan’s semiconductor facilities than permit Chinese control.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the need for greater self-sufficiency in the semiconductor sector. In March, Xi underscored the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the face of fierce international competition.
The establishment of this extensive state-backed fund serves as a formidable response to these challenges, furthering China’s pursuit of self-reliance in the semiconductor industry despite prevailing sanctions.",Benjamin Aklama,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 6, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/china-launches-41-billion-fund-to-accelerate-semiconductor-industry/

Govt. urged to commit more investments to enhance AI competencies,"Government has been encouraged to commit more investment towards building the competencies of the student population in using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help transform the country in the technological space.
This, according to Deep Learning Indaba, a non-profit organization will strengthen machine learning and promote African innovators towards economic resilience.
Delali Agbenyegah is one of the General Chairs of Deep Learning and he spoke on the sidelines of the INDABA X conference here in Accra.



“We need investment, so the government must actually invest in the field of AI and machine learning. There could even be an establishment of a secretariat for machine learning and AI to really promote and encourage start-ups that are making technology in the field of AI and machine learning to really make Impact,” he said.
On her part, the Head of Computer Science and Information Systems Department at Ashesi University, Dr. Ayorkor Korsah allayed fears that AI will in the near future take over the jobs of the current workforce. She rather impressed on the working communities to acquire the necessary skill sets to meet the new dynamics associated with emerging society.
“As we are thinking about AI and getting closer to automation, we also need to think very carefully about the structure of our society, the opportunities and education that people have access to,” she explained.
“The jobs that tend to fall off are the manual jobs and the repetitive jobs: these are very easy to automate. If the only skill one has is that then yes, your job might be taken. We have to leverage on ready opportunities to be educated as someone who is actually creating these AI tools to get jobs in areas where skills and human asset plays a role,” she added.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, TECHNOLOGY","September 5, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/govt-urged-to-commit-more-investments-to-enhance-ai-competencies/
Stakeholders in digital ecosystem charged to do more to protect child privacy,"Policy Makers in the digital ecosystem are being encouraged to deepen collaborations that safeguard the data of children across the country.
This, according to the Africa Digital Rights Hub, a not profit think and action tank agency will ensure that children optimize the usage of internet related platforms while being protected.
Teki Akuetteh is the Director of Africa Digital Rights Hub and she made these comments at the launch of the Young People, Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report here in Accra.



“We continue to see that we are not adequately protecting their data or their information when it comes to their online activities so this is essentially a clarion call to policy makers and agencies that are required to protect children and their online activities to do a lot more,” she urged.
Delivering the key note address, a retired Supreme Court judge, Prof. Justice Samuel Kofi Date-Bah, underscored the correlation between young people and technology in building the country. He thus charged policy makers to find solutions to the concerns of young people about their online privacy.
“The Digital world relentlessly collects and collates data about children who use their products but the data of these children must be protected in accordance with stipulated charters on the welfare of the child,” he said.
The Young People Privacy and Trust in Ghana Report surveyed over one hundred young people between ages 13 and 17 in Accra to discover what they think about privacy and trust in this digital context.
The report proffers eight pointer recommendations to safeguard the privacy of children by children including providing young users with more control or ownership of their data.",Emmanuel Oppong,"Featured, General, TECHNOLOGY","August 29, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/08/stakeholders-in-digital-ecosystem-charged-to-do-more-to-protect-child-privacy/
A look into how business in Nigeria has fared since President Tinubus election,"


The performance of the business ecosystem in Nigeria, in 2023 is a subject of keen interest, as it plays a pivotal role in the country’s economic development and prosperity.






Nigeria’s private sector, comprising of businesses ranging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to large corporations, has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but none more seemingly so than the country’s current foreign exchange rate.


On May 29, 2023, Bola Ahmed Tinubu was inaugurated as Nigeria’s new president and immediately got to work implementing some of the policies he had promised to enact. His economic initiatives began with the removal of the controversial fuel subsidies, which he announced would be removed immediately. Just then, fuel prices in the country went up from $0.26 to as high as $0.91 before flatlining to $0.80 (according to the Naira’s current exchange rate).


It goes without saying that the sharp increase in the cost of energy created an economic shock many Nigerians were not prepared for. Ultimately, inflation rose from 22.41% in May to 22.79% in June and now stands at an 18-year high of 25.8%.


The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), notes that this increase in the inflation rate is largely a result of the president’s economic reforms. “The August inflation figure rose for an eighth straight month from July’s 24.08%, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), compounding a cost of living crisis worsened by Tinubu’s reforms,” the organization noted.


However, the removal of fuel subsidies is hardly the only work at play, as the president’s other major reform, the unification of the country’s currency rates, has devalued the Nigerian currency to its worst levels yet. Prior to the unification, Nigeria’s exchange rate against USD averaged 460.702 Naira (USD/NGN), it now averages 785.5 Naira per dollar, sometimes reaching as high as N1000.


With these complications in place, it is a wonder how the Nigerian private sector has fared, especially considering that the private sector plays a major role in generating revenue for the country. It is also important to note that the president has insisted that these two moves were the right decisions to make for Nigeria’s economic recovery.


Nigeria’s private sector


Nigeria’s private sector which cuts across financial services, manufacturing, telecoms, and consumer goods, in addition to the informal sector, and others has been a major contributor to Africa’s largest economy.


The top 35 of the companies comprising this sector, according to Nairametrics, a Nigerian business news publication, reported a combined N2.146 trillion in profits in 2023 so far against a total average of N12.1 trillion in shareholder funds. Additionally, the top ten of said companies accounted for 76% of the entire market with a joint value of N27.67 trillion. Eight of the ten companies are valued above N1 trillion.


This is a brief highlight of how much Nigeria’s private sector thrives. Some of the companies alluded to above include, GTCO, UBA, Zenith Bank, Okomu Oil, MTN Nigeria, Dangote Cement etc.


“Among the companies analyzed that recorded return on equity include, MTN Nigeria (+43.22%), Dangote Cement (+37.23%), Zenith Bank (+36.90%), Presco (+36.17%), Fidelity Bank (+34.90%), BUA Foods (+34.18%), FCMB (+33%), etc,” the report reads in part


According to Statista; “The domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP in Nigeria increased by 1.4 percentage points (+11.54 percent) in 2021 in comparison to the previous year. In total, the share amounted to 13.56 percent in 2021.”


Business Performance in Nigeria Year In the Past Year



As the naira resumed regular circulation after two months of depreciation, business activity in Africa’s largest economy grew in April 2023, according to a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released in May 2023 the PMI stood at 54.0. However, the next month, the new president’s new reform began to take hold of Nigeria’s economy.



Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is a survey-based economic indicator designed to provide a timely insight into business conditions. Business conditions are said to be improving when readings are above 50.0 and deteriorating when values are below 50.0.


In June, the PMI dipped slightly to 53.2, and in July, business activity in Nigeria hit its lowest in 4 months on rising prices with a PMI of 51.7. In August the PMI declined further to 50.2, and in September, the country’s PMI increased slightly to 51.1.



PMI after Tinubu’s election






However, it is interesting to note that there have been lower PMIs recorded in 2023, prior to April of the year. In March the headline PMI stood at 42.3 and 44.7 in February, both the lowest so far in the year, and both under the former administration. However, the two-month disappointing figures were preceded by better figures.


As of last year, September’s PMI stood at 53.7, the following month read 53.6, November figures were 54.3, and by the last month of the year, the country’s PMI stood at 54.6.


The first month of 2023 recorded 53.5 before declining in February and March and then picking back up in April.



Nigeria’s PMI before Tinubu






Despite the fact that an earlier report revealed that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s reforms have had some negative impact on the economic, the figures above demonstrate the since Tinubu took over, Nigeria’s PMI has not been alarming different from the months preceeding his inuguration.


This could be because the PMI is the sum average of over 400 businesses each able to mitigate loss to varying degrees, and as such, the impact and nuances on specific businesses and industries are not detailed.


A survey of 400 businesses in the sectors of manufacturing, services, construction, and retail led to the creation of the Index, which gauges how business in the country have been performing.


It is a composite index made up of five separate indices with the following weights: New Orders (30%), Output (25%), Employment (20%), Suppliers’ Delivery Times (15%), and Stock of Items Purchased (10%), with the Delivery Times index inverted so that it moves in a similar manner.

The effect of the Israel-Gaza conflict and national census ripples across SAs economy,"The South African currency fell on Monday as the unrest in the Middle East fueled risk aversion in global markets, and traders anticipated the outcome of the national census, which is due this week.

At 1510 GMT, the rand was trading at 19.4100 per dollar, down 0.6% from its Friday close.


“Trade in the rand will likely remain cautious as markets wait to see how the Middle East situation develops,” TreasuryONE currency strategist Andre Cilliers said.


As reported by the American news agency, Reuters, the US dollar rose against a basket of global currencies as confrontations between Israeli troops and the Palestinian militant group Hamas increased, sending investors fleeing to the protection of the greenback.

“While South Africa is geographically far removed from the Israel/Gaza conflict, (it) is not deemed to have shown complete neutrality towards the Russian/Ukraine war and concerns exist that this may be repeated, which would undermine the rand further,” Investec economist Annabel Bishop said in a research note.


The results from South Africa’s 2022 census, the first in more than ten years and the fourth population and housing survey since apartheid, will be made public on Tuesday by the country’s statistics office.


It is anticipated to provide an in-depth examination of the economy that will boost planning and growth in the most developed economy in Africa.


The data will be the market’s main focus as it provides information on the South African economy and its battle with high unemployment.


The blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange maintained its position, finishing unchanged. The benchmark 2030 government bond for South Africa was less strong; its yield increased by 4 basis points to 10.93%.

West Africa records growth despite coups and underperformance of its largest economies,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic recovery is defined by certain subregions overperforming in comparison to the regional average and others underperforming.

The World Bank relayed the aforementioned information in its Africa’s Pulse bi-annual report. The global lender identified how Africa is doing based on regional performance, which supports its evaluation.


The report shows that while the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and the largest economies in Africa such as Nigeria and South Africa have underperformed, regions like the East African Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) are performing better than the regional average in 2023.


The presence of large areas of high development and small areas of low growth that are correlated with economic and political stability (or lack thereof) serves as confirmation of the significant diversity in growth between countries in the region.

More than three-quarters of the GDP of Sub-Saharan Africa is generated by the ten largest economies, seven of which are expanding at rates that are below their long-term average growth. Sudan, Ghana, and Angola are three of the nations that will do worse in 2023 than they did from 2001-2019 in terms of growth rates.


Nevertheless, development is anticipated to pick up for the majority of nations as the projected annual average growth rate for 2024-25 is greater than that of 2023 for 39 of the region’s 47 countries.


The report also notes that the largest economy in West Africa, Nigeria, is expected to experience a decline in growth from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023.


Nigeria’s “oil production remains below the OPEC+ quota amid capacity issues and lower international oil prices. Non-oil economic activity—particularly industry and services—still supports growth, although policy actions to remove fuel subsidies and unify the exchange rates might be weighing on these activities in the short term,” the report reads in part.

World Bank projects Africas economy to slow down to 2.5%,"Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic outlook remains bleak amid an elusive growth recovery.
According to the latest World Bank Africa’s Pulse report, rising instability, weak growth in the region’s largest economies, and lingering uncertainty in the global economy are dragging down growth prospects in the region.
Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to decelerate to 2.5% in 2023, from 3.6% in 2022. South Africa’s GDP is expected to only grow by 0.5% in 2023 as energy and transportation bottlenecks continue to bite.



Nigeria and Angola are projected to grow at 2.9% and 1.3% respectively, due to lower international prices and currency pressures affecting oil and non-oil activity.
Increased conflict and violence in the region weigh on economic activity, and this rising fragility may be exacerbated by climatic shocks. In Sudan, economic activity is expected to contract by 12% because of the internal conflict which is halting production, destroying human capital, and crippling state capacity.
In per capita terms, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa has not increased since 2015. In fact, the region is projected to contract at an annual average rate per capita of 0.1% over 2015-2025, thus potentially marking a lost decade of growth in the aftermath of the 2014-15 plunge in commodity prices.
“The region’s poorest and most vulnerable people continue to bear the economic brunt of this slowdown, as weak growth translates into slow poverty reduction and poor job growth,” said Andrew Dabalen, World Bank Chief Economist for Africa.
“With up to 12 million young Africans entering the labor market across the region each year, it has never been more urgent for policymakers to transform their economies and deliver growth to people through better jobs.”
Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a few bright spots. Inflation is expected to decline from 9.3% in 2022 to 7.3% in 2023 and fiscal balances are improving in African countries that are pursuing prudent and coordinated macroeconomic policies.
In 2023, the Eastern African community (EAC) is expected to grow by 4.9% while the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is set to grow by 5.1%. However, debt distress remains widespread with 21 countries at high risk of external debt distress or in debt distress as of June 2023.
Overall, current growth rates in the region are inadequate to create enough high-quality jobs to meet increases in the working-age population.
Current growth patterns generate only 3 million formal jobs annually, thus leaving many young people underemployed and engaged in casual, piecemeal, and unstable work that does not make full use of their skills.
Creating job opportunities for the youth will drive inclusive growth and turn the continent’s demographic wealth into an economic dividend.
“The urgency of the jobs challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored by the huge opportunity from demographic transitions that we have seen in other regions,” said Nicholas Woolley, World Bank Economist and contributor to the report.
“This will require an ecosystem that facilitates private-sector development and firm growth, as well as skill development that matches business demand.”
The development of labor-intensive manufacturing seems to be missing in Africa, limiting further effects for the indirect job creation in support services and international trade. This may be partly due to a lack of capital, which continues to hamper the structural transformation required for good quality jobs.
While the region contributes 12% of the global working age population, Sub-Saharan Africa owns only 2% of the global capital stock. This means people have fewer assets with which to be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to other regions.
The report identifies a set of policies to overcome hurdles and unleash job creation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including:
Cost-effective private sector reforms, focused on increasing competition, uniform policy enforcement across firm sizes, and regulatory alignment with regional trading partners.
Governments can also help identify and support early-stage growth of businesses through more inclusive procurement practices and promotion of local businesses abroad.
Investment in education is necessary to boost semi-skilled occupations for the region. Interventions that improve learning in school are more effective than those increasing school attendance alone, while vocational education can be useful for addressing the underemployed and those who have missed out on education as children.
Education of girls and access to jobs for women can reduce potential productivity loss from the misallocation of female labor. Cash transfers have proven effective in increasing girls’ school enrollment and attendance, as well as in curbing pregnancies among school-age girls.

Billion dollar opioid addiction market fuels Nigerias drug crisis,"A growing market of addiction to synthetic opioids estimated at over $1 billion has been identified as the fastest-growing challenge in Nigeria’s drug crisis, apart from cocaine and heroin trafficking.
The emerging challenge is fuelled by the activities of organized crime syndicates that specialize in the production, use, and trafficking of drugs, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the National Institute for Security Studies (NISS).
With a total of 16 methamphetamine labs seized by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) as of 2019, opioid production is aided by the importation of certain chemicals for the local pharmaceutical industry.



“The most important domestic drug market is that of synthetic opioids. The number of consumers is so large that the market is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion annually, likely marking Nigeria’s single highest-value drug market,” the report states.
Most opioid usage is reportedly connected to Tramadol, which comes in pill form. Although not illicit, the wide non-medical use in Nigeria is illegal.


Almost all the tramadol seized in Nigeria in containers between 2011 and 2019 was manufactured in South and Southeast Asia. Ports in Benin Republic and Togo, which often serve as conduits for goods destined for Nigeria, also seize large volumes of the drug.
Following the import and production ban of codeine cough syrup in Nigeria in 2018, it is likely that supplies are being diverted from neighboring countries, the report said.
Prices of tramadol in Nigeria rose five-fold between 2017 and 2021. Moreover, Nigeria remains a hub in the transnational cocaine and heroin trade, with cocaine coming from Latin America using Nigeria and neighboring countries as a transit hub also a matter of concern. Most cocaine couriered into Nigeria today comes from São Paolo (Brazil) through Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) to Cotonou (Benin Republic) or Lagos (Nigeria).
While Nigeria has a system in place to limit the distribution of controlled medicines to licensed pharmacists, it appears to be widely disregarded. As one group of academics observed
Much of the cannabis produced is consumed locally, while most of the methamphetamine produced seems to be exported.
A prisoner interviewed by UNODC for the report explaining the details of his role as a recruiter of labour for a cannabis plantation said he recruited dozens of boys from his community who were transported by bus to work for a year on cannabis fields in another state.

The boys were paid N120,000 naira for one year’s work after their living costs had been deducted. Some of the boys used these funds to buy cannabis to sell in the city.
In this way, part of the distribution network proceeded organically from the cultivation operation.
One survey of communities in Bayelsa State found that “the typical cultivator was a wealthy or a rich man with a strong network and connections with government officials.”
One cultivator interviewed in prison by UNODC described a 50-member association of farmers with democratically elected officers to represent their common interests, including protection from law enforcement.
The chairman of this group was said to be a person of considerable social and financial influence.
The cultivator interviewed claimed to net N2 million (about $5,000) per year.
Citing the NDLEA, the report shows that cannabis sold for between N40,000 and N50,000 naira for a 50-kilogram bag in 2015 and N25,000 for a 25-kilogram bag in 2016.
Although there has been considerable seasonal variation, with dry season prices rising to N80, 000 per bag.
On the low end, this is about $100 for 50 kilograms, or one-fifth of one US cent per gram, suggesting a low-quality, low-investment bulk product.

The relatively cheap product can generate significant profits for the people who work in the market.
Distributors reported purchasing large volumes of cannabis and reselling them for two or three times the purchase price. One female prisoner, who bought from a source and sold to urban retailers, reported getting a loan for this purpose from a registered microfinance bank in Nigeria.

Nigeria aims for $5 billion tech investment by 2027,"Nigeria is setting its sights on attracting $5 billion in annual tech startup investments by 2027, unveiling a strategic plan to bolster the local tech ecosystem and foster innovation.
Dr. Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communications, Innovation, and Digital Economy, announced this ambitious goal as part of the country’s broader plan to accelerate its digital economy.
In a report titled “Accelerating our Collective Prosperity through Technical Efficiency: A Strategic Plan for the Federal Ministry of Communications, Innovation & Digital Economy,” Dr. Tijani highlighted the pivotal role of innovation, entrepreneurship, and access to financing in the global tech landscape. He emphasized the ministry’s commitment to nurturing startups, particularly those pioneering groundbreaking solutions across key economic sectors, Business Insider Africa reported.



Acknowledging the importance of patient capital in startup growth, the minister stated that the ministry aims to boost the availability of such capital locally. The objective is to create an environment conducive to startups raising the necessary funds to thrive within Nigeria, ultimately encouraging more startups to establish themselves in the country.
To measure the effectiveness of this strategy, Dr. Tijani outlined a clear target: “Increase capital raised by Nigerian tech startups 50 percent year-on-year from ~$1 billion/yr in 2022 to $5 billion/yr in 2027.”
Furthermore, the ministry plans to establish an active sandbox environment to inspire and empower entrepreneurs and innovators to devise specialized solutions for industries that have had limited exposure to technological advancements.
Nigeria also aims to substantially boost the domiciliation of local tech startups, with a target of increasing it from less than 1 percent to 25 percent by 2027. This move is expected to enhance the startups’ contributions to the Nigerian economy significantly.
Dr. Tijani stressed the growing significance of digital transformation and innovation as drivers of economic progress. He underscored the unique opportunity presented by the intersection of a robust digital economy and Nigeria’s innovative and youthful population, envisioning a path toward prosperity, inclusivity, and global relevance.

Punitive domestic tariffs threaten African trade,"Tariff and non-tariff barriers in the country remain a real threat to the vision of a liberalised African trade market under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
This is despite the fact that Ghana’s legal framework supports free trade, says a study that revealed tariff barriers are imposed as taxes and duties on imports – while non-tariff barriers (NTBs) encompass protectionist policies against foreign trade.
Combined, it said, they threaten the idea of a free continental free trade market.



Under the AFCFTA’s mandate for gradually reducing tariffs and eliminating non-tariff barriers, Ghana is expected to liberalise tariffs over ten years and remove non-tariff barriers.
“Removing these restrictions will significantly increase trade within African countries,” says the study dubbed— Situational analysis of Ghana’s AFCFTA preparedness: a review of the legal, policy and regulatory Framework for implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA in Ghana).
Produced by Ishmael Yamson & Associates and Sam Okudzeto & Associates on behalf of the University of Professional Studies-Accra (UPSA) Law School, the report underscores the necessity of addressing certain challenges within the domestic legal framework to enhance the AfCFTA’s implementation.
These challenges encompass the absence of harmonisation in laws, regulations and standards across the continent.
The report suggests the country should strive to align its laws with those of other African nations to facilitate the smooth movement of goods and services across borders.
Furthermore, it highlights that insufficient funding for policy implementation, coupled with a deficiency in the necessary skills for policy execution – along with issues such as transparency deficits, inconsistent and overlapping regulations and a centralised and costly bureaucratic system – pose significant challenges.
These challenges make enforcement difficult, and compliance confusing and costly; further impeding the country’s effective participation in the free trade area.
Ghana must excel in AfCFTA implementation
In response to the report, Dr. Fareed Arthur, Head-National AfCFTA Coordination Office, expressed gratitude to UPSA Law School and the authors for their extensive work.
He also mentioned that while he appreciates the report, there are certain points on which he holds differing opinions.
“Depending on where and what you are looking at, the issue of preparedness comes out differently. It [AfCFTA] is a new experiment. We are still negotiating parts of the World Trade Organisation protocols even after its existence for over 50 years. In these agreements, you can never be entirely prepared because it’s an ongoing and evolving process.  AfCFTA is not a one-time event that you prepare for and then simply sit,” said Dr. Arthur.
With that said, he believes the study’s findings will contribute to the government’s efforts in harnessing the benefits which AfCFTA bring, saying: “The narrative is that Ghana consistently perceives itself as a leading force in the political liberation of this continent. We believe that AfCFTA represents the economic frontier, and as such Ghana must excel in its implementation”.
AfCTA must never fail
The commencement of AfCFTA creates the world’s largest free trade area, encompassing the most countries in its reach.
This historic pact links 55 countries, uniting 1.3 billion people and boasting a collective gross domestic product (GDP) valued at US$ 3.4 trillion.
Moreover, it holds the promise of uplifting 30 million individuals from extreme poverty. However, realising its full potential hinges on the implementation of substantial policy reforms and the facilitation of trade.
Deputy Trade and Industry Minister, Michael Okyere Baafi – who launched the report, emphasised that the concept of free trade on the continent is not only a game-changer but also an opportunity for Africans to discover and leverage the potential of Africa to their advantage.
He also envisions this development as a means to transform the African continent into a place that is regarded as the best in the world by everyone.
“We are exploring Africa to see the opportunities available. So, let’s make sure that Africans take advantage of all the opportunities available in Africa. This is the way to make the continent rich and avoid travelling to the West for loans,” he said.
“So, we cannot fail. It’s important that as a country we strive to ensure this concept [AfCFTA] works, as host of the secretariat. It must never be allowed to fail,” he added.

"Ofori-Atta commends G20 for AUs inclusion, urges common voice","The Minister for Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta says Africa now has the opportunity to contribute to key global issues and push for common interests that would help accelerate economic development in the region.
Mr. Ofori-Atta’s optimism follows the recent inclusion of the African Union in the Group of 20 most important industrialized and developing economies, also known as the G20. It becomes the second regional bloc to join the group after the European Union.
‘There had been several decisions taken without Africa on the board and thank God the G20 agreed that Africa will have a seat so we will be part of the designing the solutions to our Global challenges,’’ the Finance Minister said.



He was speaking at a panel on the Energy Transition Accelerator organized by the Rockefeller Foundation on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly.
The minister added that the inclusion is long overdue, hoping that it will create a balance in global institutions.
The Group of 20
The G20 was formed as an informal group in 1999 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, providing a platform for finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 of the world’s largest and emerging economies. It later included heads of state and governments.
The group has since widened its scope beyond finance and economics, adding some of the world’s pressing challenges to its agenda. It includes health, climate change, food security, energy and sustainable development.
‘Our admission provides another opportunity to push for accelerated reforms in the global financial system to ensure developing nations are treated fairly,’ Mr Ofori-Atta said.
Until the admission of the African Union as a permanent member, the 19-member group jointly accounted for more than 80% of global productivity, 75% of global trade and about two-thirds of the world’s population.
Despite Africa joining the group with 3% of global economic output, the 55 member states come with a population of 1.3 billion people, largely in their youthful and productive stages of life.
The continent is aggressively pushing for inclusion at all international tables where decisions that affect its people are taken.
The Finance Minister said Africa will come with common positions on issues of international concern, especially the ones that affect the continent the most.
‘Africa will speak with one voice to ensure we make good use of our membership to help realize the aspirations of our people,’ Mr Ofori-Atta stated.",citibusinessnews,"Africa, Featured","September 21, 2023",https://citibusinessnews.com/2023/09/ofori-atta-commends-g20-for-aus-inclusion-urges-common-voice/
Transport owners and the missing NPA: who assured Sentuo to import BRVs?,"Ghana’s petroleum downstream has about 5000 Bulk Road Vehicles (BRVs), out of which 4200 have installed tracking devices.
There has been about 50% increment in the number of BRVs from 2013 to 2021.
However, this increment resulted in a decline of average volumes per BRV by about 30% within the same period.



This implies that there has been excess supply of BRVs within the petroleum downstream which is likely to affect the profitability and sustainability of the transport sector of the industry.
The operation of BRVs goes through a series of license compliance. The first is that investors interested in the transport sector of the industry must be licensed by the National Petroleum Authority.
Section 11 (1) and (2) of the NPA act (691) stipulates that none, neither a person nor an entity could operate within the petroleum downstream without being granted a license to operate by the Board.
This means that no Transport company could operate in the sector without approval from NPA.
Further, the NPA has outsourced BRV inspections to two companies to inspect the viability of these vehicles for petroleum distribution.
Also, BRV companies pay between Ghc12,650 and Ghc24,000 annually to their facilities inspected based on their status.
Again, these companies pay from Ghc750 per vehicle to Ghc1200 per vehicle depending on the number of litres the vehicle could transport.
Although the average performance per BRV has declined, the regulator continues to charge these license fees.
The NPA has also restricted foreign participation or foreign interest in the transportation of petroleum products in Ghana.
Any company interested in distributing or transporting petroleum products across the country must be a 100% Ghanaian owned company.
Noncompliance with these requirements means the company cannot work in the petroleum downstream.
It was surprising to read media reports on alleged importation of about 600 BRVs by Sentuo Oil Refinery Limited to operate as transporters of petroleum products in the Petroleum Downstream.
The surprise stems from the fact that there is excess supply of BRVs already in the industry, which hardly achieve their investment targets.
Also, Sentuo Oil Refinery Company Limited could not import BRVs to distribute products without being approved or assured by the regulator. Or is the NPA arguing that the said company is operating without BRV license?
The NPA based on the industry reports of the unsustainability of the transport sector and the compliance of license requirements before one can operate as a BRV company, have no justification to excuse themselves of this economic injurious crime against the Ghanaian Content and Participation Policy in the petroleum downstream.

Five-year performance of GCB equity on the Ghana Stock Exchange,"Investing in shares or stock or equity should be done with a long term view, this is because historically, the stock market outperforms all other asset classes particularly the traditional asset classes being T-Bills and bonds in the long term, beating inflation and recording significant returns.
The stock market is known to record over 110% returns on equity investments (capital appreciation) during bullish market periods which lasts averagely for four (4) years.
To realise or achieve significant capital appreciation or gains in share or equity price, investors are advised to continuously invest in the stock market for not less than five (5) years.



Hence, an investment into a particular equity for at least five (5) years is ample time to assess its performance, at least over the medium-term.
In this write-up, the five year performance of listed equity of State-Owned Bank, GCB, will be analysed looking at its market capitalization, volume-weighted average price (VWAP), earnings per share and price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio).
EPS
An earning per share (EPS) is used to evaluate a company’s profitability and potential for growth in earnings. It is a measure of how much profit a company generates per share.
The higher the EPS, the more profitable a company is and the more attractive it is to investors.
GCB has over the last five years (including the 8 months period of 2023), recorded high EPS above the overall average EPS of the various financial companies listed on the GSE.
In 2019 for instance, the EPS of GCB equity (GHS 1.14) was more than twice (127.9%) the average EPS (GHS 0.50) of listed financial stocks.
Same was the case in 2022 when EPS of GCB equity (GHS 2.33) outperformed the average EPS of listed financial stocks (GHS 1.04) by +12,400bps (124%).
EPS of GCB equity which currently stands at GHS 2.51 is +14,600bps (146%) higher than the average EPS of listed financial equities which stands at GHS 1.02.
The import of GCB equity consistently recording a higher EPS above the average EPS for listed financial stocks is that, in terms of profitability over the last five year period, GCB has performed relatively well compared to its peers, making it attractive to investors.
VWAP
The Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of GCB equity, simply measures the average price of the stock/equity over a period of time which is usually a full trading day.
VWAP is a single-day technical analysis indicator used in intraday charts that restarts at the open of each new trading day.
VWAP helps investors and analysts evaluate the current price of a stock to determine whether it is relatively overpriced or underpriced compared to the average trading price for the day. Often investors use this information to either buy or sell an equity or share or stock during the day’s trading session.
When the average trading price (VWAP) of an equity is below the overall average trading price of listed equities on a bourse, that particular equity is seen as underpriced or undervalued by investors. In the same vein, when the average trading price (VWAP) of an equity is above the overall average trading price of listed equities on a bourse, that particular equity is seen as overpriced or overvalued by investors.
Investors then tend to buy (enter) the equity when it is underpriced and cheap to later sell (exit) the equity when it is overpriced and expensive, thereby making some capital gains.
Over the last five years – 2018 to 2022 – the average trading price (VWAP) of GCB equity has consistently outperformed the overall average trading price (VWAP) of financial equities (shares of banks and other financial institutions) listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE).
The average price of GCB equity on the last trading day of 2019 for instance, was GHS 5.10, some +1,970bps (19.7%) higher than the overall average price of GHS 4.26 for financial equities listed on the local bourse.
At end-2021, GCB equity recorded a much higher average price of GHS 5.24 which was +3,260bps (32.6%) higher than the GHS 3.95 overall average price recorded by the financial equities.
As at August 18, 2023, the VWAP of GCB equity stood at GHS 3.50, some +1,550bps (15.5%) higher than the GHS 3.03 VWAP of all listed financial equities.
Given that the average trading price (VWAP) of GCB equity is mostly higher than the overall average trading price (VWAP) of listed financial stocks, the GCB equity has been viewed as relatively over-priced by investors over the five year period.
P/E Ratio
The P/E ratio is indicative of how investors value a company’s ability to grow its income in the years ahead, a higher P/E ratio means investors expect higher income growth from the company whereas a lower P/E ratio implies that investors do not expect high income growth from the company.
The P/E ratio is also indicative of how much cedis investors are willing to pay or invest in a company by way of shares acquisition in order to receive or earn GHS 1 of the company’s earnings or profit.
What this means is that, if for instance, a company is currently trading with P/E ratio of 10, then the interpretation is that an investor is willing to pay GHS 10 for the company’s shares to receive GHS 1 of the earnings of the company when it makes a profit.
Now, contrary to the higher-than-average EPS recorded by GCB equity over the last five years, P/E ratio of the equity remained below the average P/E ratio of listed financial equities.
P/E ratio of GCB equity from 2018 to 2022 on year-on-year (yoy) basis declined from 7 to 4 to 3 to 2.89 and then to 1.69 at end-2022.
For the eight months period of 2023, the P/E ratio of GCB equity is currently 1.
The decline in P/E ratio of GCB equity was reflective of the general decline in the average P/E ratio of listed financial equities.
In 2018, the P/E ratio of GCB equity stood at 7 which was -6,420bps (64.2%) lower than the average P/E ratio of 11.5 for listed financial equities.
In 2022 however, the average P/E ratio of listed financial equities had dropped to 5.28 as against the 1.69 P/E ratio for GCB equity.
The fall in average P/E for listed financial equities from 11.5 to 5.28 indicates a -5,408bps (54.08%) drop in average P/E ratio over the five year period.
The continuous fall in the P/E ratio of GCB equity from 7 in 2018 to 1.69 in 2022 is indicative of investors declining optimism in the company’s ability to record higher income growth in the years ahead.
It is also indicative that investors are willing to pay or invest less and less money into the bank by way of shares acquisition in order to receive GHS 1 of the company’s earnings or profit.
Market Capitalization
Market capitalization of GCB equity as at 2018 was GHS 1,219m representing 8.6% share of the GHS 14,167m total market capitalization of listed financial equities on the local bourse.
The total market capitalization of GHS 14,167m for financial equities represented 23.17% of the GSE’s total market capitalization of GHS 61,136m in 2018.
As at 2022, the market capitalization of GCB equity was GHS 1,044m representing 7.57% share of the GHS 13,774m total market capitalization of listed financial equities.
Market capitalization of GCB equity as at August 18, 2023 stood at GHS 928m which represents 7.88% share of the GHS 11,770m total market capitalization of financial stocks.
Currently, the total market capitalization of the GSE stands at GHS 72,998m of which the total market capitalization of financial equities constitute 16.12% share of the overall equity market.
Over the last five years, GCB equity’s share of the total market capitalization of listed financial equities has ranged from 7.5% to 11%.
Changes in the market capitalization of GCB equity and consequently its share of the total market capitalization of listed financial equities are on the back of the volatility in the share price of the equity.

Upholding financial stability of Ghanas energy sector:  Why IPPs cannot accept debt haircut amid governments economic challenges,"The energy landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by the growing role of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in meeting global electricity demands. In the intricate landscape of deregulated electricity markets, the role of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) is pivotal in driving electricity generation and supply.
Recent debt haircut proposals by Government of Ghana (GoG), driven by economic challenges, have triggered discussions on the potential ramifications for IPPs. This paper reveals the fundamental reasons behind IPPs’ reluctance to accept debt haircut proposals and highlights some important industry references that underscore the implications of such a stance for the energy sector, investor confidence, and sustainable development.
Guardians of Energy Infrastructure



Independent Power Producers (IPPs) play a pivotal role in ensuring energy security. They invest significant resources in developing and operating power generation facilities, making them essential partners in the energy ecosystem.
IPPs as pillars of energy stability operate within a multifaceted energy system where they balance financial sustainability, regulatory compliance, and energy supply to meet growing demand. Their contribution is vital not only to energy generation but also to the overall stability of the market. As at date, the IPPs in Ghana have invested close to USD5billion (privately and commercially contracted debt and equity) in energy infrastructure.
Ensuring and Maintaining Financial Viability
IPPs operate as commercial entities, and their financial viability depends on generating sufficient revenue to cover their operational costs, debt obligations, and returns to their investors. Accepting a debt haircut could severely impact their financial health and ability to meet these obligations that comes with very strict commercial terms, including non-negotiable penal clauses. (International Finance Corporation (IFC) emphasizes the need for revenue predictability and long-term financial sustainability to attract private investments in energy projects.).
Investor Confidence:
Accepting debt haircuts might erode investor confidence in the Independent Power Producers in the Ghanaian energy sector. Investors seek reliable returns and stable operating environments, and debt haircuts could introduce uncertainty, deterring future investments. (Reference: The World Bank’s “Doing Business” report underscores how stable regulatory environments, free from arbitrary policy changes, are pivotal in maintaining investor confidence).
Contractual Obligations and Regulatory Certainty:
IPPs typically enter into long-term contracts with various stakeholders, including lenders, suppliers, and off-takers. Accepting a debt haircut could trigger breaches of these contracts, leading to legal disputes and further financial strain. A debt haircut proposal might signal regulatory uncertainty or instability in the market, potentially discouraging IPPs from making long-term investments or commitments that drive technological innovation and energy expansion. (Global Energy Storage Alliance (GESA) stresses the importance of regulatory predictability in fostering investor trust and ensuring the stability of energy investments and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) underscores the value of long-term contracts in enhancing market predictability and supporting consistent investments in the energy sector.
Credit Rating Impact:
A debt haircut could lead to credit rating downgrades for IPPs, making it more expensive for them to secure financing for future projects. This, in turn, would hinder their growth and expansion plans.
Market Credibility and Business Continuity:
Debt haircuts could undermine the credibility of the energy market as a whole, raising questions about the financial stability of both IPPs and the broader sector. Debt haircuts disrupt this financial equilibrium, jeopardizing their ability to meet these commitments. This might dissuade potential investors and disrupt market dynamics. (International Energy Agency (IEA): highlights that policy stability and investor-friendly regulations are essential for achieving sustainable energy transitions and fostering private investments).
Market Confidence: 
A debt haircut proposal might undermine confidence in the overall deregulated electricity market. Other market participants, including consumers, may become concerned about the financial stability of the market, impacting its functioning and competitiveness.
Lack of Guarantees:
Given the economic turbulence, IPPs are the most worried and concerned about the government’s ability to honor any new payment arrangements that arise from the proposal. Times without number, promises have failed and as a result, trust is lost.
Contract Renegotiation Concerns:
Accepting a debt haircut could set a precedent for other contractual re-negotiations, possibly leading to pressure on IPPs to renegotiate other aspects of their contracts jeopardizing the sustainability and continuity of the investment. Other stakeholders might also approach IPPs with similar proposals, leading to a moral hazard situation where responsible financial practices are not incentivized.
IPPs Contribution to the Ghanaian Economy:
IPPs contribute to in no small measure to Ghana’s economy through job creation, infrastructure development, and tax revenue. Financial instability caused by debt haircuts could compromise these economic contributions.
Lack of Guarantees:
If the local government proposing the debt haircut is facing economic problems, IPPs might be concerned about the government’s ability to honor any new payment arrangements that arise from the proposal.
Impact on Operations:
The reduction in revenues resulting from a debt haircut could impact the maintenance and operational activities of the IPPs, potentially leading to reduced reliability and efficiency of power generation. Reference: World Economic Forum (WEF) highlights how IPPs contribute to driving energy transition, innovation, and competitiveness within the energy market.
Striking a Balance:
While acknowledging the economic challenges faced by Government of Ghana (GoG), the energy sector’s sustainability and investor confidence cannot be compromised. Independent Power Producers are essential guardians of energy infrastructure and enablers of socio-economic growth. A collaborative approach involving governments, regulatory bodies, and IPPs is necessary to find solutions that ensure financial stability for all parties while safeguarding the reliable supply of electricity.
As we navigate the complexities of the energy transition, the importance of a stable and supportive regulatory framework cannot be overstated. By addressing the economic challenges in a manner that preserves the integrity of contractual obligations and fosters a conducive investment environment, we can continue to advance towards a sustainable energy future.

The crucial role of IPPs in ensuring energy security and fueling developing economies [Article],"conoIn an era where energy is the lifeblood of progress, the role of independent power producers (IPPs) emerges as a beacon of innovation, resilience, and transformative change.
As developing economies strive to carve a path toward prosperity and self-sufficiency, the significance of IPPs in bolstering energy security and driving economic growth cannot be overstated. This article delves into the pivotal role of IPPs in shaping the destiny of nations, ensuring energy security, and igniting the engines of a dynamic developing economy.
A Foundation for Energy Security:



Energy security forms the bedrock upon which a nation’s progress rests. Reliable access to electricity is not merely a convenience; it is a prerequisite for economic activity, essential services, and the well-being of citizens. Independent power producers inject a vital dose of stability into the energy equation by diversifying the sources of energy production and distribution.
The ability of IPPs to generate electricity from a range of resources, including renewables like solar, wind, and hydro, reduces vulnerability to supply disruptions. This diversity minimizes the impact of unforeseen events, be they geopolitical conflicts or market fluctuations, and ensures a consistent energy supply that sustains industries, supports healthcare and drives education. The result is a stronger, more resilient energy infrastructure that empowers nations to navigate uncertainties and pursue sustainable growth.
Catalyzing Economic Growth:
A developing economy thrives on innovation, investment, and the ability to harness its resources efficiently. Independent power producers infuse a dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship into the energy sector, stimulating economic growth through private-sector participation. By leveraging their expertise and capital, IPPs accelerate the development of energy projects that may have otherwise been delayed due to budgetary constraints or bureaucratic hurdles.
Furthermore, IPPs create a ripple effect that reverberates across sectors. The energy they generate serves as a catalyst, powering factories, spurring job creation, and attracting foreign investment. As industries flourish and expand, the cycle of economic growth gains momentum, elevating the nation’s standing on the global stage and enhancing its capacity to meet the needs of its citizens.
Driving Technological Advancement:
In the realm of energy, technology is the driving force behind innovation and progress. Independent power producers, unburdened by the inertia of traditional utilities, are at the forefront of embracing cutting-edge technologies. From smart grids that optimize energy distribution to advanced monitoring systems that enhance efficiency, IPPs pave the way for a future characterized by intelligent, sustainable energy solutions.
As IPPs deploy state-of-the-art technologies, they create a ripple effect that extends beyond the energy sector. The infusion of technological advancements into the economy fuels a culture of innovation, spurring research and development, and nurturing a generation of tech-savvy professionals. This virtuous cycle contributes to a robust, adaptable economy that is equipped to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.
Energizing a Promising Future:
In the grand tapestry of progress, independent power producers emerge as architects of transformation, weaving threads of energy security, economic vitality, and technological advancement. Their ability to diversify energy sources, stimulate economic growth, and drive technological innovation positions them as indispensable partners in the journey of developing economies.
As nations steer their course toward a promising future, IPPs stand as luminous guides, illuminating the path to sustainable energy security and prosperity. By embracing their role, developing economies can harness the power of independence to unlock untapped potential, unleash innovation, and write a new chapter of progress that resonates across generations.

New tax on plastic packaging in GhanaWill this solve the problem of plastic waste?,"The use of plastic materials is convenient, and it is the preferred choice by both manufacturers and consumers due to its lightweight and its ability to store and prevent food contamination but globally, the effect of plastics on the environment is devastating especially when it is improperly managed.
Because Plastic packaging is typically used for a short period of time and thereafter disposed-off, they cause great danger to the environment. From choking of gutters to threats to marine waters, affecting fishing activities.
According to a BBC report, more than 1.3 billion tonnes of plastic could enter the environment globally by the year 2040 and 95% of these plastic products are for single use with only 5% being recycled.



To deal with the problem of plastic waste, governments around the world adopt measures to encourage recycled plastic to help tackle plastic waste rather than being sent to landfills.
Research has however found that, recycling plastic is often more expensive than using new plastic. Some countries therefore completely ban single-use plastics packaging whiles other countries use tax policies to discourage plastic use.
Using tax policy to deal with plastic waste
One way to deal with the problem of plastic waste is to discourage the use of plastic in packaging. Plastic packaging tax (PPT) is one way to discourage the use of plastic materials. Such a tax will aim at encouraging the use of less new plastic by levying additional tax on all plastic products, which will lead to increase in prices of plastic products.
Effect of a plastic packaging tax
The possible effect of a Plastic packaging tax is that producers will adopt packaging materials that is easier to recycle and discourage them from creating plastic packaging which is difficult to recycle. Businesses will be more conscious of the impact of their plastic packaging decisions on the environment and drive a change in attitude to a more environmentally friendly packaging.
Key tax policy considerations
Any intention to introduce a plastic packaging tax should consider the scope of the tax. It should apply to both produced or imported plastic packaging which uses insufficient recycled content. For example, if a packaging component contains certain amount of plastic, the tax should then apply.
Plastic packaging manufactured or imported for use in the packaging of a medicinal product can be considered exempt from the tax due to the essential use of the package.
This is critical because we cannot entirely deal away with plastic. Thus, defining products within the scope of the tax is crucial for its implementation. Other consideration should focus on the rate of tax in order not to make goods and service extremely expensive. The exact point at which the tax is charge is also important to be determined to avoid a cascading effect of the tax.
Past policies to deal with plastic waste
The government in an attempt to deal with plastic waste introduced 10 % Environmental Excise Tax (EET) under the Customs and Excise (Duties and Other Taxes) (Amendment) ACT, 2013, (Act 863). The law provided that, the tax shall be computed on the Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value of plastic and plastic products imported and it is paid at the point of entry into Ghana.
The law also provided that, not less than 50% of the revenue accruing shall be paid into a Fund designated as “Plastic Waste Recycling Fund” and the revenue accruing shall be dedicated to recycling of plastic waste and production of plastic waste bins and bags and the production and use of biodegradable plastics.
The Minister for Local Government and Rural Development shall in consultation with the Minister for Finance specify the use and modalities for the use of the moneys and the Minister for Local Government and Rural Development shall, at the end of each year submit to Parliament a report on the use of the moneys.
The Ghana Plastic Manufacturers Association (GPMA) in 2019 said the 10 per cent Environmental Excise Tax (EET) that was introduced in 2013 had accrued a total sum of GH¢912 million, and the amount had been paid into the Consolidated Fund because the Fund’s secretariat was yet to be set-up.
According to the GPMA, when the money accrued is used effectively, government could build ultra-modern waste recycling plants to deal with the issue of plastic waste.
In July 2021, The Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, (MESTI), Dr. Kwaku Afriyie hinted that government is considering a plastic waste management policy that will impose certain levies on consumers who use plastic products.
Conclusion
Manufacturers and importers of plastic packaging products may need to prepare for the new tax on plastic wastes. Consumers must embrace themselves for increases in prices of plastic products. Since Plastic packaging tax (PPT) is an environmental tax designed to create incentive for environmentally friendly packaging, entrepreneurs can take advantage of this new policy to start producing paper bags which are environmentally friendly.
The amount received from the plastic tax should be put to its appropriate use. It is unclear how the amount collected from the 2013 10 % Environmental Excise Tax (EET) has been utilized.

Golden nectar: Uncovering Ghanas blossoming honey industry,"Ghana has a long history of beekeeping, dating back to the 16th century. The country is home to a wide variety of bees, including stingless bees, honey bees, and carpenter bees. Honey is a valuable product in Ghana, and it is used for both food and medicinal purposes.
The honey industry in Ghana has been gaining attention in recent years due to its potential to contribute significantly to food security, employment, and income generation (https://lnkd.in/dUqw5gKg; https://lnkd.in/dH_Qzw2s; https://lnkd.in/dhT62M_U).
Honey production has been increasing, but it is still far below its potential, with an estimated 500,000 tonnes of honey per annum worth about $1.5 billion (https://lnkd.in/dhT62M_U). The beekeeping and honey industry in Ghana is predominantly smallholder and is mostly found in the Northern, Brong Ahafo, and Ashanti regions (https://lnkd.in/dH_Qzw2s; https://lnkd.in/dYAuzHMU; https://lnkd.in/dv94Aw8F).



These regions have a favourable environment for beekeeping due to the presence of forests, savannahs, and vegetation, which provide ample forage for bees (https://www.theafricareport.com/184850/ghana-can-bees-be-key-to-sweetening-the-economy/; https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ghana-entrepreneur-capitalises-on-opportunity-in-honey-and-beekeeping-industry/118267/). Tilaa, a beekeeping and cashew nut business, is headquartered in Tamale and operates in the Mion District, one of the regions with a strong beekeeping industry (https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ghana-entrepreneur-capitalises-on-opportunity-in-honey-and-beekeeping-industry/118267/).
Current Production and Trade Volume of Honey in Ghana
The honey industry in Ghana is largely untapped, and lack of investment has hindered the industry’s potential (https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/). The industry’s value globally was estimated at US$2.2 billion in 2016, with an increasing demand for honey as a healthier replacement for sugar (https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/;https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/ghana-news-increasing-demand-for-honey-time-to-attend-to-beekeeping-industry.html).
However, the beekeepers in Ghana have failed to fully exploit this huge potential, accounting for less than 1% of the global honey market share (https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/ghana-news-increasing-demand-for-honey-time-to-attend-to-beekeeping-industry.html). In 2021, Ghana produced an estimated 1,500 metric tonnes of honey.
The majority of this honey is consumed domestically, but a small amount is exported. The main export markets for Ghanaian honey are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. The global honey market size was estimated at $ 8.58 billion in 2021 and was expected to reach $9.01 billion in 2022. The top exporters of honey globally are New Zealand, China, Argentina, Brazil, and Germany.
The top importers of honey are the United States, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and France. The demand for honey is growing due to its many health benefits. Honey is a natural antibiotic; it can help improve digestion and boost the immune system.
With increasing concerns about the health risks associated with high sugar intake, including heart conditions, obesity, and diabetes, honey offers a healthier alternative, potentially reducing the number of patient-doctor visits related to sugar-related conditions.
According to the Ghana Beekeepers Association (GBA), the cost of one beehive, training, and other necessary inputs was estimated at GH¢750 in 2020. Each hive can produce 21 litres of honey per harvest, with three harvests per year, for a total of 63 litres per annum. This means each beekeeper could produce 3,150 litres or 4,504.5 kg per year. A beehive can last for a minimum of 10 years, which is the average lifespan of a beehive. At the farm gate, a litre of honey was selling for GH¢14 across the country in 2020.
Contribution of Honey Subsector to Food Security, jobs, and Income Generation
The honey subsector plays an important role in food security, employment, and income generation in Ghana. Honey is a valuable source of food and source of income generation for rural households. Beekeeping is a relatively low-cost and labour-intensive activity, and it can be a good source of income for farmers, especially women and youth. The honey industry in Ghana has the potential to provide jobs for thousands of people and improve the income of smallholder farmers (https://www.theafricareport.com/184850/ghana-can-bees-be-key-to-sweetening-the-economy/; https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/; https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ghana-entrepreneur-capitalises-on-opportunity-in-honey-and-beekeeping-industry/118267/).
It can contribute to food security by diversifying income sources for rural households and providing nutritious honey as a food product (https://www.theafricareport.com/184850/ghana-can-bees-be-key-to-sweetening-the-economy/; https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/). Additionally, the honey industry can also play a vital role in supporting the overall agricultural sector in Ghana, as bees contribute to pollination, enhancing crop yields and overall ecosystem health.
Regional Production and Trading Volumes of Honey
The Ashanti Region is the leading producer of honey in Ghana, followed by the Brong Ahafo Region and the Eastern Region. The Ashanti Region produces an estimated 500 metric tonnes of honey per year, while the Brong Ahafo Region produces an estimated 300 metric tonnes per year and the Eastern Region produces an estimated 200 metric tonnes per year. The following table shows the regional production and trading volumes of honey in Ghana in 2020:
Region Production (metric tonnes) Export (metric tonnes)
Ashanti              450                                       100
Brong Ahafo       200                                      50
Central              150                                                     25
Eastern             100                                                      25
Greater Accra         50                                      10
Volta                  50                                            10
Western 50                                                      10
Incentives to Boost Beekeeping and Honey Production
To boost beekeeping and honey production in Ghana, various support systems and initiatives have been implemented. Organisations such as Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ Ghana), Quality Services International GmbH (QSI), and Agrifood Value Chains for Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Market Development (AGRIVIMS) have collaborated on projects to improve the quality and marketability of Ghanaian honey (https://agrictoday.com.gh/2022/02/18/make-ghanas-honey-fit-for-local-and-export-project-launched/).
These initiatives aim to make Ghana’s honey fit for local consumption and export by implementing quality standards, providing training, and establishing market linkages for beekeepers (https://agrictoday.com.gh/2022/02/18/make-ghanas-honey-fit-for-local-and-export-project-launched/). This is also intended to prepare and position the honey value chain in Ghana to explore intra-Africa trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement (AfCFTA).
Impact of Illegal Mining and Climate Change on Beekeeping and Honey Production in Ghana
Nevertheless, the honey industry in Ghana faces challenges such as illegal mining and climate change, which have a negative impact on beekeeping and honey production. Illegal mining, also known as galamsey, destroys natural habitats of bees and other pollinators, reduces floral resources, and contaminates water bodies, which can have adverse effects on bees and their foraging patterns (https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/). Climate change, including unpredictable rainfall patterns and extreme weather events, also affect flowering and nectar availability, ultimately impacting honey production in the country (https://www.beeculture.com/catch-buzz-ghana-wants-piece-global-honey-export-business-intends-fund-growth/).
World Bee Day and Ghana Honey Festival, 2023
Globally, the year 2023, marks the sixth year, in which the UN Bee Day is being celebrated. The 20th of May every year, is a special day on the global calendar to reminisce the essential role pollinators especially bees, play in sustaining biodiversity and food security. Bees and other pollinators are known to make important contributions to agriculture and our food system.
Pollinators affect 35% of global agricultural land, supporting the production of 87% of the major economic crops globally. Also, pollination-dependent crops are five times more valuable than those that do not need pollination. Bees and other pollinators around the world have been reported to be endangered evident in population declines in the abundance and diversity of bees over the last decades as a direct consequence of human activities.
In order to take action on these concerns around the world, the World Bee Day is commemorated to create the platform to educate people about the importance of bees and how they can help preserve them for global food security on the 20th of May each year by the UN and other relevant stakeholders.
In the year, 2020, a young Ghanaian Research Scientist, Dr. Courage Komla Besah-Adanu, initiated the UN Bee Day Celebrations in Ghana, while working as an Entomologist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Forestry Research Institute of Ghana (CSIR-FORIG).
The maiden world bee day and honey festival celebration in Ghana was sponsored largely by the DANIDA Fellowship Centre, Chamber of Agribusiness Ghana (CAG), Agri-Food Value Innovations and Marketing Society (AGRIVIMS), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-FORIG), DANIDA Alumni Association, Ghana (DAN-G), Quality Services International (QSI), International Stingless Bee Centre (ISBC), University of Cape Coast (UCC), Ghana Beekeepers Association (GBA), National Beekeepers Association (NATBA), Volta Regional Association of Beekeepers (VORAB) and Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA).
On Friday, the 19th of May, 2023, Ghana will join other countries in the world made possible by the generous sponsorship of GIZ Ghana and MoFA, to once again, celebrate bees and other pollinators, by spotlighting their critical role in sustaining food security and human existence.
This year’s celebration of World Bee Day and Honey Festival will happen at the CSIR-Food Research Institute, near the Ghana Standards Authority, Shiashie in Accra. The theme for this year is “Bee engaged in pollinator-friendly agricultural production”. The event will bring together experts and key stakeholders from selected regions in Ghana to delve into several aspects of beekeeping, pollinator and agriculture ecosystem interactions parts activities to commemorate the day. Ghana’s most celebrated Entomologist and Pollination Ecologist, Rev. Professor Peter Kwapong, from the University of Cape Coast (Founder and Director of the International Stingless Bee Centre) will keynote the event.
This year’s event will among other things, have an exhibition session. There will also be an “honey tasting session for quality or bad honey”. This is where, men become children, becareful! Even the most experienced beekeeper may miss out in identifying which is quality honey or a bad one!
The General public is hereby invited to this year’s event and exhibition. Come and educate yourself about all you need to know about Beekeeping, Honey, Honey Production, Pollination and all related issues.
In conclusion, while Ghana’s honey industry has significant untapped potential, as it still faces varied challenges. The current production and trade volume of honey in Ghana are below its estimated potential. The honey subsector has the potential to contribute to food security, employment, and income generation, particularly in regions such as Northern, Brong Ahafo, and Ashanti. Efforts are being made by organisations, stakeholders and initiatives to support and boost beekeeping and honey production in Ghana. However, challenges such as illegal mining and climate change need to be addressed to ensure the sustainable growth of the honey industry in the country.
We hope this blog post has been informative. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Potential impacts of recently-introduced taxes on agribusiness in Ghana [Article],"The three new taxes introduced by the government of Ghana in 2023 – the Growth and Sustainability Levy Act (Act 1095), the Excise Duty Amendment Act 2022 (Act 1094), and the Income Tax Amendment Act 2022 (Act 1093) – have raised concerns about potential impacts on agribusiness in Ghana.
While the new taxes have been introduced to raise revenue and meet the conditions for a $3 billion IMF programme, these may pose challenges for agribusinesses, agripreneurs, and consumers, predominantly stakeholders in the agribusiness sector. However, it is worth noting that these taxes build on previous amendments to tax laws that were introduced in the 2022 Mid-year Budget Review.
Additionally, Ghana’s GDP grew by 5.4% in 2021, according to the Ghana Statistical Service, and the Economist Intelligence Unit revealed that Ghana’s real GDP growth strengthened in 2022, albeit slowing down in 2023-24 and picking up again in 2025-26.



It is also worth noting that stakeholders such as the Chamber of Agribusiness Ghana, the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana (PFAG) and partners called on the finance minister to grant tax exemptions on agricultural commodities prior to the introduction of these taxes (as there was an earlier unilateral announcement of the suspension of tax exemptions to key agricultural equipment and raw materials). Regarding corporate income tax, the general rate is 25%, but non-traditional exporters pay an 8% CIT rate, while banks lending to the agricultural sector pay a CIT rate.
Mining and upstream petroleum companies pay CIT at a rate of 35%, while companies primarily engaged in the hotel industry pay a reduced rate of 22%. Again, regarding value-added tax (VAT), the standard VAT rate in Ghana is 15%, and VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services where the supply is taxable.
We envisage the following as potential ramifications of the three new taxes imposed by the government on agribusinesses and recommend how our members can adjust to these actions.
Growth and Sustainability Levy Act, 2023 (Act 1095)
First, as stated in Clause 3 of the Act, since it is not an expense and hence not an acceptable deduction, it will raise the cost of doing business in Ghana. Since it is not a tax deduction, agribusinesses may pass the cost on to consumers by raising the price of their goods and services, which could heighten inflation depending on how elastic consumer demand are for these commodities.
When agribusinesses cannot pass the cost on to consumers, they either have to absorb it themselves or transfer it by cutting back on production or supply, which means fewer jobs and fewer resources would be invested to produce goods and provide services.
Second, it will be challenging to collect this levy from mining and petroleum companies that have stability clauses in their agreements, which state that no change in fiscal legislation shall affect them until after their stability period (which can be anywhere from 15 to 25 years, depending on the agreement). Those that don’t have such provisions will likely try to internalise them, which will raise their production costs and lower their profits, ultimately raising their taxable corporate income.
Third, the Financial Sector Recovery Levy of 5% imposed last year adds to the burden of the National Fiscal Stabilisation Levy’s repeal, making it more expensive for financial firms. Customers are already receiving notices from their banks informing them of a pending increase in the prices they must pay for banking services. This could have an effect on the government’s efforts to expand financial access and increase lending to agribusiness, since individuals or agribusinesses who cannot afford banking services may begin to avoid them.
An inclusive stakeholder involvement could have been the obvious step, as it would have allowed industry stakeholders to make rate recommendations to the government and advocate for changes to corporate tax rates or royalties.
For the mining and petroleum industries, for instance, an increase in the royalty rate from 5-6%, rather than the 1% Levy, would have necessitated discussion for the suspension of portions of the stability clauses. For the sake of efficiency and fairness, the financial sector should have been allowed to deduct at least one of the levies, such as the financial sector recovery levy after the Growth and Sustainability Levy became non-deductible. When added to the 6% previously paid in straight levies for national health insurance (2.5%), the Ghana Education Trust Fund (2.5%), and the Covid-19 Health Recovery (1%), it’s clear that the new sectors should have been hit with a 1% Levy to get things rolling.
Income Tax (Amendment) Act, 2023 (Act 1094)
A new 35% band established ostensibly for the high-net-worth taxation policy is misplaced in the Income Tax Act, while a revision of the income tax bands to fit the minimum wage for 2023 is a typical and usual activity. Instead of changing the income threshold, the income bands might have been shifted to get higher earners into the current 30% bracket.
The GRA’s High Networth Individuals unit (HNIs) has a full roster of HNIs and is still compiling additional HNIs in order to ensure compliance by this segment of taxpayers; at the current rate of 30%, the country can collect more money than the increase in rates would cost. It’s fascinating to see that these people pay taxes at the same rate (35%) as mining and petroleum firms, which is far higher than the rates paid by companies in the hospitality industry (25%), the banking sector (22%), leasing and agricultural sectors (20%). If these wealthy people want to avoid paying taxes at a rate of 35%, why not form corporations and have their dividends subject to a final tax rate of 8%?
The implementation of a withholding tax on the sale of assets and the settlement of liabilities is a positive step in the right direction. Since it is always based on self-assessment, only increased monitoring is required to guarantee compliance.
Refreshingly, it’s great that we can have a universal 5-year loss carryover, which is a fantastic policy move. It is necessary to keep an eye on businesses to ensure they don’t dissolve and reform after every five years to avoid paying taxes. A case of Sankofa is the restriction of foreign exchange losses and the capitalisation of the capital expenditure provisions of the Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act 592), as amended. This is why we constantly advocate for stakeholder participation in the discussion of tax policies to ensure that such inconsistent tax policies are avoided.
Since the accrual basis of accounting is generally recognised for tax purposes, this will result in substantial unrealised exchange losses for taxpayers, putting a strain on their ability to pay their taxes in a timely manner. The burden on taxpayers could have been reduced if we had agreed to accept some portion of unrealised exchange losses (maybe 30% or 50%), given that the difference between the date the loss would be incurred and the date it would actualise is merely a matter of timing.
Fifth, it is encouraging to see a programme aimed at reviewing income tax rates for temporary incentives and phasing them off gradually. This is especially true after 5 years when the loss incurred towards the united goal.
Excise Duty (Amendment) Act, 2023 (Act 1093)
Taxation is not all about raising revenue and so this Act should not be seen exclusively as a revenue raising measure but a measure to deal with importation and consumption of harmful goods. In as much as the increased raises will bring-in some revenue, that cannot be the main purpose. Thus, the rates could have been discussed with stakeholders in the industry.
Again, the regulatory bodies such as Food and Drugs Authority and Ghana Standards Authority should have been empowered to ensure compliance. For example, the sugar content in some of these beverages to deal with addressing the health concerns as in childhood diabetes among others should be the motivation for this tax. More importantly, given the negative effects of cigarette and alcohol use, a rise in excise tax on these products is warranted. Moreso, it is in line with ECOWAS Directives and Ghana being a member has to comply. Again, we need a lot of monitoring to avert and deal with smuggling of these products when the taxes are imposed.
In addition to the impact of the excise duty, where businesses can pass on the increased duty forward by way of increase in prices, they may likely do so and that would impact prices and possibly commodity inflation. However, where they are unable to pass it forward, they may pass it backward by cutting down on production; thus, reducing costs of inputs including labour, hence a possible loss of jobs and an increase in unemployment. This is so because the industries are already dealing with increases in the cost of utilities – water and electricity – as well as increase in VAT by 2.5%, along the straight levies. The proposal would be to revert the straight levies into claimable VAT to ease the cost buildup for businesses.
Recommendations to Agribusinesses
1) Diversify your raw material sourcing, making use of alternatives available locally
2) Diversify sourcing of your raw materials and make use of alternatives that are readily available locally.
3) Leverage the value-based pricing method to cost your products and services
4) Consciously cut down on use of utility and fuel, i.e., electricity and water. Ensure your factory or agribusiness limits wastage. Start making investments in other forms of electricity generation like solar.
5) Track every transaction and keep appropriate records. Undertake periodic audits of your books and tax filings
6) If it is in your power, band together with other agribusinesses/agripreneurs to engage in “group import of raw materials” or group sourcing.
7) Leverage suitable technologies to minimise labour cost and extra expenditure
8) Maintain constant engagement with the various stakeholder groups and associations along the value chain in order to safeguard your interests.
9) Agribusinesses should make it a priority to diversify their sources of credit; thus, a combination of equity, debt, venture capital, and grant funding could make the responsibility of paying back short-term investments less burdensome.

The importance of trade secrets in the food and beverage industry [Article],"– An interview with Kojo Brifo, Freddy Hirsch WA MD, and Uduak Koka, Intellectual Property Expert and MD of Baesault
In this interview, Kojo Brifo, Managing Director of Freddy Hirsch Nigeria and West Africa and Uduak Koka, an Intellectual Property expert and Managing Director of Baesault, an intellectual property consultancy speak on trade secrets in the food and beverage industry, stressing the importance of IP.

Can you give us an overview of trade secrets, IP, and how this connects to the food and beverage industry?

The food and beverage industry is a highly competitive and dynamic industry that thrives on innovation and creativity. Globally, companies in this sector are constantly looking for ways to gain a competitive advantage, whether it is through new product development, marketing strategies, or operational efficiencies. One way that companies can gain an edge in this industry is by protecting their trade secrets.



Trade secrets are confidential information that is critical to the success of a business, such as customer lists, product formulations, manufacturing processes, and marketing strategies. Unlike patents or trademarks, which must be published as a trade-off for the monopoly of protection, trade secrets are kept confidential and can remain so indefinitely. In the food and beverage industry, trade secrets are particularly important, as the success of a company often depends on its ability to create unique and innovative products. Companies invest significant time and resources in research and development to create new recipes, formulations, and production processes. These trade secrets give companies a competitive advantage by allowing them to create products that are not easily replicated by competitors.

Can you explain trade secrets in more detail?

Trade secrets are the most prized crown jewels in any company. A trade secret is a type of intellectual property right that companies keep very close to their chest and do all they can to ensure the information remains secret. A more general definition of a trade secret is any information, unknown to its competitors that gives its owner an advantage over its competitors.
With such a broad definition, various types of information have the potential to fall within this category. For example, customer/ supplier lists, pricing strategies, manufacturing/production methods, formulations, data (both positive data and data from failed research) equipment, and the integration thereof – the list goes on. However, there is one caveat. For information to be considered as a trade secret in most legal systems, the owner (of the confidential information) must also make reasonable efforts to ensure that the information is kept confidential. We’ll explore what this means in practice later but the requirement of reasonable efforts to ensure the security of the information is understandable when you think about the value of trade secrets in certain industries. If a unique production process combined with a unique formulation of ingredients/materials form a part of a company’s core offering, the ability to keep that process and formulation (and various other aspects of their business) a secret is vital as it is their life blood.
This rings true for the food and beverage industry as well as most engineering, pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies. However, trade secrets are just as important for non-manufacturing companies like fintech, software, and a host of other industries too.
Many well-known food and beverage companies have enjoyed and continue to enjoy success because they have been able to maintain the secrecy of certain information over a period of time. If you have ever tried to recreate the flavors savored in a restaurant you once visited (or better yet, flavors created by the best cook you know) you’ll understand that figuring out the ingredients and the know-how i.e. the recipe to get something to taste exactly the same is no easy feat. I am yet to taste KFC flavors outside of KFC or a Coca-Cola imitation that matches the original. This is no surprise as those are two of the best-kept trade secrets in the food and beverage industry. The Coca-Cola recipe and KFC recipe have enjoyed protection for over 130 years and a little over 75 years respectively.
This is not to say that it would be impossible to independently figure out their recipes; however, it would take quite some resources for a company to do so. This is where time is your friend because in the time it is taking a competitor to research and develop a competitive product, your company has the space to build its reputation and generate goodwill for its brand such that your brand (or trademark(s)) whether registered or unregistered becomes so admired amongst its users that it doesn’t matter if someone brings out a similar product because you will have gained the trust and more importantly, the loyalty of consumers.

What are some types of trade secrets?

Trade secrets are not just important for product formulations, and commercial applications but also for manufacturing processes. Companies in the food and beverage industry may use specialized equipment or techniques to produce their products, which can give them a competitive advantage in terms of quality, efficiency, or cost. By keeping these processes confidential, companies can protect their trade secrets and maintain their competitive edge. Trade secrets play a crucial role in manufacturing, especially when it comes to production processes and recipes. Companies invest significant time and resources in developing efficient and effective production processes that give them a competitive advantage in terms of quality, cost, and speed. Similarly, as we discussed in relation to Coca-Cola and KFC, recipes for products can be trade secrets that provide a company with a unique product that cannot be easily imitated. By keeping these trade secrets confidential, companies can maintain their competitive edge and ensure their continued success in the manufacturing industry.
Business information trade secrets encompass a range of confidential information critical to the success of a business, including customer/client lists, supplier lists, price agreements, distribution methods, contractual conditions, and executed contracts. Customer and supplier lists are valuable trade secrets that can provide a company with a competitive edge by allowing it to establish and maintain important relationships. Sales methods, price agreements, and advertising strategies are also important trade secrets that can help a company differentiate itself from competitors and increase its market share. Distribution methods, contract forms, and business schedules are other examples of trade secrets that can give a company a competitive advantage by ensuring efficient operations and effective management.
In the food and Beverage industry, recipes, machinery, and processes are kept confidential as it serves as a competitive advantage and unique product differentiator. This is true, for example, in Nigeria. Dufil Group, the owners of the Indomie brand, an instant noodle product have a unique boiled chicken flavor that has made it a market leader in the noodle category. In the Bouillon seasoning category, leading brands like Unilever Knorr and Nestle’s Maggi have unique flavor profiles and create a distinct taste for consumers. The quick service restaurants continue to innovate and create new platforms and recipes to ensure a competitive edge over competitors, with, for instance, the fried rice sold at different restaurants; each with different tastes based on the fried note, the vegetables used, rice, and appearance.
Based on the advantages of trade secrets in the food and beverage industry, it is very key to protect recipes, process methods and food-related systems. This is where robust policies and procedures, such as confidentiality agreements, access controls, and security measures are essential to protecting these trade secrets from unauthorized access and ensuring a company’s continued success irrespective of the sector.

Besides customer loyalty and brand recognition, what are the impacts of trade secrets that may be less obvious?

While the impact of trade secrets on innovation and competitive advantage is well-known, there are also less obvious impacts that can have significant economic and national security implications.
An economic impact of trade secrets is that they can create barriers to entry in markets. When a company possesses a unique trade secret, it can be difficult for a new competitor to enter and compete effectively. This can lead to decreased competition, higher prices, and reduced innovation. For example, if a company has a secret formula for a product that cannot be easily reverse-engineered, as long as the trade secret remains a secret, the company can maintain a monopoly on that product, driving up prices for consumers. This may slow technological advancements as it discourages collaboration between companies.
Interestingly the US, Japan, and EU have recently made some updates to their trade secret policies of the last 5 years to, for example, expand protections and include civil and criminal remedies for trade secret theft. When you consider that theft of trade secrets accounts for about 3% of GDP in the global north, it is understandable why updates are being made.
Trade secrets can also have significant national security implications, when related to military technology, weapons systems, etc and are critical to national defence, or are critical infrastructure such as energy systems or telecommunications networks. If these trade secrets are compromised, it could lead to serious disruptions and potentially even pose a threat to public safety. It is thus important to strike a balance between protecting trade secrets and ensuring that information sharing and collaboration can continue to drive progress and innovation in critical industries.

What are some examples of companies that have managed trade secrets well?

The most widely known example is probably Coca-Cola, as it has successfully guarded its formula for over 130 years. A less spoken about, but also popular brand is the soy sauce manufacturer Kikkoman which has held its trade secrets for about 300 years. There’s also Lindt, the Swiss chocolatier which has been in operation since 1845, is present in over 100 countries and has managed to keep their recipes secret – they report keeping one or more of their recipes in a vault in Switzerland.

What does intellectual property mean to Freddy Hirsch Nigeria and what role has trade secrets played in its success?

Freddy Hirsch Nigeria is a flavor and seasoning manufacturer in Nigeria supplying FMCG. Freddy Hirsch works with multiple customers to deliver a unique and innovative flavor to them. Our propriety and confidential information are key assets This includes our flavor formulas and application technologies. As a flavor supplier to many customers, we make sure that each customer’s trade secret, manufacturing process, information, and sources of raw materials are not disclosed to any third party or customer competitors.
For a company like Freddy Hirsch Nigeria, intellectual property is critical to its success so we hold various patents, which give us a competitive advantage in the market. We also have trademarks on the brand name and logo, which helps to distinguish our products from those of our competitors.
By keeping these trade secrets secret, we can prevent their competitors from replicating our products or processes, which helps us to maintain a dominant market position.

How does Freddy Hirsch Nigeria ensure that its trade secrets are protected?

We have a code of Conduct, the values of which protect our intellectual property including our trade secrets.
Freddy Hirsch values and protects its confidential information, and we also respect other companies’ confidential information. Our client’s information is not shared with any of its competitors or other customers. We also ensure that any other information collected is done in an ethical and legal manner. Our employees sign non-disclosure agreements subject to Labour law that stipulates that any technologies developed and created while in the employment of the company is property of Freddy Hirsch Nigeria. It is our responsibility to ensure the proper handling of confidential information. We facilitate IP and trade secret courses during new employee inductions and have periodic reviews to reinforce and update new employees on trade secrets protection. We also have a trade secret policy that advises employees on how to identify and manage and protect trade secrets. Employees are advised not to leave confidential information computers, tablets, flash drives or mobile phones unattended.  In addition, access to software, confidential information is restricted and controlled.

Do you see any changes on the horizon for how we think about protecting IP or trade secrets specifically in the food and beverage industry?

The food and beverage industry, like any other industry, is constantly evolving, and as such, there will be changes in the way that companies protect their intellectual property (IP) or trade secrets. One trend that has emerged in recent years is the increasing use of technology to protect trade secrets across various industries and the food and beverage industry is no exception. For example, companies are starting to use blockchain technology to securely store and track information about their products, access records, and supply chain, thereby reducing the risk of theft or unauthorized access to trade secrets. Another trend is the growing importance of protecting data and information in the food and beverage industry. With the rise of digital technologies and the increasing amount of data generated by food and beverage companies, there is a need to protect sensitive information from theft or misuse.

Francis Timore Boi writes: All you need to know about tax on lottery and gambling,"The inclusion of lottery or gambling income as taxable income is strongly influenced by a country’s choice of tax system. For those countries with worldwide tax system, gambling winnings are in principle, subject to tax whether they arise from windfall (occasional transactions) or from a professional gambler.
When tax is imposed on gambling and lottery, the Tax Base is only on the winnings and the losses are ignored.
Losses incurred in gambling or lottery are not deductible because each gambling occasion is a separate event.  Gambling or lottery losses arising on one occasion cannot be deducted against winnings derived on another occasion.



These restrictions presumably reflect the administrative difficulties of verifying gambling losses. Even in the case of a professional gambler or lotto “staker”, losses for the year can be deducted only from the gambling income or winnings from the stake.
The Practice in some countries
Most countries tax lottery or gambling income as Occasional Income (windfall) and some countries consider gambling income as taxable only if the gambler can be found to be in the business of gambling. For example in Germany, gambling income of a professional card player is taxable as business income and gambling from TV shows is taxable as other income.
In Ghana, when Act 896 was passed in 2015, lottery activity was recognized as an investment activity. Since 2015, lottery taxation has gone through several changes leading to it being repealed.
In 2015 when Act 896, a withholding tax of 5% was imposed on the winning amount under 1st Schedule Par 8(1)(b)(viii).
In 2016, the Income Tax Amendment Act, 2016 (Act 907) amended it to exempt only the first GHS 2,592 and any excess wining above the GHS 2,592 was taxable at 5%.
In 2017: The National Lottery Authority (NLA) made a proposal to the Ministry of Finance for the scrapping of taxes as a way of attracting more mainstream operators. The tax was then repealed.
Regulations 24 of the Income Tax Regulations, 2016 (L.I 2244) defined winnings from lottery to include gambling, betting and any game of chance.
Does the exemption of Lottery in Ghana mean that a professional gambler (CASINO, lotto forecaster, etc), engaged in gabbling business (unregistered lotto forecaster) is also exempt?
It appears not. But the law in my view needs to be clarified or enforced. What about other forms of TV shows and promotional winnings?
2023 10% TAX ON LOTTERY WINNINGS
The gaming industry continues to grow.  From $70 billion in 2016 to $92 billion in 2022. With the use of technology, the industry is booming. In the 2023 budget, the government has reintroduced the tax at the rate of 10%. This time, there is no exemption as in the case of 2016. This 10% affects all forms of gaming, lottery and any game of chance.

Review of agricultural insurance in Ghana: Challenges and future directions [ARTICLE],"Africa has had extraordinary development in agricultural productivity and food security over the past few decades. These improvements have been essential in promoting economic growth.
Agriculture is a vital sector for many West African countries, contributing significantly to economies. The most favourable conditions for agricultural expansion in more than 30 years have been created by the convergence of strong demand growth, sustained economic growth, better global agriculture prices, and an improved policy environment.
The sector’s critical relevance for broad-based growth, food security, improved nutrition, and poverty reduction is now widely acknowledged by West African nations and their Development Partners. At the same time, the ability of West Africans to take advantage of these opportunities is threatened by a mix of both old and new problems, such as climate change and rising price volatility.



Also, it is also susceptible to various risks, including weather conditions, pests, and diseases. Farmers are, however, seriously threatened by pests and diseases, and climate change is further escalating the problem.
Farmers find it difficult, if not impossible, to pay back their loans when their crops or livestock fail. They are reluctant to use financial or technology resources in the upcoming season. It is usual for yields and revenue to again decline as a result. Agricultural insurance is an essential tool for farmers to mitigate these risks and ensure food security.
This op-ed provides an overview of agricultural insurance in West Africa, and Ghana; the main challenges facing the industry, and successful agricultural insurance programmes in Africa.
Overview of Agricultural Insurance in West Africa
Agricultural insurance is not widespread in West Africa, with less than 5% of farmers having access to agricultural insurance products. The sector is still unstable and mostly underdeveloped due to the inadequate, or rather non-existent, insurance products.
The vast majority of agricultural investments lack any sort of protection from climate dangers. According to a research released in September 2015 on the side-lines of the G20, only 450,000 (0.25%), of the 178 million farmers in developing nations that are insured by fund index insurance in 2014 are Africans. India and China are home to the large majority of people who have this type of insurance.
The low insurance coverage can be attributed to various factors such as a lack of insurance products, inadequate infrastructure, limited financial literacy, and high premiums. The available agricultural insurance products in West Africa include weather index insurance and traditional indemnity-based insurance.
Weather index insurance is based on weather parameters that determine the probability of crop loss, such as rainfall levels, temperature, and humidity. Traditional indemnity-based insurance compensates farmers for actual crop or livestock losses incurred. The choice of insurance product depends on the region’s weather patterns and farming practices.
Agricultural Insurance in Ghana
Agricultural insurance in Ghana is a relatively new concept, with the first agricultural insurance policy being introduced in the country in the late 1990s. The main aim of agricultural insurance in Ghana is to provide financial protection to farmers against crop failure due to natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and pests. This protection is intended to help farmers maintain their livelihoods and continue to produce crops and livestock, even in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Several private insurance companies already offer agricultural insurance in Ghana, and the government is also involved in encouraging and supporting the growth of the industry. The lack of awareness and knowledge of the concept among farmers is one of the major obstacles to the development of agricultural insurance in Ghana. Farmers may also be discouraged from purchasing insurance policies due to the high cost of insurance premiums and the restricted coverage provided by some of these insurance policies.
To address these challenges, the government of Ghana has implemented a number of measures to promote the development of agricultural insurance in the country. These include the establishment of a National Agriculture Insurance Policy, which aims to provide a framework for the development of agricultural insurance in Ghana and the creation of a National Agriculture Insurance Fund, which will provide financial support to farmers who have been affected by natural disasters.
The government also partnered with the World Bank and other international organisations to provide technical and financial support to the agricultural insurance sector. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of innovative technologies such as satellite imagery, drones, and mobile apps to improve the delivery of agricultural insurance in Ghana. These technologies can help to more accurately assess crop yields and damage, which can help to reduce the cost of insurance premiums for farmers.
Crop Insurance
Crop insurance in Ghana typically works by farmers purchasing an insurance policy from a private insurance company. The policy will specify the type of crop that is being insured and the coverage that is provided. For example, a policy may provide coverage for losses due to drought or flooding, but not for losses due to pests.
The farmer will pay a premium for the insurance coverage, and in the event of a loss due to a natural disaster, the farmer will make a claim for compensation. The SIC Insurance Company, Ghana National Insurance Company, and Star Assurance are a few of Ghana’s top crop insurance providers. These businesses often provide a variety of crop insurance policies that are specifically designed to satisfy the requirements of farmers in various parts of the nation.
The benefits of crop insurance in Ghana are numerous. Firstly, crop insurance provides financial protection to farmers against crop failure, which can help to maintain their livelihoods in the face of natural disasters. This is particularly important in Ghana, where agriculture is a major source of income for many people. Additionally, crop insurance can help to encourage farmers to invest in their farms, as they will have the security of knowing that their investments are protected against natural disasters.
However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed in order to make crop insurance more accessible to farmers in Ghana. One of the main challenges is the lack of awareness and understanding of the concept among farmers. Additionally, the high cost of insurance premiums and the limited coverage offered by some policies can also be a barrier to farmers taking on insurance policies.
Currently, crop insurance in Ghana is gaining prominence among key sector stakeholders as the country continues to face the impacts of climate change. With more frequent and severe weather events, crop insurance will play an increasingly important role in helping farmers to maintain their livelihoods in the face of natural disasters. Additionally, the use of innovative technologies such as satellite imagery, drones, and mobile apps will help to improve the delivery of crop insurance and make it more accessible to farmers in Ghana.
Livestock Insurance
Livestock insurance can be a critical investment for livestock farmers in Ghana, providing a safeguard against financial loss resulting from unexpected events such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters, or accidents. One of the key advantages of livestock insurance is the peace of mind it provides in the event of injury or death to the insured animals.
Livestock farmers in Ghana often rely on their animals for income and food, and losing them to unforeseen events can have a significant impact on their livelihoods. However, with livestock insurance, farmers can recover financially from such losses. The insurance policy can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the farmer, providing coverage for individual animals or an entire herd. Another merit of livestock insurance is its cost-effectiveness, as it allows farmers to protect their investment without incurring significant expenses. In the event of an unexpected loss, the payout from the insurance policy can cover the cost of replacing the lost animal or herd, minimising financial damage to the farmer.
Additionally, some insurance policies may offer a seamless claims process, allowing farmers to report and process their claims quickly and efficiently. The willingness of farmers to pay for livestock insurance is an indication of its value as an investment. A study conducted in the Northern Region of Ghana found that farmers were willing to pay for cattle insurance, indicating that they recognise the potential benefits of livestock insurance.
While there are benefits to livestock insurance, it is important to note that there may be drawbacks as well. For example, some insurance policies may have limitations on the types of events covered, and farmers may need to carefully review the terms and conditions of their policy to ensure adequate coverage. Additionally, insurance premiums may be relatively high, and farmers may need to weigh the potential benefits of livestock insurance against the cost of the policy.
Thus, livestock insurance can be a valuable investment for farmers in Ghana, providing financial protection against unexpected events and minimising the impact of losses on their livelihoods. With careful consideration of the terms and conditions of insurance policies, farmers can tailor their coverage to meet their specific needs and protect their investments in livestock. Successful agricultural insurance programmes in Africa demonstrate the potential of insurance in improving food security and livelihoods. Addressing the challenges requires concerted efforts from the government, private sector, and development partners to create an enabling environment for agricultural insurance to thrive in West Africa.
Successful Agricultural Insurance Cases
Several successful agricultural insurance programmes in Africa have shown how the insurance industry can boost food security and livelihoods. For example, in Kenya, assistance to farmers constituted a continuous drain on the national budget. It is estimated that the terrible drought that occurred from 2008-2011 had a total economic impact of $12 billion, which is equivalent to around 11% of GDP in 2011.
The government adopted a National Disaster Risk Financing Plan, which includes provisions for an agriculture insurance programme that is administered by the private sector and specifically targets farmers who are vulnerable to natural disasters. Farmers purchase the insurance as part of a bundled package along with other inputs of a high grade. If the rains do not set in as expected, the insurance will reimburse them for their financial losses in exchange for the premium.
They obtain bumper yields whenever the rainfall is favourable. Payouts are made available using mobile money, which not only improves the efficiency and openness of the help provided for relief efforts, but also encourages financial inclusion by offering access to savings accounts.
Over a half a million farmers are now insured by the programme, which not only increases the financial resilience of the farmers and relevant value chains prone to shocks, but also protects the government from budget volatility by transferring some of the risk to private markets. Currently, the programme protects over a million farmers in Kenya.
Again, the One Million Farmers Platform in Kenya has utilised disruptive innovations to offer affordable weather index insurance to over 70,000 farmers across 15 counties. Similarly, Gender and Inclusive Agricultural Insurance Solutions (GAIINS) in Kenya offers gender-sensitive agricultural insurance products that cater to the needs of women farmers affected by climate change. Another example is the African Risk Capacity (ARC) insurance programme, which provides African countries with parametric insurance products to cover losses associated with natural disasters. Both the government of Kenya and the government of India have provided assistance for the collection of data in order to design insurance products. Additionally, the governments of these two countries have provided premium co-financing in order to reduce the amount of money that farmers are required to pay and to encourage insurance companies to provide more coverage.
Challenges Facing Agricultural Insurance in West Africa
One of the main challenges facing agricultural insurance in West Africa is the lack of awareness and knowledge of insurance among farmers. Additionally, the low insurance penetration is attributed to high premiums and the unavailability of suitable insurance products that meet farmers’ needs. Another challenge is the limited financial infrastructure and weak regulatory frameworks that discourage private sector investment in the agricultural insurance sub-sector.
Concluding remarks
Agricultural insurance in Ghana is an important tool for helping farmers to maintain their livelihoods in the face of natural disasters. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in order to make agricultural insurance more accessible to farmers.
Government policies, technical and financial support from international organisations, and innovative technologies can help to support the development of agricultural insurance in Ghana. The future of agricultural insurance in Ghana is likely to be shaped by the increasing impacts of climate change and the use of new technologies, which can help to improve the delivery of agricultural insurance and make it more accessible to farmers.

"Getting more women of relevance in the film, television and media industry","From the earliest days of computing to the present age of virtual reality and artificial intelligence, women have made untold contributions to the digital world in which we increasingly live. Their accomplishments have been against all odds, in a field that has historically neither welcomed nor appreciated them.
Today, a persistent gender gap in digital access keeps women from unlocking technology’s full potential. Their underrepresentation in STEM education and careers remains a major barrier to their participation in tech design and governance. In addition, the pervasive threat of online gender-based violence—coupled with a lack of legal
recourse—too often forces them out of the digital spaces they do occupy.
At the same time, digital technology is opening new doors for the global empowerment of women, girls and other marginalized groups. From gender-responsive digital learning to tech-facilitated sexual and reproductive healthcare, the digital age represents an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate all forms of disparity and inequality.



Wednesday 8 th  March 2023 is International Women’s Day, celebrated annually as a focal point in the women&#39;s rights movement, bringing attention to issues such as gender equality, reproductive rights, and violence and abuse against women.
This year’s celebration is under the theme Digit-ALL: Innovation and technology for gender
equality.
As a Creative Writer and an expert in Multimedia Production, I wish to focus my attention on beating the gender gap in the industry – television and film. A major question I ask industry mates and fellow female colleagues – where do women stand in the film, television and media industry and what pragmatic steps are we taking to
close the gender gap?
According to the  Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University , nine percent (9%) of all narrative film directors are women. It is interesting to know that, it is usually the case that directors get to choose their team for their productions. In that case, the cast and crew often mirror who is in that top job.
So what works to change gender diversity? Hire women, it is as simple as that! That appears very simple, however, there are more layers to this problem beyond getting women in the door, including hostile work environments and too many assumptions made about the expectations of women in their career. The solution to the problem begins when you have more women in the room.
There is an assumption of incapability when it comes to women, as opposed to the assumption of capability when it comes to men. This definitely cannot be the case and in recent times, there has been some good news for women when we look at the new streaming content providers like Netflix and Amazon. Women have more
leading and prominent  roles and for their show, they are regular appearing characters versus traditional film and network television.
Financing is a big challenge for filmmakers and studies have shown that when men and women win at festivals, the male directors get tapped for big-budget studio films, while the female directors do not. To close this gap, we need several organizations to jump into the fray, to help to fund women-directed and produced projects just like
in other sectors such as agriculture, trade and others.
Getting stories financed that include interesting roles for women is another challenge and that should be taken into consideration. In addition, there should be affirmative action to create funding to assist women in the industry to build their capacities and add value to themselves in order to achieve some progress and more knowledge.
On a personal level, I will urge people involved in professional events in our industry to book as many women for their panels as men.  I can assure them of some fantastic and capable women who will deliver magnificently; they are out here and ready to speak. In addition, shining a light on the gender gap on and behind the screen is one way to keep the pressure on the industry. As the saying goes, what gets measured gets done!

Understanding the time value of money in the face of economic recession [ARTICLE],"The time value of money concept is a fundamental principle in finance that refers to the idea that the value of money changes over time due to factors such as inflation and interest rates. In other words, a dollar today is worth more than the same dollar in the future because the purchasing power of money decreases over time.
Therefore, understanding the time value of money is essential in making informed financial decisions. In this op-ed, we will explore the concept of the time value of money, and its significance, and provide specific examples to illustrate its application.
The time value of money is calculated using the formula; FV = PV × (1 + R) * T. Here, FV represents the future value of the investment, PV is the present value of the investment, 1 is a constant, R is the interest rate, and T is the number of years. This formula enables us to determine the value of an investment in the future based on the present value of the investment and the expected interest rate. One example of the application of the time value of money is in retirement planning.



Suppose an individual wants to retire in 20 years and wants to have $1 million in savings at retirement, assuming an interest rate of 5%, the individual would need to save approximately $376,889 in today’s dollars to reach their goal. Without considering the time value of money, the individual may underestimate the amount of savings needed to reach their retirement goal. This example illustrates how understanding the time value of money can help individuals make informed financial decisions.
Another example is the use of present value in investment decision-making. Suppose an investor is considering two investment options with different returns. Investment A returns $10,000 in five years, while Investment B returns $15,000 in ten years.
If we assume a discount rate of 5%, we can calculate the present value of each investment. The present value of investment A is $7,791, while the present value of investment B is $9,082. The outcomes of the above present values from both investment options, better inform the investor on the amount of money they want to commit now to yield an expected return in the future.
It is based on the above financial principles that employees, self-employed persons, or any other investment-driven person puts a percentage of their earnings in an investment/pension fund; for instance, monthly SSNIT contributions to enable them to have some amount of savings when they go on retirement. Retirement means you have taken a break from working, but does not mean your expenditures have equally taken a break. People make investment decisions when they are working so that on retirement, they can continue to cater to their needs.
The Government of Ghana on December 5, 2022, launched a Domestic Debt Exchange programme (DDE) to put the country’s debt on a sustainable path and also to meet the conditions for an IMF bailout. As part of the programme, an invitation was extended to domestic bondholders as of December 1, 2022, to voluntarily exchange their bonds for four new sets of bonds maturing in 2027, 2029, 2032, and 2037.
Approximately, GHS137 billion of the domestic notes issued by the government need to be exchanged, including Daakye and Energy Sector Levy Act (ESLA) bonds for a new set of bonds issued by the Government of Ghana. The exchange however excludes all Treasury Bills, bonds, and, notes held by individuals (natural persons).
After the impact assessment by the Finance Ministry, banks, specialised deposit-taking institutions (SDIs), insurance firms, collective investment schemes, pension fund trustees, asset managers, and regulated pension schemes were asked to participate in the debt exchange programme.
What this means is, though individual bondholders are exempted, individuals on the other hand have group investments with these institutions mentioned above will be required to accept some haircuts on their investments in one way or another.
It is common knowledge that some pensioners put their lump sums received from their pension funds in treasury bills and bonds and leave off the interest payments and coupons received from such investments. For instance, a pensioner who is now 70 years is being asked to come and exchange his/her bond for another bond maturing in 2037.
What is the probability that, this pensioner will be alive by 2037 to receive their investments when they finally mature? The other issue worth noting is the time value of money. The bondholders’ investment today will be worth less than the money they will be receiving in the future, as a consequence of inflation and exchange rate volatility.
Will the government factor in inflation in the new interest rate on the new bonds, to make out for the fall in value in the future? The parliament of Ghana is currently working to pass a resolution to exempt pension funds from the debt exchange programme even though the Minister of Finance said it was exempt. Currently a slippery slope, and an unconcluded matter at that.
In conclusion, the time value of money is a fundamental concept in finance and an important principle that helps investors make practical and sound financial decisions. In financial management, we understand there is an element of risk in every investment decision.
Even though government bonds and Treasury Bills are supposed to be risk-free, these times have taught us that, you cannot eliminate entirely the element of risks when making an investment decision. By embracing the risk element in making investments, and understanding the time value of money, one should be conscious to diversify their investment portfolios in order to limit or eliminate the various risks that come with investing.

Pensions in payment projected to go up by at least 20% in 2023  ACRR [ARTICLE],"January is the most important time of the year for pensioners and their dependents, primarily because it is when the Social Security Administration announces the new rates by which monthly pensions of existing retirees will be increased.
The import of indexation is to restore the purchasing power lost by pensioners in the previous year. Pensions in payment are therefore reviewed by applying an inflation-adjusted index. It is therefore expected that SSNIT in consultation with the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) will soon announce the new pension indexation rate for 2023.
How is the Pension Indexation Provision Applied by SSNIT?



Pension indexation (as provided in section 80 of Act 766), as a means of restoring the purchasing power lost by pensioners in the previous year, is largely dependent on the price inflation index.
In practice, SSNIT uses consumer price inflation as the main variable for increasing pensions. The Trust, in consultation with the Board of the National Pensions Regulatory Authority, agrees on what is termed as the
‘Overall Rate’ by which pensions will increase for the coming year. The overall indexation rate is based on the analysis of several variables which include in particular the projected increase in the cost of benefits for a given rate, and the resulting impact of the proposed indexation rate on the fund (fund ratios).
Given the Agreed ‘Overall Indexation Rate’, the ‘Fixed Rate’, which is equivalent to the Annual Average Price Inflation Rate of the previous year, and the ‘Flat Amount’ are determined.
EXPECTED INDEXATION RATE OF 2023
Likely Fixed Rate of Increase
As required by the Social Security Act, the Trust awards a fixed rate of increase for each pensioner based on average price inflation. In 2021, the consumer price inflation averaged 9.68% and therefore pensions were increased by a fixed rate of 9.68% in January 2022. In 2022, global economic challenges have eroded the purchasing power of pensioners due to rising prices of goods and services as measured by inflation.
The consumer price inflation averaged 29.40%. If SSNIT sticks to the provisions and practice (spanning from 1992), each pensioner on the pension payroll as at 31st December 2022 could see a commensurate monthly increase rate of 29%.
This level of indexation (29% fixed rate) could however expose the scheme to serious financial sustainability challenges (high inflationary risk). The Trust may apply a scheme sustainability adjustment factor (SSAF) in this year’s indexation. The scheme sustainability adjustment factor essentially ensures that the awarded Fixed Rate of increment is lower than the actual average inflation rate of the previous year.
It is there expected that SSNIT might increase pensions by a fixed rate ranging between 20% to 25% in January 2023.
In 2023, and from a policy perspective, if pensions would be increased at a rate lower than the annual average price inflation (29%), it is expected that the Trust will clearly explain or communicate the reasons for changes in the basis of indexation to stakeholders, especially contributors and pensioners.
The Minimum Pension Amount Must be Reviewed Upward in 2023
Both the Social Security Law, 1991, (PNDCL 247) and the National Pension Act, 2008, Act 766 have provided for the payment of minimum pension to poor pensioners (poverty relief).
To practically sustain the economic welfare of pensioners, the minimum pension, which has stayed at GH300.00 for four successive years (2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022) needs to be reviewed significantly upward in 2023.
Note that the minimum pension of GHS300.00 represents 30 dollars (using the current exchange rate) per month. This pension amount represents 50% of the value of the national poverty line.
Trend analysis shows that the minimum pension had consistently increased each year since 2000, and in some cases doubled (2013 and 2014). For the period 2016 to 2021, the minimum pension grew by only 9% whilst the minimum salary of active contributors increased by 47.75% within the period.
If the level of benefits provided by social protection systems is insufficient in terms of minimum living standards, or are not deliberately designed to protect the poor, and to minimize the social and economic inequalities between the rich and the poor the effort to reduce old age poverty will be jeopardized.

Tomato: Ghanas Unexplored Goldmine,"Tomatoes, in their numerous forms, are a globally famed staple crop with countless regional variants. Currently ranked 319th on the list of the world’s most traded products in 2022, it is one of the most studied commercial vegetable and greenhouse crops in the world. It is estimated that annual worldwide tomato production is 180,766,329 metric tonnes valued at $9.81 billion (https://atlasbig.com).
China produces more than 35% of the world’s tomatoes, equivalent to more than 62 million tonnes. India, Turkey, the United States, and Egypt take second through fifth place, producing a combined total volume of 49,459,836 metric tonnes, representing 27.4% of global output.
Tomatoes are grown on a total of 1,246,524 hectares of land in these four countries, while China grows enough tomatoes to sustainably feed its own people on just 1,086,771 hectares. Do you see the efficiency and productivity? However, fresh tomato exports around the world are very diverse.



Over 187 million metric tonnes of tomatoes were harvested in 2020, with an estimated 3.51 million tonnes shipped abroad. In terms of fresh tomato exports, Mexico is by far the leader, with almost 1.8 million metric tonnes worth $2.62 billion. A report indicates that the top five countries, the Netherlands ($1.82B), Spain ($1.1B), Morocco ($852M), and Canada ($448M) earn hugely from exporting fresh tomatoes (https://tomatonews.com/).
As of 2022, the United States will have imported $2.9 billion worth of fresh tomatoes, making it the highest importer in the world. Other topmost tomato importing countries globally are Germany ($1.7 billion), France ($816.5 million), United Kingdom ($622.9 million), and Russia ($398.5 million), respectively (https://tridge.com/). However, the global production of tomatoes drastically dropped as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which subsequently impacted pricing of fresh and paste tomatoes in local markets across the globe. Despite these obstacles, global output is on the upswing and likely to continue expanding (https://www.gefmarket.com/post/tomato-production-across-the-world).
Current Trends of Tomato Market in Ghana
Approximately, 300,000 metric tonnes of tomatoes are grown in Ghana annually, with 90% consumed domestically. Three eighths of all vegetable spending in Ghana goes toward the ubiquitous tomato due to its central role in local Ghanaian cuisines. The Roma VF, Laurano, Raki, Chocó TP, Power Rano, Rasta, Italy Heinz, Cherry and Petomech cultivars are among the most widely planted in Ghana because of their suitability for processing into tomato paste.
Tomatoes are a fixture in every Ghanaian household, hotel, and restaurant, driving daily demand for tomato products in every region of the country. Consumers in Ghana have developed an insatiable hunger for convenience foods due to the country’s expanding middle class and growing urban population; thus, driving a rise in the demand for tomato paste, which is utilised in the cooking of many different cuisines in Ghana.
The growing demand for tomato pastes in Ghana eventually translate into a sizable market for locally-processed tomatoes. Unfortunately, Ghana’s tomato processing industry is still quite modest, and the country relies significantly on imports to meet demand. Over 100 million dollars’ worth of tomato paste is used annually in Ghana; that’s more than 1000 metric tonnes.
The majority of Ghana’s tomato production happens in nine of the country’s 16 regions. The Upper East, Northern, Brong East, Ahafo, Bono, Ashanti, Eastern, Greater Accra, and Volta regions are the notable production regions. There are approximately 11,728 farmers involved in tomato production in these major tomato growing regions of Ghana.
Tomato processing directly benefits an estimated 58,640 people (Trade Aid Integrated, 2021). The Ghana National Tomato Producers’ Federation estimates that the country’s annual tomato output is 510,000 metric tonnes, the country imports between 7,000 and 12,000 metric tonnes of tomatoes from Burkina Faso and 27,000 metric tonnes of processed tomatoes from Europe. Ghana possesses one of the largest agricultural dams in West Africa, as well as favourable topographical and agro-ecological characteristics (the Tano Dam, situated in a tomato farming region, can be used to produce tomato all year round).
The overwhelming importation of tomato paste into Ghana can be attributed to the shortage and high price of tomato during the dry and minor seasons. About 321,000 metric tonnes of tomatoes are grown yearly at a value of USD 118 million, with another 75,000 metric tonnes imported to make up the difference.
Moreover, during significant rainy seasons, farmers continue to face gluts and high post-harvest losses. About 30% of Ghana’s annual output of more than 510,000 metric tons of fresh tomatoes is lost every year due to spoilage.
Tomato processing in Ghana
The government of Ghana established two tomato processing plants, TOMACAN and Pwalugu Tomato Processing factories, in the early 1960s. Robinson and Kolavalli (2010) reported that the combined upshots of structural reforms advocated by the World Bank and the IMF, frequent breakdowns due to a lack of spare parts and obsolete machinery, incompetent financial management, weak marketing, and a lack of technical expertise led to the shutting down of both factories in the 1980s. Since then, the government of Ghana has tried multiple times to transform these facilities into commercial-scale tomato processing plants.
As part of the 1D1F initiative, Ghana hoped to entice industrial-scale tomato processors to set up commercial processing factories in Ghana. As part of a public-private partnership (PPP) with the government of Ghana and with funding assistance of GHS 200,000 from the Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund, the agro-processing firm Techiman Processing Complex built a tomato processing factory in 2014.
Production at the plant had been stalled for some time due to a lack of necessary inputs. TEPCO is reportedly still trying to secure additional funding for its operations.
The FAO estimates that Ghana’s processing capacity for fresh tomatoes per day is 1,400 metric tonnes (500 tonnes at Trusty Foods and Northern Star, 200 tonnes at Afrique Link Ltd in Wenchi and TEPCO in Techiman). Even at full capacity, these three tomato processors would only be able to process 438,000 metric tonnes of fresh tomato into 54,750 metric tonnes of tomato paste annually (assuming a paste of 36-38% brix, requiring 8 metric tonnes of fresh tomato per tonne of paste), leaving Ghana with a shortfall in its supply of tomato paste despite the country’s high demand (in excess of 100,000 tonnes a year).
Any business that generates income from manufacturing or agricultural production and exports some or all of that produce is eligible for a corporate tax rebate of 40%-75%. To further reduce the cost of going global, exporters can claim a drawback of up to 100% of the tariffs paid on imported raw materials through a Custom Duty Drawback. Profits, Dividends, and Capital Mobility Guaranteed unconditional transferability in freely convertible currency of dividends or net profits attributable to investment in the enterprise shall be made through an authorised dealer bank, subject to the Foreign Exchange Act, 2006 (Act 723) and the regulations and notices issued under the Foreign Exchange Act. This paves the way for a complete repatriation of profits in the investment.
Ghana’s One District, One Factory Initiative
The policy is framed by Ghana’s overarching strategic goal of becoming a full middle-income, top-tier agro-industrial powerhouse in Africa. The strategy lays out specific and understandable instructions for executing the government’s domestic and foreign trade goals. To take advantage of export market prospects via AfCFTA and meet domestic market requirements, the government’s trade policy, as outlined in the sectoral growth of the agro-processing industry, requires the expansion and diversification of production of goods and services. It also stresses the importance of agriculture to Ghana’s economy and the role that agro-processing would play in the country’s efforts to diversify its economy. Due to the high cost of production and sometimes limited access to credit, farmers in Ghana are forced to sell fresh tomatoes for a profit, rather than to local tomato processors. This in turn makes it difficult for local tomato processors to compete with imported tomato paste, which is cheaper. During the peak season, when the processor price is higher than the fresh market price, farmers typically supply tomato factories; however, as the dry season approaches, farmers begin to shift their focus to the fresh market as tomatoes become increasingly scarce. In Ghana, locally-produced tomato paste is more affordable than imported tomato paste.
There are multiple brands of tomato paste available in Ghana, with the majority of these brands coming from either Europe or China. Notable manufacturers of tomato paste include: Conserveria Africana, producers of Gino and Pomo tomato paste; Olam produces Tasty Tom; Trusty Foods produces La Bianca tomato paste; and Centro Esportazione Conservati imports Salsa from Italy.
There are currently over 78,000 metric tonnes of tomato paste imported annually, and 12,000 metric tonnes exported after repackaging. The 210-gram tin of tomato paste is the best seller in Ghana’s retail tomato paste market. Interestingly, in the Ghanaian market, the most expensive tomato paste product is imported from Italy, Salsa, while the least priced is La Bianca, which is produced by Northern Star and packaged for sale by Trusty Foods locally.
Prices of tomato paste in Ghana have soared recently as cost of import have reached an all-time high, making foreign brands more expensive than Ghanaian ones. This means that the additional cost of paying above-market prices for Ghanaian-produced tomato paste is less than the additional cost of importing tomato paste into the country, allowing the locally-processed tomato to maintain a gross margin sufficient to cover the cost of inputs and at a reasonable profit.
Rising domestic demand for tomato
The rising middle class is a large market for locally-processed tomatoes. However, high-value food imports have been on the rise as domestic food processing capacities remain insufficient to meet consumer demand. In a recent joint agricultural sector review forum in Accra, data on tomato production in Ghana indicates a positive productivity gain in local tomato production from 2018-2021 (MoFA, 2022). As result of the high cost of imported tomato paste, Italy is one of Ghana’s top suppliers, thus Ghana is the eighth-largest buyer of Italian tomato paste.
The Vegetable Producers and Exporters Association of Ghana (Ghana Vegetables) reports that tomato imports from Burkina Faso have reached US$400 million annually from US$99.5 million in 2018. To meet its 800,000 metric tonnes tomato consumption, Ghana imports 90% of fresh tomatoes from Burkina Faso.
This is attributed to higher imports and decreased domestic production as a direct consequence of high cost of inputs, low-quality seeds, lack of mechanisation and machinery. Ghana Vegetables is increasing production and supply by 40% to keep at least half of the money in the country.
Ghana Vegetables reports that over 70% of Ghana’s shopping malls and shopping centres sell tomatoes from the Netherlands, Burkina Faso, and other countries (https://lnkd.in/dNwV3YhU). Any investment into local tomato processing will help local farmers and their communities improve their livelihoods, improve their farming practices and offer farmers competitive, guaranteed minimum prices through contracts.

Which investment is best for you in the Ghanaian Financial Markets? [ARTICLE],"Investments are generally motivated by the desire for profit; each investor aims to use his money profitably to generate significant returns. As a result, investors may decide to put their money into one or more of the available investment classes which include bonds, stocks, cash equivalents, real estate, various commodities, etc.
Bonds, stocks, and cash equivalents are the three traditional investment classes. All other investment classes fall under the category of alternative investment classes. Each class comes with its own risks and benefits, advantages.
The main advantage of investing in the three traditional classes is the lower initial investments amounts, that is, how much money you may want to begin with.



For instance, investing in real estate frequently necessitates that the investor makes a sizable one-time payment (as real estate properties may be quite expensive).
It is however easy for investors to purchase a modest number of inexpensive shares or bonds that have a good potential for growth in a single transaction, meaning, investors can buy these assets with a smaller sum of money.
Secondly, compared to some other investment classes, the three main investment classes frequently provide liquidity (ready market) for trades to be executed, whether buying or selling. There is a sure availability of Bonds and stocks available to invest in on a regular basis.
Typically, the well-organized and controlled markets have a very high volume of daily transactions due to the high popularity of these investment classes and safety among investors. Investors in these asset classes can swiftly recoup their investment costs by liquidating their holdings. In contrast, the owner of a piece of real estate would have to wait several months before finding a buyer if they wish to sell the property and receive their money back.
There is transparency in the dealing with the traditional asset classes of investments. Information on trading activities is always available online and on demand. Investors are also at liberty to quote their “fair” prices for trades to be executed. Investors can therefore quickly (and accurately) ascertain the market price of any asset traded in these exchanges.
This makes it possible for investors to decide on investments with maximum information. In contrast, it might not always be possible to determine the precise price at which the previous transaction in a specific location was completed if we look at the real estate market. As a result, determining the precise market worth of one’s real estate holdings may be challenging. Consequently, such an investor can occasionally wind up selling his piece of property for less than its market value (thereby losing potential profits).
Due to the benefits mentioned above, many investors favour the three primary investment classes over the alternative investment classes when choosing where to put their money.
In finding out which investment is more suitable for you follow the process below.
1. Speak to a professional
Visit an investment firm where a professional will attend to you. The Securities and Exchange Commission website provides a list of investment firms that can attend to your needs. NIMED Capital Limited provides a good option.
2. Risk Assessment profiling.
The professional, in this case, the professional at NIMED Capital Ltd, is expected to take you through a risk assessment profiling. This will inform you which investment asset to select for you. As stated earlier in this write-up, the various assets come with their risks.
3. Explanation of the Investment Classes
The professional will take time to explain the available investment classes to you. Normally, investors are supposed to look out for information about how the assets have performed in the immediate past, the current value and information on what the future holds (trend analysis, intrinsic value and future projections).
These steps are expected to give the investor a fair idea of which investment asset to invest in. The professional is expected to make a recommendation and the investor has the right to accept or reject it.
The table below shows the trends of trades that have occurred in the fixed-income market as well as the stock market.


 
 

 
The trends show that the fixed-income market has recorded higher trades than the stock market.
Generally, investors are risk-averse, and the fixed-income market provides a good avenue for fixed returns for investors. Indeed, fixed income provides steady returns over a long period.
However, the stock market also provides an option for higher returns because of the high risks. In the last report where Young Investors Research/NIMED Capital Research Team produced detailed information about the performance of the Financial Stock Index, we pointed out some of the areas that can be looked at.
“Never invest in a business you cannot understand”, Warren Buffet once said. Whatever investment is introduced to you as an investor, ensure you understand the asset thoroughly before funds are committed to it. The Stock Pitch Competition is being organized by the Young Investors Network for tertiary education students to train them to select the right assets for investment purposes.
