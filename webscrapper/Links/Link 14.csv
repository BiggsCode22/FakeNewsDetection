"Health effects of tobacco and alcohol consumption alarming, intervention needed  Dean","Professor Sam Newton, Dean of the School of Public Health at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, says the statistics on the effects of tobacco and alcohol consumption are frightening and should not be ignored by the government.

""Every intervention designed to reduce the consumption of these harmful products, even if that means raising taxes on them, should be applauded.

""It has been said that there are two things in life which are certain: death and taxes. Therefore, if raising taxes on a harmful product can delay the onset of death, then this should be seen as a progressive step,"" he stated.

Prof. Newton made the remark when the Vision for Alternative Development  Ghana (VALD-Ghana) organized the maiden National Forum on Tobacco Taxation in Accra.

The forum aimed to seek feasible recommendations through which Ghanas tobacco taxation could be comprehensively aligned with global standards, particularly those outlined by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.",,Health, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Health-effects-of-tobacco-and-alcohol-consumption-alarming-intervention-needed-Dean-1937991
"Lack of exercise, potbellies fueling high blood pressure among youth","A medical professional in the Upper East Region, Luis Tidan, has stated that lifestyle choices, such as lack of exercise, poor dietary choices, and failure to seek early medical attention, are fueling a high rate of high blood pressure in the region, especially among the youth.

He explained that even though older persons are more likely to develop high blood pressure, the youth have become predisposed to it due to poor lifestyle choices and health-seeking behavior.

He advised residents of the region to have regular medical check-ups to enable the detection and treatment of ailments and diseases.

""With the aged, research has shown that we are prone to getting hypertension as we grow older. And even with the youth, most of us are roaming with potbellies, not exercising much, and we are recording very high cases of hypertension among the youth.

For these cases, get yourself checked. If you can, get yourself checked every week, or at least every month. Weight check and management are important, and when it comes to diet, the intake of salt and fats should be reduced, and exercise is a major part of it,"" Mr. Tidan advised after leading a team of medical professionals to conduct health screening exercises in the Vea and Soe-Yipaala communities in the Upper East Region.

The health screening exercises, undertaken by the Bolgatanga Health Directorate, were sponsored by Christ Church Ministries and Real Life Ministries.",,Health, 30 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Lack-of-exercise-potbellies-fueling-high-blood-pressure-among-youth-1937986
HIV: More babies getting infected despite PMTCT intervention,"The National Aids Control Programme (NACP) says there is an increase in HIV mother-to-child infections despite the implementation of the Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT).

Dr Stephen Ayisi-Addo, Programme Manager of the National Aids Control Programme (NACP), said the situation was due to a lack of testing and adherence to medication by pregnant women, hence the continuous infection from mothers to their babies.

At the 2023 dissemination of National HIV estimates, Dr Ayisi-Addo expressed concern that facilities continue to record newborn babies infected with the virus, which is a transmission from the mother to the baby.

The Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT) is one of the interventions instituted by NACP, Ghana Aids Commission (GAC), and partners to ensure the prevention of HIV transmission from mothers to their babies.

With the intervention, pregnant women would have to get tested for HIV at Antenatal care service and those found positive would be put on medication to protect the baby from getting infected.

The National HIV estimation showed that 12,108 mothers, aged 15 to 49 years, are receiving Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT) treatment.

It also indicated that 13,445 mothers needed PMTCT between the ages of 15 to 49 years.

He noted that many of the babies contracting HIV from their mothers were babies from mothers who missed testing during ANC, saying, ""We are talking about covering about 90 per cent of all ANC attendance for HIV testing, so those who come in late do not get the treatment to prevent the mother from transmitting to the baby.

""We need to be able to improve the ANC testing coverage. We need to improve so that people will have supervised delivery on the routine services offered when pregnant women come to the facility,"" he added.

The Programme Manager also indicated that a lack of adherence to taking their medication by HIV-infected mothers was causing transmission from mothers to their newborns.

He said even with those tested and identified, not all of them get the antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

Besides, out of about 6,000 PMTCT facilities, just 730 are delivering ARV.

Dr Ayisi-Addo said at facilities where there was no PMTCT coverage, pregnant women would have to be transferred to other facilities for such services, but they refuse to go due to transportation issues, hence the new strategy to decentralise antiretroviral therapy across all centres.

He said postnatal transmission was also occurring due to exposure to breastfeeding.

As part of the interventions, the national response programme had instituted strict infant feeding guidelines for HIV-positive mothers to prevent transmission.

However, some mothers are unable to adhere to the guidelines, and such gaps are contributing to the continuous records of transmission.

The programme manager acknowledged that the infant feeding guidelines for persons living with HIV had been reduced due to the unavailability of trained service providers to educate the mothers as they missed the appropriate feeding procedure, getting their babies exposed to the virus.

""It is our aspiration and determination to make sure that we address all these issues and improve on strategic interventions to improve the figures and reduce mother-to-child transmission to at least 2 per cent, which is an elimination target.""

Dr Stephen Atuahene, Director General of the GAC, said strict adherence to treatment was key as it suppressed the virus and would help to avoid perinatal transmission.

He said it was important for HIV-positive women to achieve viral suppression before getting pregnant and necessary to maintain the suppression status, saying, ""It is also the responsibility of the mother to adhere to treatment, maintain viral suppression status, and avoid transmission.

""As long as you can do that, you have a better chance of averting transmission to your baby, and so adherence is very crucial to all persons living with HIV and taking the medication. This is so important for mothers because every woman will want to have a healthy baby and therefore you have to avoid any risk that will expose your child to infection.""",,Health, 29 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/HIV-More-babies-getting-infected-despite-PMTCT-intervention-1937967
Narcotics Control Commission warns children against the use of illegal drugs,"The Volta Regional Narcotics Control Commission has taken this year's International Day Against Drug Abuse to the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) Basic School in Ho.

 The Commission and the Volta Regional Police Command observed the day with pupils from UHAS Basic School and other public basic schools in the Ho municipality.

 The pupils were educated on drug abuse, its impact on health, and how to desist from its use.

 Addressing the children, the Regional Commander of the Narcotics Control Commission, Worlanyo Fianu, said, ""Cannabis is increasingly being integrated into consumable food products like candies (popularly known as wee toffees), food, and drinks, a situation that makes it difficult for parents, teachers, and law enforcement to detect its use among teenagers, hence making efforts to prevent drug use among young people more difficult.""

 ""Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, and cannabis use can interfere with this process, potentially leading to long-term cognitive issues. Teenagers who start using cannabis are more likely to experiment with more dangerous substances, making cannabis a gateway drug,"" he added.

 Melody Domoti, an officer from the Narcotics Control Commission, urged the pupils to desist from the use of illegal drugs and to resort to drugs prescribed by medical practitioners only for the treatment of illnesses.

 On his part, the Headmaster of UHAS Basic, Seth Korgah, reiterated that drug abuse is alarming, hence the need to observe this year's day against drug abuse with children, citing the importance of young people in nation-building.

 He said campus-based clubs will be established in basic schools to ""form panels to discuss issues about drugs and substance abuse and the destruction it is causing.""

 This year's International Day Against Drug and Illicit Trafficking is themed ""The evidence is clear; invest in prevention.""", Albert Kuzor,Health, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Narcotics-Control-Commission-warns-children-against-the-use-of-illegal-drugs-1937830
PAPNG secures injunction against implementation of GRNMA's collective agreement,"The High Court, Labour Division, has granted an ex parte injunction in favour of the Professional Association of Psychiatric Nurses of Ghana (PAPNG) against the implementation of the collective agreement negotiated by the Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association (GRNMA), which was set to commence on July 1, 2024.

The injunction was obtained against the following parties:

The Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association

Fair Wages and Salaries Commission

The Controller and Accountant General

The Minister for Finance

The Attorney General

The court's decision effectively halts the implementation of the collective agreement negotiated by GRNMA, highlighting that PAPNG and other unions, such as the Union of Professional Nurses and Midwives, Ghana (UPNMG), were excluded from the negotiation process, violating statutory requirements.

PAPNG argued that GRNMA's actions breached the Labour Regulations, 2007 (LI 1833), which mandate consultation with all relevant unions during collective bargaining, and the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651), which ensures inclusive and fair representation in collective agreements.

In a statement, PAPNG expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating that it upholds the principles of fairness and inclusivity in collective bargaining processes, ensuring that the voices of all relevant unions are heard and respected.",,Health, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/PAPNG-secures-injunction-against-implementation-of-GRNMA-s-collective-agreement-1937819
Health Minister ends tour of Ashanti Region,"Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye has concluded his tour of the Ashanti region with an inspection of the Adansi North District Hospital-Fomena and the Sekyere Kumawu District Hospital, which are part of the seven district hospital projects signed by the Ministry of Health in 2012.

Dr. Abena Konadu Yawson, Medical Superintendent of Adansi District Hospital, and Dr. Alex Agbanu, Medical Superintendent of the Sekyere Kumawu District Hospital, who welcomed the Minister at their facilities, stated a few similar challenges affecting healthcare delivery in the hospitals.

These include inadequate staff, poor road networks leading to the facilities, frequent power outages, high costs of running the facility, and inadequate staff buses to transport staff to and from the hospital.

At the facilities, the Minister and his entourage visited the maternity wards, pediatric wards, accident and emergency wards, outpatient departments (OPD), physiotherapy units, pharmacy units, and the obstetrics and gynecology departments.

Okoe Boye met with the staff of the two facilities to interact, experience, and collect firsthand information on challenges.

He expressed his appreciation to the staff for the sacrifices made in improving healthcare delivery in the country and encouraged them to help make district hospitals attractive to their colleagues so they don't oppose postings to such places.

""I have not only come here to note your challenges, but I am going to work at full tilt with my team to resolve these challenges,"" he assured.

In an address, Ernest Yaw Anim, the MP for Kumawu Constituency, promised that the roads leading to the Kumawu District Hospital would be completed in the next month.

Effective drug policy must be based on scientific research  Akufo-Addo,"President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has stated that for drug policies to be effective, they must be grounded in scientific research, respect human rights, and demonstrate compassion and a profound understanding of the social, economic, and health implications of drug use.

He highlighted the global socio-economic situation that compels individuals to make risk-taking decisions, such as drug trafficking and abuse, noting that the dimensions and impact of drug trafficking are intensive, extensive, and complex.

The President made these remarks in a speech delivered on his behalf by Mr. Henry Quartey, the Minister for Interior, at the 2024 International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, also known as World Drug Day (WDD), in Accra.

The event, which also marked the launch of the 2023 World Drug Report, was themed ""The Evidence is Clear: Invest in Prevention.""

World Drug Day is observed annually on December 7, as designated by United Nations General Assembly resolution 42/112 in 1987, for Member States to raise awareness of the risks and effects of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking, as well as to consider the most effective countermeasures.

The President explained that the theme aims to draw global attention to the urgent need to intensify efforts to prevent trafficking and abuse of illicit drugs, which have caused devastating health conditions for millions worldwide.

He pointed out that drug trafficking facilitates drug consumption, leading to the development of substance use disorders (SUDs), a highly destructive and concerning health condition.

According to the 2023 World Drug Report, drug use disorders are damaging health, including mental health, safety, and well-being. The President noted that stigma and discrimination reduce the likelihood of individuals with drug use disorders receiving the help they need, with fewer than 20 percent currently in treatment and access being highly unequal.

President Akufo-Addo acknowledged that Ghana has not been spared the impact of drug trafficking, abuse, and related health problems. However, he expressed satisfaction that Ghana recognizes the challenges associated with implementing international and domestic drug policies, particularly concerning the health and safety of Ghanaian society.

He affirmed the government's commitment to continue providing necessary resources to the Narcotics Control Commission and other security agencies to perform their mandates efficiently, thus ensuring the safety and security of all Ghanaians.

The President highlighted Ghana's proactive steps in reforming the country's drug policies, including the enactment of the Narcotics Control Commission Act, 2020 (Act 1019), which addresses the nation's drug challenges.

He urged everyone to support law enforcement agencies in combating the drug menace.

Mr. Kenneth Adu-Amanfoh, the Director-General of the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), reported that last year, NACOC's Demand Reduction Directorate sensitized a total of 308,312 students across 1,322 educational institutions at all levels.

Furthermore, NACOC engaged 63 communities and 73 faith-based institutions, achievements made possible through collaboration with other relevant state institutions.

The Director-General revealed that NACOC is working with partners to establish Drop-In Centers in some regional capitals to offer counseling services to individuals suffering from SUDs, providing essential support for addiction recovery.

""NACOC is committed to ensuring that a scientific evidence-based approach is used in developing prevention outreach programs that are tested and effective in addressing drug use among the youth,"" he concluded.",,Health, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Effective-drug-policy-must-be-based-on-scientific-research-Akufo-Addo-1937708
"50% of Ghanaian doctors, 24% nurses working abroad as a result of poor conditions - GHDR report","A concerning trend has emerged from the latest Ghana Human Development Report, which highlights that half of the doctors trained in Ghana are now seeking employment abroad, driven away by substandard working conditions. 

The report, titled ""The Future Value of Work in Ghana,"" cautions that the nation's healthcare system is on the brink of deterioration if the ongoing departure of medical professionals is not curbed.

The United Nations Development Program, in collaboration with the Statistical Service and the National Development Planning Commission, authored the report. 

It reveals that alongside the 50 percent of migrating doctors, 24 percent of nurses trained in Ghana have also migrated for similar reasons. 

This alarming exodus has placed the health sector in jeopardy, necessitating immediate policy and practical interventions to prevent a complete collapse.

Despite Ghana's  health system's resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, it continues to grapple with significant challenges, including shortages of essential supplies like personal protective equipment and a dwindling pool of qualified personnel.

The ""Future of Work"" report emphasised the need for strategic implementation to meet the evolving health demands of the population, which are becoming increasingly complex due to environmental factors, demographic shifts, and lifestyle changes. 

Ghana's health policy has identified eleven critical areas needing reinforcement, with health promotion, palliative, and rehabilitative care falling behind preventive and curative services. 

The report advocates for a health promotion approach that emphasizes primary healthcare and environmental concerns, which can significantly impact human capital development.

Furthermore, the report suggests adopting a life course approach to healthcare delivery, catering to diverse population segments, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and marginalized individuals in urban slums. 

This approach aims to ensure that all groups can access and benefit from both curative and preventive healthcare services. The stark reality of the situation calls for decisive action to retain the nation's medical talent and safeguard the future of Ghana's healthcare system.

Although he sought spiritual assistance from some prophets, his condition did not improve.

Dr. George Donkor, Chief Executive Officer of Nobel Trust Herbal Clinic, explained that the condition is not spiritual but a sexually transmitted infection requiring urgent surgery. 

Speaking on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM's Nyankonton Mu Nsem, he stated that attributing the issue to supernatural forces could be a coincidence.

He explained that the condition is classified as giant scrotal elephantiasis, ""a massive enlargement of the scrotum due to the thickening of tissue and accumulation of fluid.""

Dr. Donkor advised that medical surgery, not herbal treatment, is required. 

""He requires medical surgery, which could take four months to offer him the best treatment he deserves. It is deadly and can kill him. He should not waste time attributing it to spiritual forces. He requires immediate surgery by professional doctors,"" he said.

Do not take drugs with grape juice: Food-drug interactions,"Grape juice, while a healthy and refreshing beverage, can have surprising
interactions with certain medications, leading to potentially serious health
consequences. 

Its important for everyone, especially those on prescription medications, to understand how grape juice can affect drug efficacy and safety. 

This article explores the impact of grape juice on medication, lists common drugs affected in Ghana, and provides advice on how to take your medications safely.

Some medications affected by grape juice:

Grape juice can interfere with a variety of medications commonly prescribed in
Ghana. Here are some examples:

Statins (Cholesterol-lowering drugs):

Examples: Atorvastatin, Simvastatin

Effect: Grape juice can increase the blood levels of these medications, leading to a higher risk of side effects such as muscle pain or damage.

Calcium Channel Blockers (blood pressure medications):

Examples: Amlodipine, Nifedipine

Effect: Grape juice can enhance the effects of these drugs, potentially causing
excessive drops in blood pressure, leading to dizziness or fainting.

Antihistamines:

Examples: Fexofenadine

Effect: Grape juice can decrease the absorption of these drugs, making them less
effective in treating allergy symptoms.

Immunosuppressants:

Examples: Cyclosporine

Effect: Grape juice can increase the levels of these medications, raising the risk of toxicity and side effects.

Anti-Anxiety Drugs:

Examples: Buspirone

Effect: Grape juice can elevate the concentration of these drugs in the bloodstream, potentially causing increased drowsiness or sedation.

How grape juice affects drugs:

The primary mechanism by which grape juice affects medications is through its
interaction with enzymes in the liver and intestines. Grape juice, particularly
grapefruit juice contains compounds that inhibit the activity of the enzyme CYP3A4.

This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs. When CYP3A4 is inhibited, higher concentrations of the drug remain in the bloodstream for a longer period, increasing the risk of adverse effects and toxicity.

Additionally, grape juice can interfere with drug transporters in the intestines, which can either reduce or enhance the absorption of certain medications, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes or heightened side effects.

Safe ways to take your medications:

To avoid these interactions and ensure your medications work effectively, consider the following tips:

Water: The safest and most recommended option is to take your medications with a
full glass of water. This helps with proper absorption and minimizes the risk of
interactions.

Food: Some medications should be taken with food to enhance absorption or reduce
stomach irritation. Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare
provider or pharmacist.

Timing: If you must consume grape juice, try to space it several hours apart from your medication to reduce the risk of interaction. However, this might not completely eliminate the risk, so it is best to avoid grape juice altogether when on these medications.

General advice:

Consult Your Healthcare Provider: Always discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist
about any potential food and drug interactions when starting a new medication.

They can provide specific guidance based on your prescribed drugs.

Read Labels and Instructions: Pay close attention to medication labels and the
accompanying instructions. Some drugs will have specific warnings about food and
beverage interactions.

Stay Informed: Educate yourself about the medications you are taking and any
possible interactions with foods and drinks. Reliable sources include your healthcare provider, pharmacist, and reputable medical websites.

In conclusion, while grape juice is a nutritious choice for many, it can have
unintended and harmful interactions with certain medications. To ensure your safety and the effectiveness of your treatments, it is essential to take your medications with water and follow the advice of healthcare professionals.

By being informed and cautious, you can avoid the risks associated with these interactions and maintain better health outcomes.",,Health, 24 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Do-not-take-drugs-with-grape-juice-Food-drug-interactions-1937116
SCDSG advocates for greater participation of patient support organizations in policy development on World Sickle Cell Day,"World Sickle Cell Day, observed annually on June 19th, embraces the 2024 theme ""Hope Through Progress: Advancing Care Globally.""

This theme highlights the critical need for accessible and equitable healthcare across Ghana. It serves as a reminder to amplify awareness of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), evaluate its present impact, address the challenges it poses, and persist in efforts to break a cycle that has a profound effect on individuals and communities. 

SCDSG acknowledges the life-saving sacrifices made by the healthcare workforce, the government, and the Ministry of Health, along with all NGOs united in the fight against Sickle Cell Disease in Ghana. SCDSG also recognizes the trailblazers who ensure that greater awareness is created for Sickle Cell Disease as a whole in Ghana. 

Sickle Cell Disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, termed hemoglobin S (HbS). This anomaly causes red blood cells to stiffen and assume a sickle shape, potentially causing blockages in blood circulation, resulting in pain and potential organ damage. 

HbSS is the most prevalent and severe form of sickle cell disease (SCD), caused by inheriting two hemoglobin S genes. This leads to a shortened lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs), lasting only 10-20 days in contrast to the typical 120-day lifespan of normal RBCs. 

HbAS known as SCD-trait or carrier is a condition where one inherits one haemoglobin S gene and one normal hemoglobin A gene from parents. 

HbSC represents a less severe type of SCD, while the severity of HbS beta thalassemia depends on the level of normal beta-globin production. 

Annually, approximately 300,000 newborns are diagnosed with SCD, with 75% of the global burden of the disease concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

An estimated 50% to 90% of infants born with SCD in this region die undiagnosed before age five, largely due to the absence of affordable, comprehensive healthcare. 

Without prompt interventions, about 50-80% of individuals with SCD in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, will not survive into adulthood. 

Improved life expectancy can result from holistic healthcare that includes newborn screening, vaccinations, penicillin prophylaxis, hydroxyurea therapy, and regular medical evaluations to monitor patient conditions. 

Pain management and blood transfusions are crucial during sickle cell disease (SCD) crises. Lifesaving advocacy, community education, and genetic counseling are of equal importance. 

The incorporation of Hydroxyurea into Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) signifies a major advancement, providing hope to numerous individuals. 
However, the path to a comprehensive sickle cell disease management system accessible to all is far from complete. 

The Sickle Cell Disease Support Group (SCDSG) seizes this moment to shed light on the issues and obstacles that individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) encounter in Ghana. 

To start, the intermittent shortages of Hydroxyurea and its restricted availability under the National Health Insurance Scheme at major government hospitals nationwide, coupled with the inadequate drug compounding facilities in hospital pharmacies, pose daily critical challenges for SCD patients, which are vital for their survival. 

We urge the government to incorporate Penicillin Prophylaxis into the National Health Insurance Scheme to improve survival rates beyond the age of five for Sickle Cell Disease patients in Ghana. 

Moreover, the lack of Drug Compounding and Reconstitution Pharmacies in various Government Hospitals deters clinic attendance and poses a considerable threat to all SCD patients, especially children. 

corporate organizations, NGOs, churches, and individuals are encouraged to support the National Blood Service to ensure a consistent blood supply for all who need it, particularly to prevent deaths due to blood shortages. 

The Sickle Cell Disease Support Group (SCDSG) is advocating for the expansion of Specialised Sickle Cell clinics across the nation, including areas beyond the capital city, to guarantee equitable healthcare access for everyone. 

We additionally recommend that the general public become knowledgeable about their genotype to make informed choices that can prevent the occurrence of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) in newborns. 

To our cherished individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease, continue to embrace your support networkyour friends, family, and dedicated healthcare professionals who stand by you. Treasure every small victorythe times when discomfort subsides, when joy fills the air, and when hope softly whispers, ""You can do it."" Together, we can overcome and break the cycle of hematopoietic mutation that started 7,000 years ago. 

Blessings to all.",,Health, 24 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/SCDSG-advocates-for-greater-participation-of-patient-support-organizations-in-policy-development-on-World-Sickle-Cell-Day-1937091
"WASH: Journalists undergo training on latest trends, roles of media in advocating for improvements","Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are fundamental to human health, dignity, and development. They form the cornerstone of every sustainable development agenda, impacting health, education, economic productivity, and overall quality of life. Recognizing the critical importance of WASH, World Vision Ghana has taken proactive steps to reposition the sector as a key driver of national development.

Empowering Journalists to Drive WASH Advocacy

To ensure that issues of WASH are taken seriously by policymakers and the public, World Vision Ghana recently organized a ""Trainer of Trainers"" workshop for journalists from across the country. This initiative aimed to equip journalists with the latest information on WASH trends and underscore the vital role the media plays in advocating for WASH improvements.

During the workshop, experts highlighted the interconnectedness of WASH with various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 6, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The discussions revealed how achieving SDG 6 can positively influence other goals, such as eradicating hunger (SDG 2), combating climate change (SDG 13), and ensuring access to affordable and clean energy (SDG 7).

The State of WASH in Ghana

Despite progress, significant challenges remain. Alarmingly, 17.7% of Ghanaians still lack access to sanitation facilities. The implications of this are dire. According to a UNICEF report, a single gram of human feces can contain up to 10 million viruses, 1 million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts, and 100 parasite eggs. This highlights the urgent need to address open defecation and improve sanitation infrastructure.

Mr. Atta Arhin, World Vision Ghana WASH Technical Specialist and a key facilitator, emphasized the need for the state to take decisive action against open defecation and gaps in access to proper sanitation. He pointed out that without proper sanitation, the health risks and economic burdens on communities are enormous.

Menstrual Hygiene: A Critical Component of WASH

The workshop also addressed the often-overlooked issue of menstrual hygiene. Sandra Boakye, Executive Director of InspireHer, discussed how poor menstrual hygiene management affects girls and women, impacting their health, education, and economic opportunities. Journalists were urged to highlight these issues in their reportage to reduce the negative impacts on girls, women, and the broader community.

The Role of Journalists in Promoting WASH

A seasoned journalist, Ama Kudom Agyeman, stressed that journalists have a unique and powerful role in promoting WASH. She encouraged practitioners to incorporate WASH topics into various reporting niches, including nature, environmental, advocacy, science, and health reporting. She noted that by doing so, the Fourth Estate can ensure that WASH issues remain in the public eye and on the agenda of policymakers.

The workshop underscored the importance of partnerships for growth in the WASH sector. Media Coalition Against Open Defecation (MCODe) National Convenor, Mr. Francis Ameyibor, and National Coordinator for the Ghana WASH Journalists Network (GWJN), Justice Lee Adoboe, both stressed that collaborative efforts between the government, non-governmental organizations, the private sector, and the media are essential to achieve significant and sustainable improvements in WASH.

Conclusion

The importance of WASH cannot be overstated. It is indeed a catalyst for socio-economic development, directly affecting health, education, and economic productivity. As Ghana strives towards its development goals, it is imperative that WASH issues are prioritized and integrated into national development plans.

As Mahatma Gandhi once said, ""Sanitation is more important than independence."" This timeless quote serves as a reminder of the fundamental role that sanitation and hygiene play in the foundation of a healthy and prosperous society.

By empowering journalists and fostering partnerships, World Vision Ghana is making strides in advocating for and improving WASH, thus paving the way for a healthier and more prosperous nation.", Daniel Lartey,Health, 24 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/WASH-Journalists-undergo-training-on-latest-trends-roles-of-media-in-advocating-for-improvements-1936979
National HIV Ambassador Nana Yaa Nsarko challenges youth to know their HIV status and prevent spread,"In a powerful call to action, Queen Lady Nana Yaa Nsarko, Miss Malaika 2023 and National HIV Ambassador, addressed young Ghanaians during her ""Live On Campaign"" on the Ayi MensaAburi mountain stretch.

The campaign, which took place early Saturday morning, saw many young men and women gathered for their routine exercise up the hill, where Nana Yaa Nsarko seized the opportunity to educate them on HIV prevention and distribute condoms.

Amidst the rising tide of HIV infections in Ghana, the Ghana AIDS Commission and its partners, including the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) of the Ghana Health Service, estimated the 2023 national adult HIV prevalence at 1.53%. This translates to approximately 334,095 people living with HIV in Ghana, comprising 316,545 adults and 17,550 children.

Addressing the crowd, Queen Lady Nana Yaa Nsarko urged the youth to be bold in knowing their HIV status. ""Self-testing is a simple, private, and empowering way to take control of your health,"" she emphasized. She encouraged the youth not to condemn themselves but to ""condom themselves,"" highlighting that one mistake is all it takes to contract HIV, and prevention is paramount.

During the event, Nana Yaa Nsarko distributed condoms and provided vital information on HIV prevention. ""Knowledge is power,"" she stated, ""and knowing your status, irrespective of what it is, will give you the power to 'Live On' and make informed decisions about your health and future.""

"Bolt Food couriers take pledge to uphold highest standards of safety, hygiene, and food handling","In a move to enhance food delivery standards, Bolt Food couriers across Ghana have collectively taken a pledge to uphold the highest standards of safety, hygiene, and food handling. This follows an intensive training in partnership with the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) to reinforce the importance of these practices in ensuring the delivery of safe and hygienic food to customers.

The pledge taken by the couriers underscores Bolt Foods unwavering commitment to customer safety and satisfaction. With a focus on maintaining the integrity of food from preparation to delivery, couriers have vowed to adhere to strict protocols designed to protect both themselves and their customers.

The Acting Regulatory and Policy Head for Africa at Bolt, Weyinmi Aghadiuno, said: ""Bolt Food as market leaders committed to best practices and standards in food delivery, launched this initiative to  equip couriers on the platform with essential knowledge and tools for excellence in food delivery. It is our collective responsibility as stakeholders in the food service ecosystem to ensure food reaches customers safely and in an hygienic manner. By adhering to these best practices of food delivery, we are not only protecting the public health of Ghanaians but also contributing to the overall well-being of our communities.

Through this specialized training, couriers gained invaluable insights into food hygiene, safety practices, and proper handling techniques, reinforcing our dedication to the health and safety of the communities we serve."" She added.

The workshop addressed a pressing need in the rapidly expanding online food delivery sector, where maintaining food safety and quality is crucial. Recognizing the rise in online food businesses, the FDA partnered with Bolt Food to enhance food safety measures across the industry.

Chief Regulatory Officer at the FDA, Dr. Edward Archer emphasized the importance for courier operators to understand the impact of food safety measures on their operations.

""The FDA is collaborating with various stakeholders, including courier services, to ensure they receive training in food safety. This training equips them to integrate food safety principles into their work, thereby reducing food safety-related complaints and illnesses,"" Dr. Archer stated.

"Group raises alarm on disturbing increase in paediatric foot injuries, urges immediate action","A collaborative study carried out by The CARROT Co. and doctors from the Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) at Kumasi has indicated a call for stakeholders to prioritise tackling paediatric foot injuries.

The study, which was fully supported by Canadian-based The Sandbox Project, found that 3 or 4 out of every 100 children die from motor-vehicle accidents in Ghana.

Males between the ages of 5 and 9 are at a higher risk of having foot injuries and even end up having their limbs amputated than their female counterparts.

A stakeholders review meeting was held on Thursday, June 20, to present the findings of the study.

Consultant and Orthopaedic Surgeon at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Dr Vincent Ativor, bemoaned the financial strain and difficulties hindering the Ghanaian population from accessing the needed care for paediatric foot injuries.

Dr. Ativor indicated that the study was commissioned to help find solutions to paediatric foot injuries and to ultimately prevent amputations.

""The project is on looking at paediatric fractures or paediatric musculoskeletal injuries. We know that children are vulnerable and they get injured easily as compared to adults. They play around, they ran across major roads and get knocked down by vehicles. They climb objects and fall and they get hurt through playing sports.

""And we have seen that there has been an increasing trend of children involved in injuries and most importantly, foot and ankle injuries which are very severe with some of them resulting in amputation of the limbs or severe disabilities that limit children in playing and doing other activities. We had to strategise to see how we can address some challenges that we have identified during our study to evaluate the pattern of injury and also the incidence of injuries affected the foot.""

Dr. Ativor advised that wearing the appropriate footwear at the time of an accident reduces the risks of foot avulsion fractures by 49 per cent and must therefore be encouraged among the population to reduce fractures and infections.

The Executive Director of The CARROT Co., Taye Balogun, expressed gratitude to The Sandbox Project for its immense support in making the study a reality.

Taye also disclosed that the project has been running for the last three years and bemoaned the trauma parents go through having to see their children have one or both limbs amputated.

""The Sandbox Project is an initiative by Dr. K. Kellie Leitch who is an experienced Orthopedic doctor and we partnered with them because some Ghanaian doctors had gone to study in Canada and researched the paediatric foot injuries situation in Ghana and it was very alarming so we decided not to let it go under the carpet and needed to make the people aware and that was when we decided to find ways of engaging the public on the issue.

""We have been on this project for three years and I have been to the hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and I have been in the theatre with the surgeon and he operated about 10 people in 9 hours. I saw parents whose children walked into the hospital with two legs and came out with one and that is devastating and it becomes an obligation for some form of action to be taken,"" he said. 

Participants from basic schools, youth-led organisations, civil society, and the media were taken through group discussions and assignments, and they pledged their support to advocate for the prevention of paediatric foot injuries.

The CARROT Co. is a collective of pan-African artists, scholars and practitioners, working solely to support the development sector with creative communication bridging the gap between the mass population and policymakers. 

The aim of CARROT Co is to simplify policies, amplify messages and dignify African lives through storytelling with an emphasis on art, culture and indigenous knowledge.",,Health, 22 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Group-raises-alarm-on-disturbing-increase-in-paediatric-foot-injuries-urges-immediate-action-1936777
National Cardiothoracic Centre hosts free health screening for Ghana Police Service,"As part of its 35th-anniversary celebrations, the National Cardiothoracic Centre at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital organized a free health screening event for the Ghana Police Service.

The event, held at the police headquarters in Accra on Friday, June 21, 2024, saw hundreds of officers and civilians undergoing extensive medical checkups.

The screening assessed various health parameters, including blood pressure, height, weight, pulse, and oxygen saturation. Participants also received lab tests and medical advice based on their results.

Dr. Kow Entsua-Mensah, Director of the National Cardiothoracic Centre, highlighted the significance of this initiative.

To crown our celebration, we decided to organize a medical screening for the Ghana Police Service.

The police service is one of the most important and delicate institutions in the entire country. When we sat down as a centre, we realized that even the peace of mind to come to work takes some people in the background to ensure that there is security, he said.

He further emphasized the importance of maintaining the health and well-being of police officers.

We realized as a centre that these are people who need to be kept well, strong, and healthy at all times. So, we dedicated this day to reach out to the Ghana Police Service and conduct a free medical screening for all of them.

This is a token of appreciation to tell the Ghana Police that we appreciate and value the work they do and that we cherish their input into the peace and security of the country, he added.

Dr. Innocent Adzamli, a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon at the National Cardiothoracic Centre, added, As part of our planning, we thought it wise that we need to give back to our society.

We think that we can give back to society through the Ghana Police Service, so we have come to the headquarters to screen them for what we call cardiovascular risk diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

Commissioner of Police (COP) Mohammed Suraji, Director-General of Operations for the Ghana Police Service, expressed gratitude on behalf of the police.

He praised the team for their efforts and emphasized the need for more such activities to ensure the well-being of police officers, which in turn contributes to the peace and development of the country.

About 50 people infected with HIV in Ghana daily - Report,"The Ghana AIDS Commission has expressed concern over the disturbing statistics, as its 2023 National HIV Report revealed that an estimated 50 people are infected every day in Ghana.

Additionally, more than 218,000 persons infected do not know their status.

Currently, there are more than 152,000 people on anti-retroviral therapy (ART medication), and of this number, 36,000 are male adults, 109,000 are female adults, and 5,000 are children.

These numbers run the risk of jeopardizing the Commission's and its partners' aim to achieve an epidemic-free country.

But more worrying is the projection in Accra, pointing to persons between the ages of 15 and 49 who are economically active, representing the bulk number of infections.

The National Adult HIV prevalence for 2023 is estimated at 1.53%, with the number of people living with HIV estimated at 334,095, which is made up of 316,545 adults (94.7%) and 17,550 children (5.3%).

The HIV Adults aged between 15 to 49 incident rate in 2023 is estimated at 0.09% with 17,774 estimated new infections (90.4% adults and 9.6% children) and 12,480 AIDS deaths.",,Health, 22 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/About-50-people-infected-with-HIV-in-Ghana-daily-Report-1936750
The Trust Cancer Care Academy: Addressing Ghana's cancer care crisis - a call for advocacy and action,"The Trust Hospital Company Ltd. convened The Trust Cancer Care Academy in Accra from June 12th to 14th, with the central theme of ""Closing the Care Gap: Advancing Cancer Care through Education and Collaboration."" 

The event, hosted at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, brought together prominent figures within Ghana's cancer treatment network. 

These experts expressed significant unease regarding the nation's elevated cancer patient mortality rate, citing insufficient cancer care and treatment as contributory factors.

Health professionals, academicians, and policymakers highlighted severe deficiencies in data collection, the absence of a comprehensive cancer registry, and insufficient policies and health facilities.

The three-day event which saw over 800 people in attendance both in-person and online featured discussions on critical topics, including the analysis of the epidemiology of the most common cancers in Ghana, the critical issue of skin malignancies, the vital role of pharmacists in cancer care, common pediatric cancer prevalence and management options, radiotherapy techniques in cancer management, and the pathophysiology of cancer pain and its management.

Dr. Florence Dedey, a senior lecturer at the University of Ghana Medical School's Department of Surgery and Head of Surgical Unit and Consultant General Surgeon, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital), provided insights into the epidemiology of the five most prevalent cancers in Ghana. 

She emphasized that Ghana's cancer care and treatment policies and data are notably outdated and insufficient. Dr. Dedey emphasized that the current policy guiding cancer care in Ghana, the National Cancer Control Plan, was designed to be effective from 2012 to 2016, yet it has not undergone recent revisions.

New Childrens Hospital to revolutionize child health - Okoe Boye,"In a move to strengthen child healthcare in the country, the government of Ghana has committed significant resources to constructing several facilities across the country, including a state-of-the-art children's hospital at Weija. This development comes amidst growing concerns about the deteriorating condition of the Princess Marie Louise Hospital, the capital's only public children's hospital.

The new 120-bed facility, funded by the World Bank at $9 million, is already 65% complete, according to Joseph Adams, the contractor from Awerco Construction Limited. He informed Health Minister Dr. Bernard Okoe-Boye that they are on track to meet the September completion deadline. 

The hospital will feature an emergency unit, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, recovery wards, three theaters, VIP wards, imaging and biomedical laboratories, an outpatient department (OPD), and a mother's hotel. The completion of this hospital is expected to alleviate the pressure on the Princess Marie Louise Hospital, facilitating essential future renovation works for the aging facility.

Health Minister Dr. Bernard Okoe-Boye commended the contractors for their progress and urged them to adhere to the timelines. He also encouraged them to employ skilled locals from the community to support the local economy.

Addressing the media, the minister stated, ""This project underscores the Akufo-Addo-Bawumia administration's commitment to enhancing pediatric care in Ghana. Once operational, this new hospital will significantly improve healthcare delivery for children in Accra and beyond.""

This initiative is part of a broader effort by the government to enhance healthcare infrastructure nationwide, with a special focus on child health. In Kumasi, the Ashanti regional capital, significant progress is also being made on the 500-unit Maternity and Children's Block at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). 

The new block aims to replace the 45-year-old structure that was deemed structurally unsound and subsequently demolished. This project was revitalized through collaboration between the First Lady's office, the Manhyia Palace, and the Multimedia Group, resulting in the construction of a Mother and Baby Unit to address immediate congestion issues at KATH.

Further demonstrating the government's commitment to child health, in November 2021, childhood cancers were added to the coverage of the National Health Insurance Scheme. This policy includes the diagnosis and treatment of four major childhood cancers: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, Burkitt Lymphoma, Retinoblastoma, and Wilms Tumor. These cancers, which account for approximately 60% of all childhood cancers, are highly treatable if detected early.

Additionally, a 40-bed Pediatric Oncology block is under construction for the children's unit at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. This modern facility, developed in partnership with private sector entities, aims to significantly enhance healthcare delivery for the country's future generations. The new Mother and Child Centre, a centenary project of Korle Bu, set to replace the dilapidated Maternity block, promises to revolutionize maternity healthcare delivery at Ghanas premier health facility.

Dr. Bernard Okoe-Boye, during a recent visit, expressed optimism about the ongoing projects and their potential impact on healthcare delivery in the country. ""We are committed to ensuring that every child in Ghana has access to the best possible healthcare,"" he emphasized.

Highlighting the need for specialist hospitals, the Health Minister underscored Ghana's priority to develop such facilities. ""Moving forward as a country, we must prioritize specialist hospitals like children's hospitals to improve care, encourage specialized medical practice, and alleviate congestion among other challenges,"" Dr. Boye stated. 

He emphasized that these facilities are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare services, promoting specialization among medical professionals, and easing overcrowding in general hospitals. This strategic focus, he noted, will enhance the overall healthcare delivery system and ensure that the nation's youngest citizens receive the highest standard of medical attention.

As Ghana continues to advance in healthcare infrastructure and policy, the new children's hospital at Weija stands as a testament to the government's unwavering dedication to the well-being of its children.", Ernest Manu,Health, 21 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/New-Children-s-Hospital-to-revolutionize-child-health-Okoe-Boye-1936606
NPP never reported on National Health Insurance Levy collections since 2018 - Mintah Akandoh,"The Member of Parliament for Juaboso Constituency and ranking member on health in Parliament, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh has revealed that the Nana Addo-led administration never accounted for National Health Insurance Levy (NHIL) collections since 2018 till date.

 According to him, the National Health Insurance Act(Act 852) has mandatory statutory requirements in terms of transfer and reporting on NHIL collections.

 Speaking on the 7th edition of the NDC 360 show with Malik Basintale, Akandoh indicated the funding sources of the National Health Insurance fund are enumerated in Section 41 of Act 852 with the major source being the National Health Insurance Levy (currently 25% on all goods and services) as provided in Section 47, two and a half percentage points of each person's contribution to SSNIT, Grants, donations, gifts, voluntary contribution and monies approved by parliament.

 In addition, after collecting the levies, Section 52 (1)(2) of Act 852 stipulates that The Minister responsible for finance shall within thirty days after the collection of the Levy cause the Levy to be paid directly into the fund and furnish the Minister responsible for health and the authority with evidence of payment.""

 The minister responsible for finance shall present to Parliament every six months a report on the payment of levies into the fund.

 ""Under this NPP regime, they have never accounted or reported on what the Act stipulates, causing them to breach that law.

 However, the NPP government introduced The Earmarked Funds Capping and Realignment Bill through the finance minister on the 21st of March 2017 which was assented into Act by President Nana Addo on the 5th of April 2017 giving the finance ministry powers to redirect funds meant for the National Health Insurance Scheme into the consolidated account for other purposes.

UTI Prevention Tips: What every woman should know,"GhanaWeb Feature by: Bernice Owusuwaa

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a common health concern for many women, yet it is a topic that isn't discussed nearly enough. Women constantly strive to avoid UTIs to prevent repeatedly treating these infections.

Healthline.com explains that a UTI is an infection in the organs of your urinary tract, which includes the bladder and kidneys.

Some symptoms of a UTI, according to Healthline.com, may include:

- Burning with urination

- Increased frequency of urination without passing much urine

- Increased urgency of urination

- Bloody urine

- Cloudy urine

- Urine that looks like cola or tea

- Urine that has a strong odor

- Pelvic pain in women

- Rectal pain in men

Dr. Vanessa Mensah-Karbu, a General Practitioner at the West Africa Rescue Association, highlighted in an interview with GhanaWeb that pregnant women are the most susceptible to UTI infections. 

She emphasized that when left untreated, UTIs can have long-term effects on pregnant women, potentially leading to premature delivery of babies and kidney diseases.

Despite the commonality and potential severity of UTIs, the good news is that they are often preventable.

This GhanaWeb article highlights essential tips from medical professionals that every woman should know to prevent UTIs.

Stay Hydrated

It is important to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 6 to 8 glasses of water daily. Staying hydrated helps flush bacteria from the urinary tract. Also, limit the intake of caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder and lead to dehydration.

Practice Good Personal Hygiene

Always wipe from front to back after using the toilet to prevent bacteria from the anal area from spreading to the urethra. Avoid harsh soaps and douches that can irritate the urethra. Use mild, unscented products for genital hygiene.

Urinate Frequently

Dont hold it in. Urinate regularly and completely empty your bladder each time. Holding in urine can allow bacteria to grow. This is even more important if youre pregnant, as pregnancy puts you at an increased risk for a UTI. Holding your pee can further increase the risk. Urinate soon after sexual activity to help flush out bacteria that may have entered the urethra.

Choose the Right Clothing

- Wear Breathable Fabrics: Opt for cotton underwear and avoid tight-fitting pants to reduce moisture buildup, which can encourage bacterial growth.

- Change Out of Wet Clothes: Dont stay in wet swimsuits or sweaty workout clothes for long periods.

Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle

- Balanced Diet: Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to support your immune system.

- Regular Exercise: Engage in regular physical activity to maintain overall health and well-being.

Avoid Irritants

Avoid using scented feminine hygiene products, including sprays, powders, and washes, which can irritate the urethra and increase the risk of UTIs.

Know the Symptoms and Act Quickly

- Early Detection: Be aware of UTI symptoms such as a burning sensation during urination, a frequent urge to urinate, and cloudy or strong-smelling urine.

- Seek Prompt Treatment: If you suspect a UTI, seek medical advice promptly to prevent complications and recurrent infections.

In conclusion, if you experience any of the symptoms mentioned above, doctors advise you to visit a medical facility for a proper diagnosis and treatment. By following these tips, women can greatly reduce their risk of developing UTIs and maintain better urinary tract health.",,Health, 19 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/UTI-Prevention-Tips-What-every-woman-should-know-1936244

"2,000 CHAG facility managers pledge to adopt and institutionalize the SafeCare Quality Improvement approach in CHAG","The Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) has engaged close to 2000 management members of its facilities to take decisive steps towards the full adoption, ownership, and institutionalization of the SafeCare Quality Improvement program in all health facilities under CHAG for sustained and continuous improvement.

The nationwide engagement meeting of all healthcare facility management members forms a major step of the program's Phase II project, Developing viable business and operational models for sustainability and increased impact.

Speaking at the forum to discuss with the facilities management members about the sustainable adoption approach CHAG is taking to own and continue the ISQua-accredited SafeCare international standards locally, the Executive Director of CHAG, Dr. Peter Yeboah, said that CHAG member facilities are now regarded as the game changers in quality-based healthcare delivery in Ghana.

Dr Peter Yeboah emphasized that it has been four years since CHAG embarked on the transformative journey of SafeCare Quality Improvement, with facilities witnessing a paradigm shift in the provision of healthcare to its patients.
Barely 4 years ago, we signed onto a social contract with PharmAccess. CHAG has been known over the years as the sanctuary of health, hope, and healing, a safeguard of quality in the entire health system. But weve operated far too long on the perception level - the perceived quality of care. Were trusted and respected, but in an era of evidence-based actions, we cannot thrive only on hope and faith. As vital as they are, we need to demonstrate that our service provision is backed by science, and therefore, SafeCare was introduced. We wanted a structured, stepwise scientific way of measuring and benchmarking, identifying gaps, and coming up with innovative ways to address the gaps identified to ensure quality, he said.

Dr. Peter Yeboah indicated that CHAGs pioneering leadership has inspired and motivated the Ghana Health Service, the largest public healthcare provider in Ghana to adopt SafeCare quality standards as the surest way to achieving universal health coverage.

He emphasized that quality, as demonstrated through SafeCare, is a value proposition for the entire health sector, which Ghana should boldly adopt and institutionalize for all healthcare providers and facilities.

Twenty years ago, Ghana embraced the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Thanks to CHAGs pioneering role and innovative adoption of a community-based health insurance scheme, it was nationalized. Thankfully, we are now enjoying the benefits of the NHIS. Here we are today with another innovative program championed by a strong partnership between PharmAccess and CHAG. Dr. Yeboah added.

Dr Peter Yeboah, who is also a health policy, planning, and financing expert, charged CHAG member facilities to promote and guard the quality standards attained while striving for further improvement and excellence on their SafeCare journey.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about three million people die in the world annually from unsafe care. One in 10 patients is harmed in the process of seeking care, while an average of seven million people die in low- and middle-income countries from unsafe care. 

This underscores the need for quality healthcare to reduce the preventable deaths recorded in the various health facilities due to poor service delivery.
It is in this light that PharmAccess Ghana, in partnership with CHAG, uses the SafeCare Standards to benchmark and improve the quality of care across its network of facilities. This collaboration aims to ensure that healthcare services provided at CHAG facilities meet international quality standards, thereby improving patient outcomes and overall healthcare delivery in Ghana.

In 2020, trained ISQua-accredited SafeCare assessors were deployed to support facility managers in over 330 CHAG hospitals and clinics nationwide in improving quality. They also conducted a series of assessments using the SafeCare standards to ensure quality service delivery. The outcomes have been impressive, with 91% of the facilities demonstrating improvement in their scores, which impacts the delivery of care in these facilities.  

On his part, the Country Director for PharmAccess Ghana, Dr. Maxwell Antwi, revealed that the Ghana Health Service is gradually adopting, scaling up, and nationalizing SafeCare. 

He indicated that there is a collective anticipation of a future where the pursuit of quality healthcare is not a plea but an inherent aspect of the nations healthcare ethos. The journey toward quality healthcare for all is an ongoing endeavor, and these collaborative efforts are instrumental in forging a path toward a healthier and more resilient nation. 

Dr. Maxwell Antwi also said that SafeCare saves lives by improving health outcomes and reducing risks, and it improves the efficiency in the operations of healthcare facilities.

He added that some healthcare facility managers have adopted the SafeCare standards as a guide to run the operational systems of their hospitals and clinics.

Some facility managers, including administrators, who benefited from the program are excited about the quality outcomes. They commended CHAG and PharmAccess for rolling out SafeCare in Ghana.

An administrator from one of the facilities said, For us, SafeCare is very helpful; everyone in this facility is committed to quality. We dont have any other option than to be committed to quality care. If the client is happy that the services are safe and he or she is protected, we will have more clients and sustain the facility. Quality care minimizes complaints and even legal suits.
Another administrator also said, We have bolstered our team with strategic expertise to fortify our quality assurance measures. A dedicated risk manager now evaluates quality and provides invaluable guidance to our management. 

Additionally, we have enlisted the expertise of a seasoned physiotherapist and an adept equipment manager to oversee equipment management seamlessly. These strategic additions were prompted by meticulous assessments that pinpointed crucial gaps in our operations.""

The successful completion of the SafeCare Quality Improvement engagements by about two thousand CHAG facility managers marks a significant advancement in Ghana's healthcare sector. The adherence to international quality standards will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reinforce Ghana's journey towards achieving UHC by 2030. The commitment to continuous improvement and quality care will pave the way for a healthier and more buoyant nation.

SafeCare Director, Ghana, Bonifacia Benefo Agyei, emphasized the importance of ownership and commitment to continuous improvement.

According to her, the quality of healthcare delivery must be the key responsibility of healthcare facility managers.

She stated, 'The full adoption of SafeCare standards by CHAG facilities marks a significant step towards achieving excellence in healthcare delivery. It is not just about reaching higher scores but also about fostering a culture of quality and accountability. Quality is the responsibility of those in authority. The ownership of quality is not from bottom to top. It must be from the top. The leadership for quality is from the top.""

Deputy Executive Director of CHAG, Dr James Duah further encouraged the facility owners to ensure a sustained, implementation, ownership, and institutionalized SafeCare. He advised all facilities to have quality managers whose job it shall be to ensure that the facilities operate and adhere to the highest quality standards. 

If you have the flexibility of co-opting members into your management structure, then your quality managers must be co-opted into management so that every management he/she will sit in it. Alternatively, make a management member responsible for quality. Dr Duah noted.

Galamsey: A threat to herbal medicine usage - A call on the FDA and government,"Galamsey, the term for illegal small-scale gold mining in Ghana, has become a significant environmental and public health issue. While its impact on water bodies and agriculture is well-documented, the devastating effects on herbal medicine remain under-discussed. 

This article explores how galamsey activities lead to heavy metal contamination in medicinal plants, the loss of biodiversity, and the scarcity of raw materials for herbal medicine. It also highlights the inadequate quality control measures by the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and calls for urgent intervention from the FDA and the Government.

Heavy Metal Contamination: A Silent Health Crisis

Galamsey operations involve the use of toxic substances like mercury and lead, which contaminate soil and water. These heavy metals are absorbed by medicinal plants, posing severe health risks to consumers. Mercury exposure can damage the nervous system and kidneys, while lead poisoning can impair cognitive development and cause cardiovascular issues. Arsenic, another common contaminant, is a known carcinogen, and cadmium can lead to bone and kidney damage. The chronic consumption of herbal medicines contaminated with these metals exacerbates health problems, undermining the trust in traditional remedies.

Loss of Medicinal Plants: Erosion of Biodiversity

Illegal mining leads to deforestation and habitat destruction, resulting in the loss of numerous medicinal plant species. Forests are often cleared to make way for mining activities, destroying the natural habitats of plants like Griffonia simplicifolia, known for its antidepressant properties, and Prunus africana, used in prostate treatment. 

The extinction of these plants not only depletes vital natural resources but also disrupts ecological balance, making it difficult for these species to regenerate.

Contamination and Unavailability of Raw Materials

The contamination from galamsey activities extends beyond heavy metals. Chemicals used in mining leach into water bodies and soil, further tainting medicinal plants. This contamination poses a significant challenge for herbal medicine practitioners who struggle to find uncontaminated raw materials. 

The scarcity of safe, high-quality raw materials leads to increased production costs, which either raises the prices of herbal products or forces practitioners to compromise on quality, making traditional remedies less accessible and reliable.

Inadequate Quality Control by the FDA

The FDA's efforts to regulate and ensure the safety of herbal medicines are currently insufficient. Poor quality control measures and lack of rigorous testing protocols mean that contaminated herbal products can still reach the market. 

The FDA needs to enhance its monitoring and enforcement capabilities to safeguard public health effectively. This includes regular testing of herbal products for heavy metal contamination and other impurities, as well as stringent oversight of the sources of raw materials used in herbal medicine production.

Recommendations for the Government and FDA

To mitigate the adverse effects of galamsey on herbal medicine and ensure public safety, the following measures are recommended:

1. Stricter Enforcement of Mining Laws: The Government must enforce existing mining regulations rigorously and introduce harsher penalties for illegal mining activities. This will help protect critical habitats and water sources from contamination.

2. Environmental Remediation: The Government should initiate cleanup projects in areas affected by galamsey to decontaminate soil and water. This would help restore the natural habitats of medicinal plants.

3. Promotion of Sustainable Mining Practices: Legal, environmentally sustainable mining practices should be encouraged to balance economic interests with environmental preservation.

4. Enhanced FDA Monitoring and Testing: The FDA must implement more comprehensive testing of herbal products for contaminants and ensure that all products on the market meet strict safety standards.

5. Public Awareness Campaigns: Educating communities about the dangers of galamsey and the importance of preserving medicinal plants is crucial. Public support can drive grassroots efforts to combat illegal mining.

6. Support for Herbal Medicine Practitioners: The Government should provide financial and technical support to herbal medicine practitioners to help them source uncontaminated raw materials and maintain high production standards.

In conclusion, Galamsey poses a multifaceted threat to the herbal medicine industry in Ghana, from heavy metal contamination to the loss of medicinal plant species. The FDA and the Government must take decisive action to mitigate these risks, ensuring that herbal medicines remain safe, effective, and available for future generations. 

By preserving Ghana's rich botanical heritage and ensuring rigorous quality control, we can protect public health and sustain the cultural and economic benefits of traditional herbal medicine.", Yakubu Yakubu,Health, 15 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Galamsey-A-threat-to-herbal-medicine-usage-A-call-on-the-FDA-and-government-1935790
Youth advised to know their sickle cell status before falling in love,"Madam Charlotte Owusu, the founder of Sickle Cell Condition Advocate (SICCA), has emphasized the importance of knowing one's sickle cell status before falling in love. 

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that can be passed down from parents to children. If both parents are carriers of the sickle cell gene, there is a high chance that their children will inherit the disease.

Madam Owusu, interacting with staff of the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Tema, on the disease, stressed that many young people were unaware of the risks of having sickle cell disease in children and its implications on their relationships. 

She emphasised the need for education and awareness about sickle cell disease to be created, particularly among young people.

She urged young people to get tested for their genotype before committing to a relationship, as doing so would help them make informed choices to avoid bringing forth sickle cell patients, which come with a lot of pain, financial commitment, and psychological implications.

She stated that knowing your genetic compatibility before falling in love was a vital step in discovering what lies ahead, which could help safeguard the health and well-being of their future children.

""Knowing your genotype can help you make informed decisions about your health and your relationships. It is better to be aware of the risks and take steps to reduce them than to ignore them and suffer the consequences,"" she added. 

She encouraged people with AA genotypes to accept marrying SS, AS, and the other variants of sickle cell disease to help reduce and eradicate the disease in the country.

According to her, 75 percent of the population were of the AA genotype, while two percent were of the SS genotype, and the remaining 23 were carriers who could transfer to their children. ""Therefore, if 75 percent agreed to marry the others, it would make a significant difference in reducing the disease rate among Ghanaians and other black people,"" she stated.",,Health, 15 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Youth-advised-to-know-their-sickle-cell-status-before-falling-in-love-1935781
African healthcare leaders must be robust  Dr. Spio-Garbrah,"Hundreds of healthcare professionals, government officials, and private sector operators from across Africa and the globe converged in Cairo for a landmark conference focused on the education, training, and retention of African health professionals.

First Lady urges unified action to decrease HIV infections,"Mrs Rebecca Akufo-Addo, the First Lady, has urged a united front to fight HIV stigma, promote human rights, and ensure fair access to HIV prevention services for all. 

She emphasized that issues such as discrimination, stigma, lack of access to healthcare, and socioeconomic disparity need to be addressed for Ghana to achieve effective HIV prevention. 

These barriers do not only worsen the spread of HIV but also perpetuate inequality and injustice, it is imperative that we address these barriers head-on with courage and determination if we are to succeed in our mission, she said. 

Mrs Akufo-Addo was speaking at the 2024 National HIV Prevention Summit in Accra on Thursday. She said eradicating HIV stigma and discrimination called for a coordinated effort from all facets of society. The summit was on the theme Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges, Uniting for Effective HIV Response 

Mrs Akufo-Addo stressed the need to give communities the knowledge, resources, and support they need to take charge of their health and well-being and protect themselves and their loved ones from HIV. 

She said society must urgently and fully implement HIV prevention measures and make sure that everyone who needs them receives them. 

Innovations in HIV prevention for all categories of persons currently include long-acting injectables, the vagina ring treatment and prevention of mother-to-child transmission protocols, which have been enhanced with highly effective antiretroviral medications and point-of-care screening devices. 

Dr Kyeremeh Atuahene, Director General of the Ghana AIDs Commission said the fight against HIV and AIDS response was at a crucial stage, with scientific tools and proven strategies to eliminate the disease readily available to combat global economic challenges.  

Insufficient financing, noncompliance with preventive measures, and persistent stigma and discrimination, he claimed, were preventing Ghana from providing the basic HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services that are required to bring the epidemic under control by 2030. 

Dr. Atuahene said HIV is acquired and transmitted daily in every community in Ghana. 

We have to talk about HIV prevention because new infections are very high since the sexual behaviours that drive HIV transmission and acquisition are increasingly pervasive with rising levels of high-risk sexual activities among both men and women in every region, he said. 

Dr. Atuahene said Ghana must prioritize the HIV prevention roadmap to establish a comprehensive national approach for preventative interventions and programmatic scalability, which would help the country to meet the 2025 Global AIDS Targets. 

He said in efforts to reduce new infections, the GAC intends to provide people-centred prevention models of care to those at high risk of acquiring HIV. 

This years HIV Prevention Summit is expected to create a platform for stakeholders to develop a national agenda to prevent the disease. 

Dr Atuahene said the summit would finalize the milestones developed by the national HIV prevention coalition during the 2025 HIV Prevention Road Map Review and Milestone Setting Workshop earlier in the year.  

Considering this, the summit will explore innovative technologies, and foster collaborations to strengthen HIV prevention strategies in Ghana while solidifying accountability mechanisms for HIV prevention progress, he said.",,Health, 15 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/First-Lady-urges-unified-action-to-decrease-HIV-infections-1935674
Okoe Boye pushes for expedited clearance of essential Global Fund commodities,"In a deliberate action to ensure the clearance of essential health commodities funded by the Global Fund, the Minister of Health, Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye, has met with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) to streamline the clearance process at the Tema Port. 

This comes after a statement issued by the Ministry of Health confirmed the receipt of GHC 7,429,694.39 from the Ministry of Finance for the payment of demurrage and other third-party charges to ensure the clearance of all outstanding Global Fund containers.

The Ministry of Health emphasized the importance of this funding in its recent statement, stating, ""It is expected that with the funds received, all outstanding containers will be cleared by the end of June 2024."" 

However, in an interview with the media during a project inspection visit to the La General Hospital and Weija Childrens Hospital (both under construction), Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye intimated he was taking a personal interest in the matter and would not rest until the goods were cleared.

In pursuit of that, a meeting with the Ministry of Finance and the GRA on Friday, June 14, resolved that the clearance would be expedited to ensure the delivery of these life-saving medications, medical equipment, and other essential health commodities, making them readily available to safeguard public health.

This move demonstrates the commitment of the minister to improving healthcare delivery and ensuring timely access to vital health supplies.",,Health, 14 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Okoe-Boye-pushes-for-expedited-clearance-of-essential-Global-Fund-commodities-1935635
We will clear the backlog of essential drugs by June 30  Okoe Boye,"The Ministry of Health (MoH) has revealed that the backlog of medical supplies locked at the ports will be cleared within the next two weeks despite ultimatums by the minority and the global fund.

The Minority in Parliament yesterday waded into the controversies surrounding the clearing of over 180 containers of essential medical supplies at the port.

The supplies from Global Fund have been stuck at the port for more than a year now resulting in a threat from the fund to halt further shipments to Ghana.

The development has generated a back-and-forth between the CSOs in the health sector and the government.

The government is arguing the consignment contains only mosquito nets.

Minority spokesperson on Health Kwabena Mintah Akandoh charged the government to get the goods cleared regardless of the contents since the supplies were based on a request from the government describing the development as an international embarrassment.

Ghana has already run out of TB medications as health facilities have been rationing TB medications to patients since May 2023.

The government has only been able to clear about 60 of the containers since April.

The remaining containers are part of the 266 containers of essential drugs donated by the global fund at a cost of 40 million dollars.

The government is only required to cater for the taxes, levies, and port charges for the clearance of the commodities which was estimated at US$3.6 million dollars.

Addressing journalists during a tour of some health facilities in  Accra, Minister for Health Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye blamed third-party charges and lack of collaboration with the finance ministry led to the delays in clearing the containers.

We are committed to getting the containers out and for me personally, irrespective of the bureaucracies involved with government and all that I have given myself two weeks. In two weeks, I myself will not be encouraged if there are two more or one more container left at the port.

In fact, and this one you can take it from me. If by two weeks we still have containers at the port, you will not see me, I will be sitting rather at the port. I will sit at the port with them until everything comes out, he declared.

We could have handled this in a better way. There are two factors that accounted for what happened. The processes that we go through to clear containers as a result of some exemption bills that have been put in place, there were new lines to pay some third party charges that were introduced but it is still not an excuse.

The Ministry of Health must work closely with the Ministry of Finance. I dont think it was excellent in the past. We put in place measures to make it seamless so that no Ghanaian will hear that something meant for Ghanaian is stacked at the port.",,Health, 14 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/We-will-clear-the-backlog-of-essential-drugs-by-June-30-Okoe-Boye-1935601
"Watch as Okoe Boye goes bonkers over Global Fund drugs stuck at Tema port, threatens Finance Minister, GRA boss","The Minister of Health, Dr. Bernard Okoe-Boye, expressed his frustration over the numerous containers of medical supplies from the Global Fund that are stuck at Tema Port.

The supplies, valued at around $40 million, were donated to the Ministry of Health by the Fund to assist in Ghana's battle against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

Reports indicate that out of the 182 containers of medical supplies sent to Ghana, only 14 have been cleared by the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), leaving the rest detained at Tema port due to unpaid third-party fees.

During an appearance on Metro TV's Good Morning Ghana program on Thursday, June 13, 2024, Dr. Bernard Okoe-Boye criticized the Ministry of Finance and the GRA for failing to clear the supplies.

He pointed out that unnecessary bureaucracy is causing essential medical materials to be stuck at the port when they are urgently needed by Ghanaians.

The Health Minister gave the Minister of Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, and the GRA Commissioner-General, Julie Essiam, a two-week ultimatum to clear the remaining medical supplies, warning that they would face consequences if they did not comply.

""I will not tolerate these containers remaining at the port beyond June. They must be cleared this month... If it were up to me, they would have been cleared this morning or three days ago. I don't accept excuses or delays due to bureaucracy. I have given myself and the state two weeks. If they are not cleared by then, the GRA Commissioner-General will not have peace in her office. Amin and Eva will not be able to sit in their offices,"" he stated.

The minister also threatened to leave his office and join the protesters demanding the release of the medical supplies at Tema port.

We dont have any HIV drugs locked up at the port  Ministry of Health,"The Ministry of Health has refuted allegations that containers held at the Tema port contain essential drugs for Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS.

This response follows concerns raised by health-focused Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) about the Global Fund's threats to halt funding and donations to Ghana if the containers are not cleared.

Contrary to the CSOs' assertions that vital drugs are decaying at the ports, Isaac Offei Baah, Public Relations Officer for the Health Ministry, clarified that the containers in question actually contain mosquito nets.

I want to put it on record that we have mosquito nets and we dont have anything like HIV drugs or TB drugs [locked up at the port], Mr.Baah stated.

He assured the public that the ministry is actively working to distribute the mosquito nets.

Once it is something that has been given to the people of Ghana, we are working towards making it out and putting it to good use, he said.

"Fish head, bones are rich in micronutrients  FAO","The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has stated that some fish parts such as the head, bones, and trimmings, which represent 30 to 70 per cent of the whole fish, are rich in micronutrients.

The FAO disclosed this in its In Brief: The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024. Blue Transformation in Action, which is available to the Ghana News Agency.

It stated that aquatic foods are considered among the healthiest foods, and their consumption is linked to improved public health outcomes.

The consumption of whole fish, it noted, provides important essential nutrients, particularly omega-three fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins, and is relatively affordable, ensuring low-income populations have access to nutritious foods.

During processing, many parts considered not edible are often discarded, for example, the head, bones, skin, scales, and trimmings, representing 3070 percent of the whole fish weight.

The FAO said those parts were rich in micronutrients, and the adoption of simple low-cost technologies such as drying, smoking, fermentation, and milling can transform them into affordable and nutritious products.

FAO supports home-grown school feeding programmes to produce aquatic foods using underutilised locally produced small fish or fish powders made from fisheries by-products.

The organisation cited that the use in school feeding programmes of dried fish powder produced from tuna frames in Ghana and fish cake made from whole tilapia in Guatemala was highly acceptable.

It also stated that the use of whole fish improved the level of micronutrients in the meal, reduced the cost per meal, and lessened the environmental impact.

The FAO, however, added that promoting the consumption of aquatic foods and increasing public awareness of their nutritional and health benefits remained a significant challenge without up-to-date and accurate composition data on aquatic foods.

It noted that to address this gap, FAO has prepared a global nutrient conversion table for application to the FAO Supply Utilisation Accounts, based on national or regional food composition data, adding that the global table provides the data required to generate statistics on aquatic foods for energy, micronutrients, and polyunsaturated and omega-three fatty acids.

The report stated that a three-year FAO-led project was updating the International Network of Food Data Systems to expand information on the nutrient composition of small fish species, processed fish, and algae.",,Health, 13 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Fish-head-bones-are-rich-in-micronutrients-FAO-1935424

Health related SDGs formally inaugurated,"The fast-paced, various SDG goals that are supposed to be achieved by 2030, which include taking care of our health, have been inaugurated in Accra on Monday, 3rd June.

 This is a major breakthrough for the country as the new think tank outfit, HHSDG, is set to boost our mood, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.

 The preamble of the new think tank's purpose is a health-related nation-state project considering our freedoms, expanding liberties and fundamental rights, opportunities, and prosperity for all; and that the system of government, on whose shoulders the task of achieving these goals rests, derives their authority from the will of 'we the people.'

 In his speech during the formal unveiling, Frederick Ato Armah, the Chairperson of the occasion, emphasized the fact that the think tank comprises academia, civil society, industry, government, policymakers, and communities. He also noted that we have to come together to respond to the imperative of addressing the HHSDGs from a cross-sectoral perspective.

 By working together across sectors, we can address the complex health challenges and achieve the SDGs, creating a healthier and more sustainable future for all. Think tanks are meant to generate knowledge and bridge the interface between science and policy.

 A speech read on behalf of the Minister for Health, Dr. Oko-Boye, by the Chief Director, mentioned the fact that health-related issues are a serious business for the government and, for that matter, he used the opportunity to thank the organizers for putting this meeting together to discuss and agree on collaborative approaches for speeding up our progress towards the attainment of the SDGs in Ghana.

 He also noted that the government, in recent years, has developed and implemented several interventions to facilitate the SDGs in Ghana.

 ""At the policy level, we have developed the National Health Policy 2020; UHC Roadmap (2020-2030); Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan (2020-2030); Essential Health Service Package; National Healthcare Insurance Scheme (NHIS) (digital interventions) to improve enrollment and equity; primary healthcare through improving the availability and accessibility of essential health services (NoPs with support from the World Bank) at the community level; community engagement through community-based health programs and citizens' involvement in healthcare decision-making (community scorecard); and improving partnerships and collaborations with international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector through the common management arrangements framework.""

 He also noted that think tanks play a crucial role in modern society, and the importance of think tanks can be seen on several fronts, providing critical inputs and driving processes to support development, to the extent that it brings to the fore and unearths key and critical issues that are required to help reshape public policy, drive innovation, promote evidence-based decision-making, in this way contributing to a more informed and inclusive process of development.", Frank Owusu Obimpeh,Health, 11 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Health-related-SDGs-formally-inaugurated-1935171
We cant guarantee safety of most animal products on sale - Veterinary Services Directorate warns public,"Members of the public have been advised to take responsibility for the animal products they consume to protect their health.

 According to the Veterinary Services Directorate (VSD) of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), it cannot guarantee the safety of most animal products on the markets due to the level of public resistance it continues to face in the discharge of its mandate as well as resource constraints.

 You are what you eat so when buying food, especially animal products and you are told this animal is not in good condition, it's not from recognised sources, it unhealthy for consumption and you buy because it's cheap, it's your own health you are putting at risk, the Greater Accra Regional Veterinary Director, Dr Joseph Kofi Abuh, cautioned.

 He spoke at the launch of this years Food Safety Month in Accra on Friday on the theme: Food Safety: Preparing for the unexpected.

 This year, the annual event dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of food safety for public health emphasises the need for proactive measures and resilience in managing food safety risks, especially those related to animal health.

 Underscoring the importance of animal health in ensuring food safety, the Regional Director stressed the need to fully empower the VSD to discharge its role to prevent foodborne illnesses and maintain the safety and integrity of the food value chain.

 We are the authority for animal health and veterinary public health but we are constrained in terms of finances, human resources, and logistics among others.

 ""...Our officers on the ground are sometimes physically abused, we dont always have the full cooperation of the police to enforce the law. Some of these butchers also have political backings, if not, slaughterhouses in Accra, like Tulaku, Avenor and Jamestown should have been closed down by now because we have raised alarm several times of the unhealthy practices at these places.

 Dr Abuh, called for the expedition of the review of the Diseases Animal Act 1961 to institute the Animal Health Bill and among others, clearly define the roles of stakeholders along the animal production value chain.

 We believe the Animal Health Bill is very critical for food security and public health. The bill has been undergoing review since 2010 and is currently with the Attorney Generals office. We want them to speed it up to move it to parliament so it can be passed into law.

 The Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Yaw Fenteng Danso, launching the month-long campaign, said the VSD was committed to being at the forefront of ensuring that food products of animal origin were safe for public consumption.

 This month is an opportunity for us to come together and reaffirm our commitment to protecting public health through improved animal health practices and preparedness.

 Preparing for the unexpected in animal health is crucial for food safety and by prioritising animal health, we can enhance food safety, protect consumers and promote sustainable agricultural practices, he stated.

 As part of the celebration, the VSD outlined activities to be held within the month, including food safety campaigns at selected slaughterhouses and abattoirs, food safety campaigns in schools and cooking competitions.

 More than 600 million people fall ill and 420,000 die each year from eating contaminated food, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Experts shed light on causes of the rise of heart disease among young Ghanaians,"Two specialists recently shared insights on a concerning trend in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African nations: the increasing prevalence of heart disease among young individuals.

During the 12th Leadership Dialogue Series hosted by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) on June 6, 2024, Dr. Winfred Baah, a Consultant Physician at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, and Pearl Exornam Selormey, a Registered Dietician Nutritionist, highlighted this worrisome development and proposed strategies to address it.

Dr. Baah referred to a study from a Nairobi university hospital showing that 27.2% of hospitalized acute coronary syndrome patients were under 50, with over half being smokers.

He emphasized the urgency of addressing heart disease in youth, noting its typically poor prognosis due to delayed medical care.

Dr. Baah noted that the situation in Ghana reflects a broader global trend, where 13.9 million children and young people are affected by heart disease.

""The early onset of heart disease in young individuals generally leads to a poor prognosis,"" Dr. Baah warned during the virtual event. ""Many young people do not seek medical care and often present with advanced stages of the disease, making management more difficult.""

Pearl Exornam Selormey discussed dietary factors contributing to heart disease, citing data indicating high obesity rates among Ghanaian women.

""When I saw the data that 50% of Ghanaian women are obese, I was a bit frightened. It means that we have a very high number of our women population at a very high risk factor for heart disease,"" she said.

https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=Key%20Drivers%20of%20Heart%20Disease%20Among%20Young%20Ghanaians

During their separate presentations, both experts identified several lifestyle factors contributing to the rise of heart disease among Ghanaians aged 18 to 45. These include:

  Obesity and Poor Diet: An increasing consumption of unhealthy foods.

  Physical Inactivity: Sedentary lifestyles are becoming more common.

  Substance Use: A rising use of smoking, including cigarettes and shisha, and other substances such as cocaine, opioids, electronic cigarettes, anabolic steroids, and glue.

""The smoking of shisha is becoming very common, especially among young women, due to the misconception that it is healthier than cigarette smoking,"" Dr. Baah noted. ""Studies have shown that shisha smoking is a significant risk factor for heart disease.""

The experts stressed the need for systemic changes in healthcare, preventive education, and national health campaigns to combat this rising trend.

With concerted efforts, they believe it's possible to mitigate the impact of heart disease and secure a healthier future for Ghana's youth.",,Health, 10 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Experts-shed-light-on-causes-of-the-rise-of-heart-disease-among-young-Ghanaians-1934904
Ashanti Region: Ghana Health Service to distribute mosquito nets to households in 41 districts,"The Ashanti Regional branch of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) is set to embark on a household mass distribution of Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) in 41 districts of the region.

The move, according to GHS, is part of efforts to control malaria in the region and the country at large.

GHS observed that the distribution is also geared towards replacing mosquito nets distributed by the program three years ago with new nets. 

Addressing the media at the launch of the distribution exercise on Thursday, June 6, 2024, the Ashanti Regional Director of Health, Dr. Emmanuel Tenkorang, said GHS will use five days to register households in the region. 

He revealed that the registration will commence on June 7 and end on June 11, 2024.

Dr. Tenkorang added that the distribution of the nets will follow right after the registration exercise.

However, he emphasized that the public will have to take their coupons to the various distribution points for their nets.

He indicated that the health officers, upon receiving the coupons, will give the individual the number of nets required per the data on the coupon. 

Dr. Emmanuel Tenkorang advised that everyone, especially pregnant women and children under five, sleep under treated mosquito nets to prevent malaria.

He added that sleeping under a mosquito net was one of the best ways to reduce malaria in the country.

The platform sought to create a leadership framework supporting the strategic shift from malaria control to elimination and global eradication, towards creating a shared understanding and knowledge-based science of malaria.

Professor Evelyn Ansah, UHAS Lead for the Science of Defeating Malaria Joint Secretariat, Ghana, said the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic had reactivated efforts to do things differently and empower researchers and scientific institutions to innovate to eradicate malaria.

She said the Leadership Development Course was replicated in Africa, with the maiden edition held last year by Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal, under the auspices of Prof Dauda Ndiaye, an alumnus of the 2012 edition.

Prof Ansah, the Director of the Centre for Malaria Research at UHAS, said the transition of the course to Africa was marked by the change in its former name from 'Science of Eradication: Malaria' to 'Science of Defeating Malaria.'

She paid glowing tribute to the pacesetters, Professors Dyann Wirth of Harvard University, Pedro Alonso of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, and Marcel Tanner of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, who established the game-changing LDC in 2012.

The course curriculum has evolved and adapted to the changing needs of the global malaria community, with major actors involved in a global engagement called: 'Rethinking Malaria in the Context of COVID-19.'

Prof Ansah said the Centre was eager to use its network of professionals and teaching faculties to move the course to malaria-endemic countries in a sustained and equitable manner that builds upon a priority of partnering with African universities.

Prof Lydia Aziato, the Vice-Chancellor of UHAS, in a welcoming remark, said the cross-institutional and country support underscores the significance of global collaboration, teamwork in research, and academic fellowship in the fight against malaria, one of humanitys most persistent global health challenges.

She was optimistic that the leadership course would present a unique opportunity to sharpen skills and forge new pathways towards malaria eradication and urged participants to help drive change in their communities, institutions, and at the country level.

She commended Prof Ansah, Ms Carmen Mejia from Harvard University, US, and Prof Dauda Ndiaye from Cheikh Anta Diop University in Senegal, as well as the planning committee, for their unwavering commitment to the success of the programme.

Addressing the participants, Dr Anthony Nsiah Asare, the Presidential Advisor on Health, said Ghana had made significant progress in efforts to control and eliminate malaria over the years, though it is identified as one of the top 10 high-burden countries in the world.

He said malaria deaths had seen a consistent dip from the high of 3,259 in 2011 to 147 in 2022, with parasite prevalence in children under five years reducing to 8.6 per cent in 2022 from 27.5 per cent in 2011.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) and other partners in the global health community are working assiduously to ensure sufficient vaccine supply to meet demand and benefit children in areas designated as high endemic, with the LDC offering the platform for cross-fertilization of ideas.

Dr Nsiah Asare expressed optimism that the Yaounde Declaration for Accelerated Malaria Mortality Reduction in Africa would be translated into tangible initiatives, backed by political and multisectoral support for national programmes, strategic use of the best technical guidance and information, and strengthening of health systems.

He said the government was upbeat about the eradication of malaria and consequently unveiled the National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan (NMESP) 2024-2028 on the theme: 'Zero Malaria Starts Now: Launching Ghanas Path to Elimination.'

He urged the participants  scientists, researchers, advocates, educators, and policy advisors  to use the rich platform to create networks towards the course for eradication and commended UHAS for hosting the programme on behalf of the Government.

Breast Cancer Society of Ghana screens women in Tamale,"The Breast Cancer Society of Ghana has organised a health screening exercise for women in Tamale, as part of its breast cancer awareness campaign.

The campaign, which was organised in partnership with Cancer Care for Humanity International, sought to increase awareness of breast cancer care and the need to seek early medical attention.

The collaboration, forming part of the activities to mark this year's Mother's Day celebration, aimed to address various misconceptions associated with breast cancer.

Madam Enam Setsoafia, Chairperson of the Screening and Outreach Department at the Breast Cancer Society of Ghana, addressing the women during the event, underscored the importance of early screening and said it helped to sustain lives and minimise deaths.

She stated that breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths among women and advised them to desist from excessive alcohol consumption and other lifestyles that had the tendency to expose them to the disease.

She explained that breast cancer was not gender-biased and could affect men as well.

She touched on the treatment modalities and said it was expensive to treat breast cancer, advising members of the public to prioritise screening to avert the exorbitant treatment costs associated with the disease.

Mrs. Gifty Safo Annan, an Oncology Nurse Specialist and Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Care for Humanity International, said it was important for the government to demonstrate more commitment to fighting breast cancer by providing the necessary equipment to facilitate treatment.

She said the Northern Region did not have a radiotherapy centre, which made health workers vulnerable in fighting breast cancer cases.

She appealed to the government and philanthropists to support the fight to ensure that more women were protected against breast cancer in the country.

Madam Atika Abudu, a breast cancer survivor, also shared her experience with the disease and said screening and early medication were key to safeguarding the lives of women.

Out of the 61 women screened, 58 recorded negative, while three were detected with lumps in their breasts.

39 out of the total number screened were over 40 years and were advised to undergo a mammogram for further examination.

Only 16 of them expressed interest in undergoing the breast mammogram, while the rest could not do the mammogram due to financial constraints.",,Health,  8 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Breast-Cancer-Society-of-Ghana-screens-women-in-Tamale-1934751
1 hour shisha use equivalent to smoking 200 cigarettes  FDA,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), Mrs. Delese Mimi Darko, has urged individuals to stop smoking Shisha, saying that just one hour of Shisha use is equivalent to smoking about 200 cigarettes.

 She stated that eight million people die worldwide as a result of the use of tobacco products, which could have been prevented.

 Let us acknowledge the stark reality before us: tobacco stands as one of the foremost perpetrators of preventable death worldwide, claiming over 8 million lives annually. Its a public health crisis that spares no one, particularly our children, she said.

 The CEO, whose speech was delivered on her behalf by the Deputy CEO for Corporate Services Division, Mrs. Yvonne Nkrumah, on Friday in Accra to commemorate World No Tobacco Day, said a survey conducted by Global Youth Tobacco 2017, showed that 8.8 percent of students were using tobacco products which included shisha, while 8.5 percent were turning to Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems like e-cigs and vapes.

 The World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) is an annual event held on May 31 across the World to emphasise the harmful effects of tobacco and other tobacco products on health.

 The theme for this years commemoration is Protecting children from tobacco industry interference.

 The event, which was organised by the FDA in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) and Vision for Alternative Development-Ghana (VALD), was to help raise awareness about the strategies employed by the tobacco industry to lure children and adolescents.

 Mrs. Darko noted that, the tobacco industry, with its insidious marketing strategies, preys upon our youth, ensnaring them in a web of addiction and suffering.

 Earlier, Deputy Minister of Health, Mr. Alexander Akwasi Acquah, said through the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) Project 2030, there had been the successful development of a 5-year National Tobacco Control Strategy being implemented.

 He said there had been marked improvement in the strengthening of inter-agency coordination, revision of the smoke free policy, implementation and enforcement on the ban on tobacco advertisement.

 The Head of Research Unit of GRA, Dr Alex Kombat, said Tobacco Excise Tax Revenue has grown from Ghc 66.98 million in 2017 to Ghc 936 million in 2023, however, it costs the country GH668million every year to fight the use of tobacco.",,Health,  8 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/1-hour-shisha-use-equivalent-to-smoking-200-cigarettes-FDA-1934740

The critical role of preverbal skills in early childhood communication development,"Communication is an essential skill that profoundly impacts every child's life, from social interactions to academic success. As speech therapists, we understand that the foundation of effective communication is laid long before a child utters their first word.

 Preverbal skills are the building blocks of language development, and their early cultivation is crucial. This article will delve into the importance of these skills, how they develop, and the red flags parents should watch for that may indicate a delay or disorder.

Understanding Preverbal Skills

 Preverbal skills encompass a range of nonverbal behaviors and abilities that precede spoken language. These include:

 Joint Attention: The shared focus of two individuals on an object or event. It's crucial for learning and social interaction.

 Eye Contact: Engaging in mutual gaze, which helps establish a connection and indicates that a child is attentive.

 Gestures: Using hand movements, such as pointing or waving, to communicate needs or interests.

 Facial Expressions: Nonverbal cues that convey emotions and reactions. Vocalizations: Sounds that a child makes before forming actual words, such as cooing and babbling.

 Turn-taking: Engaging in back-and-forth interactions, foundational for conversational skills.

 These skills not only facilitate early communication but also support cognitive development and social-emotional growth.

The Importance of Preverbal Skills

 Preverbal skills serve several key functions:

 Building Blocks of Language: They lay the groundwork for understanding and producing language. For instance, joint attention is crucial for vocabulary development.

 Social Interaction: Effective communication fosters relationships and social bonds. Skills like eye contact and gestures are vital for engaging with others.

 Cognitive Development: Preverbal skills are linked to problem-solving and critical thinking. Turn-taking and imitation promote cognitive skills through interactive play.

 Emotional Expression: Nonverbal cues help children express their needs and emotions, reducing frustration and behavioral issues.

Red Flags for Delays or Disorders

 While each child develops at their own pace, certain signs may indicate a delay or disorder in communication development. Parents should be vigilant for the following red flags:

 Limited Eye Contact: Consistently avoiding eye contact can signal a concern. Lack of Joint Attention: Not following or initiating shared focus by 12 months can be worrisome.

 No Gesturing: By 12 months, a child should use gestures like pointing or waving.

 Minimal Vocalizations: Absence of cooing or babbling by 6 months or limited variety of sounds by 12 months.

 No Response to Name: By 9 months, a child should typically respond to their name.

 Failure to Imitate: Not imitating sounds, facial expressions, or movements by 18 months.

 Lack of Social Smiling: By 3 months, a child should smile at people. Steps for Parents

 If parents notice any of these red flags, early intervention is crucial. Here are steps to take:

 Consult a Pediatrician: Discuss concerns with your child's doctor to rule out any medical issues.

 Seek a Speech Therapist: A professional can evaluate your child's communication skills and provide guidance.

 Engage in Interactive Play: Activities that promote turn-taking, joint attention, and imitation can be very beneficial.

 Model and Reinforce: Use clear and simple language, gestures, and facial expressions to model communication behaviors. Conclusion

 Developing preverbal skills is a critical aspect of early childhood communication. Parents can take proactive steps to support their child's development by understanding their importance and recognizing potential delays or disorders.

 Early intervention can make a significant difference, paving the way for successful communication and overall well-being. As speech therapists, we advocate for awareness and early action to ensure every child has the opportunity to thrive in their communicative abilities.

Renal patients are still paying GH491 for dialysis treatment at Korle-Bu,"Renal patients across Ghana are conflicted following the government's announcement of a series of interventions for their dialysis treatment.

During GhanaWeb's visit to the Renal Unit of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, some renal patients expressed skepticism despite being happy with the government's initiative to subsidize their treatment.

All the patients interviewed by GhanaWeb stated that they are still required to pay GH491 per session for dialysis treatment, despite the government's announcement.

One patient, a 59-year-old woman, shared that she excitedly went to the Renal Unit for her session only to find out she still had to pay the GH491 fee per session.

She mentioned that she had to use all her available money and had no funds left for transportation back home.

Deborah Nortey, the Vice President of the Renal Patients Association of Ghana, Korle-Bu branch, who was present during GhanaWeb's visit, expressed gratitude to the government but also voiced concerns about the delay in implementing the interventions.

She highlighted that many members still struggle to come up with the GH491 required for a session of dialysis treatment, with some even having to return home due to lack of funds.

Nortey urged the government to ensure that all renal patients in the country have access to free dialysis treatment, as many are unable to work due to their conditions and the treatment's high cost.

While appreciative of the government's efforts, Nortey emphasized the need for further assistance, especially for those who do not qualify for free dialysis under the current scheme.

Other patients echoed similar sentiments, with some suggesting that dialysis treatment be included in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

A source at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital informed GhanaWeb that the interventions have not yet been implemented due to a lack of directives.

Less than a month ago, GhanaWeb reported on the distress experienced by renal patients following an increase in dialysis treatment costs. 

After public outcry, the government announced interventions, including free dialysis sessions for certain age groups and subsidised treatment for others.

"Rising non-communicable diseases in Accra: Cardiovascular issues leading cause of death among aged, middle-aged","Cases of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in Accra are on the rise, with cardiovascular ailments becoming a leading cause of death among the elderly and middle-aged populations. This concerning trend was revealed by Dr. Abena Okoh, the Metropolitan Director of Health Services.

Dr. Okoh pointed out that NCDs, particularly chronic respiratory diseases, are long-lasting conditions. She attributed the increase in these diseases to environmental pollution and unhealthy lifestyles, highlighting the critical need for preventive measures.

Hypertension: A Major Concern

Dr. Okoh disclosed that hypertension has been the fifth leading cause of death in Accra for three consecutive years, from 2021 to 2023. Health facilities in Accra recorded a total of 38,826 hypertension cases during this period, with 12,451 cases in 2021, 12,671 in 2022, and 13,704 in 2023.

Other NCDs on the Rise

Asthma was the second most common NCD, with cases increasing from 1,364 in 2021 to 2,112 in 2022, before slightly decreasing to 1,661 in 2023. Cardiac diseases also showed significant numbers, with 418 cases in 2021 and 249 in 2022. Stroke cases rose sharply from 187 in 2021 to 304 in 2022.

Environmental Pollution and Women's Health

Dr. Okoh emphasized the impact of environmental pollution on health, particularly in James Town, where many women are involved in fish smoking using firewood. This practice puts them at high risk of lung cancer and other chronic respiratory diseases. She encouraged these women to switch to clean cookstoves to reduce health risks.

Preventable Deaths

In the past three years, approximately 200 residents of Accra have died from cardiovascular diseases. Dr. Okoh assured that many deaths from NCDs are preventable. She urged communities and policymakers to take action to decrease environmental pollution and encourage healthier lifestyles.

Dr. Okoh's comments were in response to an Adom News report on the benefits of clean cookstoves, which many fishmongers find too expensive. She reiterated the importance of investing in such preventive tools to improve public health.

The significant increase in NCDs demands immediate action from both the government and the public to tackle the root causes and enhance the overall health and well-being of Accra's residents.",,Health,  7 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Rising-non-communicable-diseases-in-Accra-Cardiovascular-issues-leading-cause-of-death-among-aged-middle-aged-1934546
SSNIT contributors and pensioners to receive automatic NHIS card renewal notifications,"In a significant move to enhance healthcare accessibility, the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has announced that Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) contributors and pensioners will now receive automatic notifications on their phones when their National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) cards are renewed.

This new initiative, launched by the NHIA, aims to simplify the renewal process for NHIS cards, ensuring that SSNIT contributors and pensioners remain continuously covered without the hassle of manual renewals. 

The notifications will serve as a prompt, informing individuals that their NHIS membership has been automatically renewed.

The NHIAs decision has been met with widespread approval, particularly among the elderly and those reliant on the NHIS for their healthcare needs.

By eliminating the need for manual renewals, the NHIA is removing a significant barrier to accessing healthcare, especially for pensioners who may find the renewal process cumbersome.

""The health of our clients is our topmost priority,"" an NHIA representative stated. 

This initiative underscores the NHIAs commitment to improving the healthcare experience for its members, ensuring that they have uninterrupted access to medical services.

The integration of SSNIT and NHIS systems for automatic renewals is part of a broader strategy to leverage technology for better service delivery in the healthcare sector.

It reflects the NHIAs ongoing efforts to modernize its operations and provide a seamless experience for all NHIS members.

This development is expected to significantly benefit thousands of SSNIT contributors and pensioners, enhancing their peace of mind regarding their healthcare coverage. 

The NHIA encourages all members to ensure their contact information is up-to-date to receive these crucial notifications.

As this initiative rolls out, the NHIA plans to monitor its impact closely and make any necessary adjustments to further improve the service. 

The Authority remains dedicated to prioritizing the health and well-being of its members through continuous innovation and customer-focused strategies.",,Health,  6 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/SSNIT-contributors-and-pensioners-to-receive-automatic-NHIS-card-renewal-notifications-1934522
"MOH, GHS, WHO, others convene to tackle rising burden of non-communicable diseases","The Ministry of Health (MOH), Ghana Health Service (GHS), and other key stakeholders in the health sector convened a stakeholder engagement at the Alisa Hotel in Accra on June 5, 2024, to address the escalating issue of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Ghana.

The meeting, which focused on cardiovascular diseases, type 1 diabetes, and sickle cell disease, brought together a diverse group of participants to strategize on effective interventions.

The rising burden of NCDs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) poses a significant threat to Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Currently, NCDs account for approximately 70% of global mortality, with 80% of these deaths occurring in LMICs.

In Ghana, 45% of deaths are attributed to NCDs, and an additional 9% to injuries.

Alarmingly, six in ten Ghanaians suffer from hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or a combination of these conditions, highlighting a critical need for improved screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

The PEN-PLUS stakeholder meeting aimed to foster collaboration and drive impactful changes to combat these diseases.

Chaired by Dr. (Mrs.) Martha Gyansa-Lutterodt, former Director and Technical Coordinator of the Ministry of Health, the event included representatives from the GIZ Ghana Heart Initiative, World Health Organization (WHO), Sanofi Ghana, Diabetes Youth Care, Medtronic Labs, ICARE, CDiC, King Health, Clinton Health Access Initiative, Ghana Health Service, and other key organizations.

Juliette Edzeame, Project Manager of the GIZ Ghana Heart Initiative, highlighted the initiative's milestones since its launch in 2019, emphasizing its role in strengthening the management of cardiovascular diseases in Ghana.

""The GHI has achieved many milestones to sustainably strengthen the Ghanaian health system in regard to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) management,"" she asserted.

Yaa Bimpeh Amoah, a clinic nurse and leader of the Sonia Nabeta Foundation, underscored the foundation's vision of ensuring that children with type 1 diabetes lead long, healthy, and productive lives.

""We believe in a Ghana where children with type 1 diabetes have an equal chance at long, healthy, productive, and gainful lives.""

Similarly, a representative from Diabetes Youth Care stressed the importance of bridging the gap between young diabetes patients and medical personnel through education and support.

A key discussion point was the introduction of the DCARD and WHO PEN-PLUS projects. PEN-PLUS is an integrated strategy designed to enhance the quality of services for severe chronic NCDs at primary referral facilities, such as district hospitals.

It focuses on severe NCDs, including type 1 diabetes, rheumatic heart disease, sickle cell disease, and palliative care for advanced malignancies.

The strategy includes training and mentorship for health workers and strengthening health facilities with necessary equipment and supplies.

Dr. Joyce Ansong, NCDs Program Lead at the WHO Ghana Country Office, emphasized the urgent need for action to tackle NCDs, which are crucial for achieving UHC and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa.

""NCDs have become a significant public health challenge in Africa, requiring urgent, continuous, and substantial action. NCDs are crucial to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and SDGs in Africa and globally. It's time to act and act now!

WHO PEN, HEARTS, and PEN-Plus are cost-effective solutions and key to achieving SDG target 3.4 and UHC targets. Acting now will not only save millions of lives today but also ensure a healthier region for future generations,"" she said.

The meeting concluded with a commitment to convene another session to strategize the implementation of the inputs discussed.

Dr. Mavis Sakyi from the Ministry of Health recommended that all suggestions be put into action to optimize resource allocation and effectiveness in addressing NCDs in Ghana.

In her closing remarks, Dr. (Mrs.) Martha Gyansa-Lutterodt acknowledged the challenges in coordination but expressed confidence in the Ministry of Health's ability to re-engineer and reorganize efforts to maintain momentum.

""Coordination is a key issue, and I believe the Ministry of Health will re-engineer and reorganize to ensure that we can keep the momentum and move forward.

""The data research and all the topics we discussed today require the involvement of other strategic stakeholders in the next steps.

Access Bank deepens commitment to end obstetric fistula,"Access Bank (Ghana) Plc has reiterated its continued commitment to eradicating obstetric fistula in Ghana. 

In 2018, the bank launched a campaign against fistula dubbed Fist Against Fistula with a 10-kilometer walk across the country to raise awareness of the debilitating condition affecting mothers after childbirth. 

Underscoring the need to restore dignity to women living with the condition and reintegrate them into society, Managing Director of Access Bank (Ghana) Plc, Olumide Olatunji said Our strategic goal is to become a flag bearer of sustainable businesses and one of the ways we can do this is by committing resources to build an empowered and healthy citizenry that can participate meaningfully in the economic development of Ghana and Africa at large. 

Speaking at the 2024 International Day to End Obstetric Fistula (IDEOF), the Head of Corporate Communications and Brand Management, Oluwaseun David-Akindele said

Childbirth is a glorious moment and should not be marred with after-birth issues that only push women into hiding. It is now time to collaborate with a lot more stakeholders to intensify advocacy against stigma, raise awareness, and attract funds to finance more surgeries for affected women and girls. 

Obstetric fistula remains one of the most devastating childbirth injuries predominantly found among women and girls living in remote communities without access to emergency obstetric care. It is estimated that globally, about 500,000 women and girls are living with fistula with new cases being recorded annually. 

Ghana's statistics reveal a worrying 1,300 annual record of cases, predominantly from the Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Central, and Savannah regions. 

Present at the IDEOF were the First Lady of the Republic of Ghana, Rebecca Akuffo Addo; the Norwegian Ambassador to Ghana, H.E. Ingrid Mollestad; and the Country Representative for UNFPA, Dr Wilfred Ochan. 

Partnership

The bank has so far contributed to close to 200 fistula repairs in Ghana making it the largest single contributor to the fight against Fistula. This initiative is under the Banks Women Empowerment Programme, W initiative. 

To accelerate fistula repairs and integration of women and girls affected with fistula, the Partnerships to End Obstetric Fistula in Ghana (PEFIG) was launched with Access Bank as a key member along with other notable partners including United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of The First Lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection, The Fistula Task Force, Ghana Health Service, the Media and Communication Advocacy Network (MCAN), among others.

Access Bank is spearheading the fight and involving other key stakeholders to drive its ""Fist against Fistula Campaign,"" as part of its larger objective to support Ghana in meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in response to the high incidence of fistula cases in the country. 

This year, under PEFIG, Access Bank Ghana will partner with Chango, a crowd-funding platform to raise funds to continue to support the repairs and reintegration of women and girls affected by obstetric fistula.

Free dialysis for kidney patients under 18 and over 60 not sustainable  Akandoh,"Ranking Member of Parliaments Health Committee, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has expressed skepticism about the sustainability of the National Health Insurance Authoritys (NHIA) recent initiative to provide free dialysis sessions for certain age groups.

 From Saturday, June 1, through December 2024, the NHIA will offer eight free dialysis sessions per month to kidney patients under 18 and over 60 years old.

 Additionally, patients aged 19 to 59 will receive two free sessions per month.

 Despite the initiative's positive reception, Mr. Akandoh believes the government should focus on subsidising dialysis fees rather than providing free sessions.

 Speaking to the media, Mr. Akandoh stressed the need for a sustainable approach to funding dialysis treatment in Ghana.

 The patients deserve better, and the government can come in [to help]. If you look at the payment or the purchase of vaccines, sometimes the National Health Insurance pays something and the government will also come in to pay counterpart funding, so this is not sustainable, Mr. Akandoh stated.

 Highlighting the temporary nature of the initiative, he added, It is only for six months, and it is so because we are in the election period. All this while, we have not heard the vice president speak about this. It is political because after December, there is no plan, so you go back to paying what you used to pay. And in actual fact, it has increased from GHS380 to GHS491.",,Health,  5 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Free-dialysis-for-kidney-patients-under-18-and-over-60-not-sustainable-Akandoh-1934298
Pregnancy and Air Pollution: Health experts warn of increased autism risk in babies,"After giving birth to two healthy boys, it never crossed Mary Amoah Kuffours mind that her only daughter could have a medical condition. Nana Yaa began exhibiting unusual behaviour at the young age of three. She barely spoke and would flap her hands in a strange ritual when frustrated.

Year after year, Mary tried to find explanations for her daughters behavior. When Nana Yaa turned six, doctors finally broke the news to her mother: Nana Yaa had autism.

Autism is a medical condition that affects brain development and cognitive abilities. It runs on a spectrum from mild to severe and affects one in every hundred children according to the World Health Organisation. The condition has no known cause but, sadly, in Ghana like many parts of the world, children with autism are often tagged as spiritual children or products of witchcraft.

It comes as a shock, especially when you ask if theres something you could do. Do they have any medications? Because you dont see any visible signs on the child to say that he or she has any form of disability and so for this to be termed as a disability its shocking, says Mary. When you ask and they tell you theres no cure, nobody wants to hear that.


Nana Yaa learns basic life skills with her teacher

Afi Antonio, founder of the Afi Antonio Foundation which works with children with autism, is working hard to break that stigma. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of a range of neurological disorders that impact one in every ten children but the level of awareness is low in many parts of the world including Ghana. 

When I started, some people were like, Afi, you are yet to have children so be careful associating with these children so you dont have a child like that, recalls Antonio. 

Which is really sad that people will even think that way because autism is not contagious. A lot also say that they are cursed children. As at now, we still have people who kill their children when they are born with these conditions.

Most of those, like Nana Yaa, who benefit from early intervention, go on to live full and happy lives. Indeed some traits of ASD have been connected to genius. 

Some of the worlds most brilliant thinkers have autism and many experts believe that acclaimed scholars such as Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton had ASD.

Many of them will do well, it depends on what you do for them especially early on in life. If they get the therapy early, get all the support early, they are able to do generally well and become productive adults, says Dr. Hilda Mantebea Boye, a childcare specialist at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.

Though there is no clear cause for autism, researchers in the U.S. and Sweden have found a link between air pollution exposure during pregnancy and an increased risk of the condition in babies.

Dangerous toxins in the air called fine particulate matter, seep into the bloodstream of pregnant mothers and can affect the brain development of the baby at key stages.

New Narratives  PREGNANCY AND AIR POLLUTION: Health experts warn of increased autism risk in babies

 
Dr. Sefogah is an Obstetrician-Gynecologist at the Shape Healthcare Medical Center

During the first trimester, certain environmental exposures affect various parts of the babys formation, says Dr. Promise Sefogah, an Obstetrician-Gynecologist at the Shape Healthcare Medical Center. 

When the woman gets exposed to pollutants in the air, they tend to affect the brain-related development or the nervous system development of the baby and that can lead to a lot of brain-related abnormalities in the baby.

Beyond affecting intellectual abilities, children with autism can be more vulnerable to air pollution, causing allergies and sensory problems. Health experts say air pollution, particularly from activities like open burning and vehicular emissions, also exposes children to the risk of other serious cognitive and brain development problems. 


Fati Fuseini, with her young son, is a trader at the Agbogbloshie market

Despite efforts by the government of Ghana to tackle air pollution and improve air quality in the country, the problem is getting worse. Accra is Africas fastest-growing city and with the rapid increase in population has come an increase in open burning, transport and factory emissions  the key drivers of poor air quality. In places like Agbogbloshie, one of Ghanas biggest informal settlements, pollution from open-air burning activities is rife.


Open-burning activities going on at the Agbogbloshie landfill site

The burning of waste at the landfill site near the market, and the use of tyres by scrap scavengers to burn electronic waste products, leave residents and traders constantly inhaling dirty air that leaves them sick. 

My children complain about the smoke in this area. They are not happy, says Fati Fuseini, a trader at Agbogbloshie market with three young children. They are not able to stay and sleep over when they come here, they leave for their fathers.


A scene from the Agbogbloshie landfill site

Government has put in place plans to embark on public awareness campaigns in Agbogloshie, to provide a drop-off point for discarding waste electronics, and promote the separation of plastics to facilitate recycling as part of efforts to tackle the situation.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other stakeholders are also monitoring air quality in highly polluted areas including Agbogloshie to alert Ghanaians about the dangerous levels of pollution on a daily basis. They are reviewing air quality management regulations and working on a plan to tackle road transport pollution, particularly from minibuses, known as trotros, in the capital, Accra.

While the government does its part, health experts say highly polluted places are a no-go area for pregnant women but if they must, they should always wear nose masks to protect themselves and their babies from the risks of air pollution.

GH4.35m cant provide free dialysis over 6 months  CDD fellow challenges NHIS,"Pharmacist and Fellow at CDD-GHANA, Dr. Kwame Asiedu Sarpong, has disputed the National Health Insurance Schemes (NHIS) claim of having the financial muscle to offer six months of free dialysis sessions to vulnerable individuals suffering kidney diseases in Ghana.

Per the social intervention, Government through the NHIS is absorbing the cost of 8 dialysis sessions every month for each renal patient aged below eighteen and above 65 years.

The intervention will further cater for two dialysis sessions for a hundred and forty-seven patients aged between 18 and 59 in all public hospitals offering dialysis services except for the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital where a philanthropist is subsidizing the cost for patients.

According to Dr Asiedu Sarpong, patients below eighteen and above 65 stands at 73 beneficiaries, representing less than ten per cent of the 1034 persons on renal dialysis course in Ghana.

He noted that to cater for the entire 73 patients alone, the government would need GH7,455,344 million.

Speaking on Abusua Nkommo with Kojo Marfo, Dr. Sarpong described the NHISs calculations as inaccurate.

Dr Sarpong explained, The Fees and Charges committee in Parliament has stated that the cost of dialysis per session is GH491. The NHIS claims to perform eight dialysis sessions per month for the remaining 73 patients, which means these patients would visit the machines 584 times per month.

The six months of free service claimed by NHIS calculated in weeks is equivalent to 26 weeks. Multiplying this by the number of monthly sessions (584), we get a total sum of 15,184 sessions.

""To determine the actual money needed to offer free service, Dr. Sarpong multiplied the total number of sessions (15,184) by parliament's approved fees and charges of GH491 cedis to arrive at a figure of GH7,455,344.

According to Dr. Sarpong, the amount of GH2million approved by Parliament for NHIS can only cover six and a half weeks of dialysis for the most vulnerable 73 renal dialysis patients.

He also noted that NHIS would need an additional GH5.5 million to cater for their required six months of free service.

Dr. Sarpong stated, If you subtract the approved Parliament money of GH2 million from the amount they will need to cater for the six months of dialysis, which is almost GH7.5 million, there is a shortfall of GH5.5 million.",,Health,  5 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/GH-4-35m-can-t-provide-free-dialysis-over-6-months-CDD-fellow-challenges-NHIS-1934201
NHIA and NIA collaborate to register children under 15 years,"The collaboration between the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and the National Identification Authority (NIA) of Ghana marks a significant milestone in advancing healthcare coverage and national identification for the countrys youth. 

Through a joint cooperative agreement, the two authorities have set the stage for a targeted registration drive scheduled to kick off on June 10, 2024. 

This initiative specifically aims at registering children aged 6 to 14 years nationwide, with the goal of issuing them Ghana cards. 

These cards will not only grant access to healthcare services under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) but also provide official identification through the NIA.

By equipping young individuals with Ghana cards at an early stage, the initiative spearheaded by NHIA and NIA strives to enhance the youths access to crucial healthcare services while simultaneously easing their involvement in various socio-economic activities that mandate official identification. 

The collaborative efforts between the two government agencies underscore Ghanas commitment to streamlining administrative processes and broadening the reach of social services. The agenda behind this joint registration drive contributes to a more inclusive society by emphasizing the vital role of healthcare access and identity recognition for the Ghanaian youth.

At a second phase training session currently underway at Winneba for staff from the middle and northern belts of the National Health Insurance Authority, representatives from NHIA and NIA highlighted the importance of universal healthcare coverage and the essential role of ensuring every childs access to fundamental services in Ghana. 

The  NHIA Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Operations, Mrs Louisa Atta-Agyemang emphasized the significance of this partnership in extending healthcare access and laying a foundation for a more inclusive and empowered community. 

Echoing this sentiment, the National Identification Authority Executive Secretary, Dr. Kenneth Agyeman Attafuah, stressed the Ghana cards function as a pivotal instrument for identity verification and access to public services, especially for children in the demographic of 6 to 14 years.

The anticipated joint registration drive, scheduled to commence on June 10, 2024, will establish registration centers in schools nationwide to facilitate the process. 

Encouraging active involvement from parents and guardians, the authorities urge them to ensure their children partake in the registration to obtain the crucial Ghana card, securing their pathway to essential healthcare services. 

This initiative not only signals a progressive step towards comprehensive healthcare coverage and national identification for Ghanas youth but also highlights the governments dedication to fostering a more inclusive and empowered society where every childs rights and recognition are safeguarded.", Lydia Adjei-Tutu,Health,  4 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NHIA-and-NIA-collaborate-to-register-children-under-15-years-1934034
Compliance with blood pressure medications: A vital step in stroke prevention,"One of the main causes of mortality and disability in the world is stroke; however, many of these instances can be avoided with appropriate treatment of high blood pressure, or hypertension. 

People who are taking blood pressure drugs must carefully follow their treatment regimens. 

Because it usually does not show any signs until serious harm has been done, hypertension is sometimes referred to as the ""silent killer."" By maintaining blood pressure within a safe range, regularly taking prescribed medicines can greatly lower the risk of stroke. This lessens the workload on the heart while also shielding the arteries from harm.

A prevalent problem is non-compliance with drug regimens. While some people may experience negative effects or forget to take their prescription, others may stop taking it because they feel great. On the other hand, stopping or suddenly taking blood pressure medicine can cause severe blood pressure increases, which raises the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems. 

It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of routine medical exams. During these visits, medical professionals can check blood pressure, change prescriptions as needed, and handle any issues or side effects. 

Furthermore, healthy lifestyle choices like stopping smoking, maintaining a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and consuming less alcohol all enhance the benefits of medicine.

Campaigns for education and community awareness may be quite effective in promoting compliance. Patients should have discussions with pharmacists and other healthcare professionals on the advantages of adhering to their drug regimens and get helpful advice for maintaining their health. 

In the end, following a doctor's prescription for blood pressure medicine is a straightforward yet effective way to prevent fatal strokes and their crippling effects. Let us commit to a healthy future by ensuring we adhere to our doctor's recommendations and keep lines of communication open with them.", Simon Badu,Health,  3 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Compliance-with-blood-pressure-medications-A-vital-step-in-stroke-prevention-1933973
NHIS announces free dialysis for kidney patients,"Starting June 1, 2024, through December 2024, individuals who are under 18 and over 60 years of age and suffering from kidney diseases will be eligible for eight free dialysis sessions monthly, this is according to the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

This initiative, revealed by the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), celebrates the scheme's 20th anniversary.

The Acting Chief Executive Officer of NHIA, Dr. Da-Costa Aboagye, confirmed in a statement that this effort is part of the anniversary festivities.

An amount of GH2,000,000.00 has been sanctioned by the government of Ghana and approved by parliament, as outlined in the NHIA's 2024 Allocation Formula.

The aim is to assist the financially-challenged and vulnerable patients in need of dialysis treatments.

In addition, the NHIA has dedicated an extra GH2,400,000.00 from its Corporate Social Responsibility budget, approved for the scheme, to further support this significant health intervention.

As part of NHIAs 20th Anniversary, the NHIA, through administrative arrangements has allocated an additional GH2,400,000.00, under the Corporate Social Responsibility approved budget of the scheme to support this initiative, the statement said.

The report also stated that following the verification of patients currently undergoing dialysis, the monthly cost for those within the specified categories is estimated at GH329,952. 

By the conclusion of December 2024, the total expenditure is anticipated to reach approximately GH2.3 million.

The statement also detailed that patients between the ages of 18 and 59 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Efia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, Ho Teaching Hospital, and Tamale Teaching Hospital, excluding those at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), will be granted a subsidy. 

This subsidy will cover two dialysis sessions per month, amounting to GH982.00 in total, which equates to GH491 per session.

The cost of dialysis for this treatment category is projected to be GH144,354 per month and by the end of December 2024, the cumulative cost is estimated to be approximately GH1.01 million, it added.

The statement clarified that patients at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) are eligible for a subsidy covering two dialysis sessions each month. 

The cost per session is GH245.50, which is 50 percent of the standard session price of GH491.00. 

This reduction is possible thanks to a philanthropic contribution of GH380.00 per patient, aimed at ensuring cost equity across all medical facilities.

For this group of patients at KBTH, the monthly cost of dialysis is expected to be GH147,300. 

By the end of December 2024, the total cost is projected to reach approximately GH1.03 million, the statement said.

The Government is committed to finding sustainable interventions to dealing with renal diseases and other illnesses not currently covered under the NHIS in a holistic manner, and will soon unveil a sustainable plan, the statement concluded.

FHUC 'Pads Up A Girl' in commemoration of World Menstrual Hygiene Day,"On the occasion of Menstrual Hygiene Day 2024, the Family Health University College, which comprises the Family Health Hospital, Medical School, and Nursing & Midwifery Schools, donated over 1,500 packets of sanitary pads to students from the Ledzokuku Municipal Authority (LEKMA) Southern Cluster of Schools.  

This gesture according to the President of the Family Health Medical Students Association, Abeeku Zuriel Idun, is to mitigate the distress some girls go through during their menstrual periods.

Menstrual Hygiene Day, observed worldwide on 28th May each year, is a day dedicated to raising awareness about the difficulties women and girls face during menstruation. 

Various stakeholders, including health professionals, gender activists, educators, NGOs, and conscientious citizens, strive to provide education and support to eradicate period poverty and its detrimental effects. 

The theme for this year is Together for a period-friendly World, which envisions a world free from the stigma and taboos associated with menstruation.

At the event which was held at the Presbyterian Church Hall, Teshie, the LEKMA Municipal Director of Education, Mrs. Theresa Tetteh, emphasized the need for more support for girls to manage their periods safely and confidently. 

She expressed her gratitude to the Family Health University College and urged other organizations, donors, and the public to follow suit and support girls in underprivileged communities who struggle to access menstrual products. 

Dr. Gifty Ofori Ansah, the LEKMA Health Director, called for prioritizing menstrual hygiene policy in the governments Girl Child Education agenda. 

She encouraged girls to seek professional help and guidance from their counsellors and teachers about menstrual hygiene challenges.

Dr. Naa Adorkor Sodzi-Tettey, a lecturer, and Clinical Coordinator at the Family Health Medical School, educated the girls about menstruation and safe practices. 

She emphasized that menstruation is a natural and normal process and should not be stigmatised.  

She called on the LEKMA Municipal Director of Education to prioritise and improve washroom facilities.  

""We cannot educate girls every year to change their pads regularly and wash their hands after changing when there is no decent place in the school for doing that: no privacy, no water, no soap she said.  

She called for innovative and sustainable solutions for a period-friendly world for our girls. She told the students that there is no shame in using reusable materials for their periods if the reusables are washed very well, dried, and reused.  

She demonstrated the use of a reusable menstrual product that is being produced by some entrepreneurs and NGOs and encouraged their patronage. 



In conclusion, the event was a success, with over 600 girls from seventeen Junior and Senior High Schools from the LEKMA Southern Cluster of Schools benefiting from the interaction with the staff and students of Family Health University College on acceptable menstrual practices. 

The students expressed their gratitude for the sanitary pads and the education they received.", William Sarpong,Health,  1 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/FHUC-Pads-Up-A-Girl-in-commemoration-of-World-Menstrual-Hygiene-Day-1933646
Dr Yaa-Pokuaa Baiden lauds women health promotion agenda,"The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Administration and Human Resources, Dr. Yaa Pokuaa Baiden (Mrs.) says womens access to equitable healthcare is a fundamental human right.

She thus advocates a collective call to action to develop comprehensive strategies for womens health access.

She was addressing the 2nd Africa Womens Health Summit held in Accra under the theme, A New Dawn of Partnership for Womens Health.

In her keynote address, Dr. Yaa Pokuaa Baiden (Mrs.) reiterated the need for a renewed synergies between healthcare institutions, the development community and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to realizing the vision of a world where every woman can live a healthy, dignified, and fulfilling life.

To the private sector and NGOs, let us leverage our collective resources to ensure affordability and equitable distribution of essential medicines. Together, by fostering our culture of innovation and collaboration, we can create a future where access to essential medicines and vaccines is not a privilege but a fundamental human right for all women in Ghana. When women have access to quality healthcare, they are empowered to live healthier lives, contribute more fully to their communities, and build a brighter future for themselves and the families. 

I can assure you that the National Health Insurance Authority remains steadfast in its commitment to womens health. We are confident that through continued innovation, we can improve the health of all.

To our fellow healthcare institutions, let us share best practices and jointly develop comprehensive strategies for womens health access. To the research and development community, let us work together to accelerate innovative solutions for women-specific healthcare needs.

She highlighted financing womens healthcare, healthcare financing models that suit women, innovative ways which Ghanas National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has employed to increase access to medicines for women in Ghana, the role of public-private collaboration to effectively increase access to women's health products, potential partnerships between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and non-profit organizations to drive innovation.

She said, Our focus today is on the innovative approaches employed by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to increase access to medicines and vaccines for women across the nation. Through visionary policies, strategic partnerships, and community-centred initiatives, NHIS has emerged as a trailblazer in the quest for universal healthcare coverage and gender-sensitive healthcare delivery.

We at NHIA recognize that better health is intrinsically linked to prosperity, and womens well-being is central to achieving sustainable development.

Dr. Yaa Pokuaa Baiden (Mrs.) delved into some innovative strategies implemented by the National Health Insurance Authority to enhance access to essential medicines and vaccines for women nationwide.

She referenced the introduction of free maternal care, inclusion of Breast and Cervical cancer treatment to the NHIS Benefit Package, inclusion of Family Planning Services and Partnerships as a model to facilitate access to medicines.

Touching on the specifics, she expatiated, Among the pioneering initiatives spearheaded by the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), perhaps none is more emblematic of innovation and impact than the provision of free maternal care. This groundbreaking intervention stands as a testament to NHIA unwavering commitment to ensuring that no woman is left behind in the journey towards safer pregnancies and healthier futures. Under the umbrella of free maternal care, NHIS has dismantled financial barriers that once hindered access to essential healthcare services for pregnant women across the nation.

By covering the cost of antenatal care including routine antenatal medications and medications for managing complications of pregnancy such as eclampsia, postnatal care, and emergency obstetric care, NHIS has transformed the landscape of maternal health, making quality healthcare a reality for women from all walks of life.

This innovative approach not only saves lives but also embodies the principles of equity, dignity, and social justice. By removing the financial burden of maternal healthcare, NHIS empowers women to seek timely and appropriate care during pregnancy and childbirth, reducing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. furthermore, free maternal care serves as a powerful catalyst for improving women's health outcomes beyond the maternal period. To ensure that women receive comprehensive healthcare services throughout pregnancy and childbirth, NHIS lays the foundation for lifelong health and well-being, not only for mothers but also for their children and families.

She underscored the importance of the inclusion of breast cancer treatment and a specialist anti breast cancer expensive drug called Herceptin to the NHIS Benefit Package, which has so far benefited over  thousand (1000) women, suffering from that disease condition.

In 2018, the Ministry of Health signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Roche to work together to fight breast cancer in Ghana. This culminated in the signing of a supply contract that reduced the cost of Herceptin by 70 percent. thereby, allowing the inclusion of the treatment of breast and cervical cancers to the benefit package, an innovative initiative by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) underscoring its commitment to women's health.

This visionary step represents a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to combat two of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer affecting women in Ghana and beyond. By expanding the NHIS benefit package to encompass treatment for breast and cervical cancers, NHIS has not only saved lives but also transformed the landscape of cancer care in the country. For countless women diagnosed with these devastating diseases, access to life-saving treatments such as chemotherapy, and surgical interventions is no longer a distant dream but a tangible reality, thanks to the NHIS.

She added, Prior to this partnership, less than 10 HER2+ breast cancer patients in a year could complete treatment. However, since July 2019, when Herceptin was first made available through the NHIS, approximately a 1,000 Ghanaian patients have been able to access this innovative treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer, thanks to the foresight and dedication of NHIA. This represents a profound leap forward in cancer care, offering hope and healing to those facing a diagnosis once considered insurmountable. The NHIA has saved over $ 19 million through this partnership. This approach to cancer care does not only address the immediate healthcare needs of affected women but also addresses the broader systemic challenges that have long hindered access to quality cancer treatment in Ghana.

Herceptin, the brand name of Trastuzumab + Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase, is a breakthrough medication used in the treatment of breast, oesophageal, and stomach cancers. Its inclusion in the NHIS benefit package represents a significant milestone in the ongoing fight against cancer, particularly HER2-positive breast cancer, a subtype known for its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. The inclusion of breast and cervical cancer treatment in the NHIS benefit package reflects a commitment to gender-sensitive healthcare delivery and a recognition of the unique health needs and vulnerabilities of women.

By prioritizing these critical healthcare services, NHIA is taking a decisive step towards closing the gap in cancer care and ensuring that all women can receive timely and appropriate treatment, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location, Dr Yaa Pokuaa reaffirmed. 

She touted the inclusion of Family Planning Services to the NHIS Benefit Package saying, The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) championed family planning as a vital component of women's health and empowerment. Recognizing the pivotal role of family planning in advancing reproductive rights, improving maternal and child health outcomes, and promoting gender equality, the NHIS in 2021 included Family planning in its benefit package.

Through its network of credentialed healthcare providers, NHIS offers a comprehensive range of contraceptive methods, including injectables, implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and tubal ligation at no cost to beneficiaries. By taking up the cost of family planning NHIS ensures that women from all socioeconomic backgrounds have access to a wide spectrum of contraceptive options, empowering them to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and well-being.

She lauded strategic partnerships as a model to facilitate access to medicines. 

Creation of partnerships between local and foreign pharmaceutical firms has also proven to aid in the acquisition and access to medicines. We must, here, be grateful to such partners as they move away from profit-driven motives to efforts at addressing health equities. This can be seen in the areas of vaccine production and anti-malarias. In so doing remedies to tackle diseases that disproportionately affect women and usually children in developing countries like ours are found. Through these partnerships, essential medicines are not only developed but also made accessible through sustainable distribution channels. The involvement of various stakeholders, including the NHIS ensures that these medicines reach those who need them most. The NHIA has been instrumental in the acquisition of vaccines in country. In 2022 the authority purchased for the Ministry of Health vaccines worth 71 million Ghana Cedis for distribution countrywide.

Dr. Yaa Pokuaa talked about medications on the NHIS medicines list in generic forms.

In its relentless pursuit of equitable healthcare access, the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has embraced a transformative strategy: the inclusion of medications in their generic names on the medicines list. This seemingly simple yet profoundly impactful approach represents a paradigm shift in pharmaceutical procurement and prescribing practices, with far-reaching implications for women's health and well-being across the nation. By prioritizing generic medications over brand-name equivalents, NHIA has not only reduced healthcare costs but also expanded access to essential medicines for women from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Generic medications, which are bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts but typically more affordable, offer a cost-effective solution to the rising burden of out-of-pocket healthcare expenses faced by many Ghanaian families.

This innovative approach not only enhances access to essential medicines for women but also fosters a culture of stewardship and sustainability within the healthcare system. By optimizing resource allocation and promoting the use of cost-effective medications, NHIS maximizes the impact of limited healthcare funds, ensuring that every Ghanaian woman can access the medications she needs to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.

She called for tactical Public-Private-Partnership in the journey towards creating a better, healthier future for women everywhere.

As we celebrate the progress made in improving women's health, we must also acknowledge the critical importance of sustained investment in healthcare infrastructure, workforce training, and research to further advance women's health outcomes. African governments can enter into financing agreements with banks/ financial institutions to procure expensive medical and diagnostic equipment in that direction. 

While we have made significant strides in recent years, much work remains to be done to address the complex and multifaceted healthcare needs of women across the globe. I believe we can achieve this through a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) health financing model.

Dr. Yaa Pokuaa Baiden (Mrs.) celebrated female continuous dominance in the NHIS active membership ratings saying, Official data in 2019 indicated that female members dominated active membership of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) with a national outlook of 58.6 per cent against 41.4 per cent males. From the 2022 National census it indicated that health insurance coverage for women was 90 per cent, an increment from 40 per cent reported for women in the 2008 report.

With these figures, it is evident that the National Health Insurance Scheme cannot be truly effective without tailored solutions aimed at addressing women's specific health needs.

The 2nd Africa Womens Health Summit was spearheaded by a Pan-African consulting firm in Africa known as the Africa Health Business (AHB), in collaboration with Roche, Healthcare Federation Ghana and MSD.

Despite significant global and regional efforts to reduce tobacco use, West Africa continues to see troubling trends in smoking rates among its youth. According to the recent ""Situational Analysis on Policy Framework for Tobacco Control in West Africa,"" conducted by researchers for the Youth Bridge Foundation tobacco use remains a prevalent habit with severe health implications. Nearly 20% of young people aged 13-15 use some form of tobacco, and many begin smoking at a very young age of 10.

The report underscores the importance of robust governmental support and the implementation of comprehensive tobacco control policies. While international frameworks like the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) provide valuable guidelines, the absence of a unified policy framework for West Africa highlights the need for cohesive and coordinated action across the region. Strengthening these policies is vital to effectively combat tobacco use and protect future generations.

Our Initiative

To mark World No Tobacco Day, the Youth Advisory Board of Youth Bridge Foundation, with support from Youth in Action and Amref Health Africa in Kenya are organizing an awareness event at the Accra Sports Stadium under the global theme Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference with localized theme Clear Lungs Clear Goals to press on the message of winning in sporting competition and at the same time having a healthy life. 

Ghanas hosting of the 2024 All African Games has created the sporting euphoria and we are aligning with the healthy sport lifestyle. This event will involve youth sportsmen and women, leveraging their influence to spread the message about the dangers of tobacco use. Our goal is to tap into the Ghanaian sports league to reduce substance use among players and encourage healthier lifestyles.

Call to Action

It is crucial to support and implement policies that restrict tobacco advertising, increase taxes on tobacco products, and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors. 

1.	We urge the government to strengthen tobacco control policies in line with WHO FCTC guidelines and enhance collaboration among stakeholders.
2.	Enacting specific policies for electronic smoking including Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems

Furthermore, we call on:

3.	Young people to support each other in rejecting tobacco and to promote positive peer pressure. 

4.	Parents to empower their wards to confidently say ""no"" to tobacco without fear of intimidation. Parents should encourage their children to defy orders or tobacco-related errands assertively. Building this confidence at home will help young people make healthier choices and resist peer pressure and coercion.",,Health, 31 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Youth-Bridge-Foundation-partners-Y-ACT-and-AMREF-Africa-to-raise-awareness-on-tobacco-use-among-the-youth-1933504
Consumer Protection Agency commends FDA for crackdown on 'fake' diapers,"The Consumer Protection Agency (CPA) has lauded the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) for their decisive action in removing defective and low-quality diapers from the market, commonly referred to as ""fake diapers."" 

These substandard products have raised significant health concerns among consumers, particularly affecting infants.

The CPA conducted extensive research across several markets in Ghana, revealing that many of these diapers failed microbial tests. 

Investigations uncovered that these diapers are often rejected during production in their home countries, intended for destruction but instead sold cheaply and imported into Ghana.

The CPA's findings highlighted that these rejected diapers, often found among the trash, are contaminated even before they are repackaged into plain polyethylene bags and shipped.

The unsanitary conditions in which they are stored exacerbate the contamination, leading to high failure rates in microbial tests.

The CPA's research, which spanned five regionsGreater Accra, Kumasi, Tamale, Sefwi Wiawso, and Sunyaniwas prompted by numerous complaints from mothers about skin rashes and discomfort in their children after using certain diapers. 

The Executive Director of CPA, Kofi Kapito, speaking at a press conference in Accra, said the study found that many infants suffered from severe nappy rashes and infections around the anus and genitalia, which, if left untreated, could become fatal.

In light of these findings, the CPA is urging all Ghanaians, especially mothers, to cease using these products immediately to protect their children from further harm. 

Additionally, the CPA is calling on the Commissioner of the Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) to take immediate action to halt the importation of these defective diapers into Ghana.

""Matters of paediatrics are critically important as infants and children are the most vulnerable,"" the CPA emphasized in their statement.

The CPA expressed its readiness to partner with the FDA in a nationwide campaign to raise awareness about these unsafe diapers and address other consumer safety issues. 

The agency reiterated its commitment to working collaboratively with the FDA to enhance consumer protection in Ghana.

Once again, the CPA highly commends the FDA for its efforts in cracking down on these hazardous products, ensuring the safety and well-being of consumers across the country.",,Health, 31 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Consumer-Protection-Agency-commends-FDA-for-crackdown-on-fake-diapers-1933478
Effutu: Birth date of Afenyo-Markin made Hepatitis B Campaign Day,"After several years of helping to deal with hepatitis B in Effutu and Ghana at large, Member of Parliament for the Effutu Constituency, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, has been honored by the Mumbies Foundation and his constituents.

As part of the honor, May 27, which is the birth date of the lawmaker, has been earmarked for a hepatitis B campaign and screening exercise in the Effutu municipality.

Afenyo-Markin, through the non-profit organization, has for the past years invested a lot in hepatitis B screening and treatment in Effutu and beyond.

Many constituents have benefited from the numerous activities held to ensure everyone gets screened and also offered treatment opportunities to help deal with the problem.

Projects Manager for Mumbies Foundation Ghana, Israel Adorbley, indicated that every May 27 will be an awareness day for the fight against the disease and urged constituents to take advantage of the initiative to get screened to check their status.

He commended the MP for his continuous support in ensuring the constituents have access to hepatitis B testing and treatment without having to go through a lot of challenges.

Hepatitis B has been one of the major diseases in the country, with the cost of treatment very high, a situation that makes it difficult for people to raise funds to take care of themselves.

Some constituents and beneficiaries who spoke to the media were grateful for the MP's intervention and pledged to retain him in the upcoming parliamentary polls.

Meanwhile, Afenyo-Markin, as part of his birthday celebration, donated a television set and toiletries to inmates of the Winneba Local Prisons.

Unchain our girls from sex for menstrual hygiene essentials - Dr. Otiko Afisah Djaba to gov't,"The Henry Djaba Memorial Foundation has called on the government to take action and free girls from the exchange of sex for menstrual hygiene essentials.

 In celebration of this year's Menstrual Hygiene Day, Dr. Otiko Afisah Djaba expressed pride in the foundation's incredible journey, achievements, and the lives of girls who have experienced and are still experiencing menstruation.

 ""Indeed, the ability to menstruate is a badge of honor that symbolizes the beginning of puberty, womanhood, and motherhood.

 ""Girls should be happy to understand that there is nothing dirty or shameful about having our monthly flow.

 ""We seize this special day, 28th May 2024, to call on the Government to enforce their political will and to duty bearers, parents, men, and boys to take serious action to unchain our girls from sex for menstrual hygiene essentials,"" she said in a press release.

 She believes that World Menstrual Hygiene Day raises awareness of the importance of good menstrual hygiene practices and highlights the challenges faced by women and girls in managing their periods, especially in low-income, poverty-stricken homes where money for daily feeding is a problem, access to clean water is poor, and sanitation and hygienic products are limited.

 ""For as little as GHC10.00, the cost of the cheapest sanitary towels on the market, some girls will sleep with an unscrupulous boy or man in exchange for this pittance, while others are pushed by parents into prostitution for basic needs.

 ""Hearing of girls engaging in sex for menstrual essentials is like a horror movie and a nightmare. We need to have the courage as Ghanaians to do right by our girls, needy daughters, and sisters,"" she emphasized.

 Looking at the present dire situation and into the future, she stated that Ghanaians must seek the low-hanging fruits of how to prevent females from this horrible and horrifying reality of engaging in prostitution to manage their menstrual hygiene.

 ""As a community of Ghanaians, we need to rethink sustainable menstrual hygiene practices for the development of our girls.

 ""Political will for strategic decisions and actions must be deployed swiftly to stop the destructive impact on our girls and the future of our communities. This is not just a women's matter but a grave national issue.

 ""So, we call on the government to immediately place zero taxes on all sanitary products and to initiate the establishment of factories to produce affordable Ghana-made sanitary products from alternative sources like banana fiber, among others,"" she emphasized.",,Health, 30 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Unchain-our-girls-from-sex-for-menstrual-hygiene-essentials-Dr-Otiko-Afisah-Djaba-to-gov-t-1933289
What you need to know about Hepatitis B,"What is hepatitis?:

Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. The liver is a vital organ that processes nutrients, filters the blood, and fights infections. When the liver is
inflamed or damaged, its function can be affected.

Heavy alcohol use, toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions can cause hepatitis. However, hepatitis is most often caused by a virus. In
the United States, the most common types of viral hepatitis are Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.

Hepatitis B can be a serious liver disease that results from infection with the Hepatitis B virus. Acute Hepatitis B refers to a short-term infection that
occurs within the first 6 months after someone is infected with the virus. The infection can range in severity from a mild illness with few or no symptoms
to a serious condition requiring hospitalization. 

Some people, especially adults, are able to clear, or get rid of, the virus without treatment. People who clear the virus become immune and cannot get infected with the hepatitis B virus again.

Chronic hepatitis B refers to a lifelong infection with the hepatitis B virus. The likelihood that a person develops a chronic infection depends on their age.
which someone becomes infected. Up to 90% of infants infected with the Hepatitis B virus will develop a chronic infection. In contrast, about 5% of adults will develop chronic hepatitis B. Over time, chronic hepatitis B can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death.

How is Hepatitis B spread?:

The Hepatitis B virus is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluids from an infected person enter the body of someone who is not infected. The virus can
be spread through:

Sex with an infected person: Among adults, hepatitis B is often spread through sexual contact.

Injection drug use: Sharing needles, syringes, and any other equipment to inject drugs with someone infected with Hepatitis B can spread the virus.

Outbreaks: While uncommon, poor infection control has resulted in outbreaks of hepatitis B in healthcare settings.

Birth: Hepatitis B can be passed from an infected mother to her baby at birth. Worldwide, most people with Hepatitis B are infected with the virus
as an infant.

Hepatitis B is not spread through breastfeeding, sharing eating utensils, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, or sneezing. Unlike some forms of
Hepatitis B is also not spread by contaminated food or water.

What are the symptoms of Hepatitis B:

Many people with Hepatitis B do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If symptoms occur, they can include fever, feeling tired, not wanting to eat, upset stomach, throwing up, dark urine, grey-colored stool, joint pain, and yellow skin and eyes.

When do symptoms occur?

If symptoms occur with an acute infection, they usually appear within 3 months of exposure and can last up to 6 months. If symptoms occur with chronic
Hepatitis B, which can take years to develop, can be a sign of advanced liver disease.

How would you know if you have Hepatitis B?:

The only way to know if you have Hepatitis B is to get tested. Blood tests can determine if a person has been infected, cleared the virus, and is currently
infected, or has never been infected.

Who should get tested for hepatitis B, and why?:

The CDC develops recommendations for testing based on a variety of different factors. Here is a list of people who should get tested. The results will help
determine the next best steps for vaccination or medical care.

All pregnant women are routinely tested for Hepatitis B. If a woman has Hepatitis B, timely vaccination can help prevent the spread of the virus to her baby. 

Household and sexual contacts of people with Hepatitis B are at risk of getting Hepatitis B. Those who have never had Hepatitis B can benefit from vaccination.
People born in certain parts of the world that have increased rates of Hepatitis

Testing helps identify those who are infected so that they can receive timely medical care. People with certain medical conditions should be tested and get vaccinated if needed. This includes people with HIV infection, people who
receive chemotherapy, and people are on hemodialysis.

People who inject drugs are at increased risk for Hepatitis B, but testing can tell if someone is infected or could benefit from vaccination to prevent getting infected with the virus. Men who have sex with men have higher rates of Hepatitis B. Testing can identify unknown infections or let a person know that they can benefit from vaccination.

How is Hepatitis B treated?

For those with acute hepatitis B, doctors usually recommend rest, adequate nutrition, fluids, and close medical monitoring. Some people may need to be hospitalized. People living with chronic hepatitis B should be evaluated for liver problems and monitored on a regular basis. Treatments are available that can slow down or prevent the effects of liver disease.

Can hepatitis B be prevented?

Yes. The best way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as a series of 3 shots over a period of 6 months. The entire series is needed for long-term protection.

Who should get vaccinated against Hepatitis B?:

All infants are routinely vaccinated for Hepatitis B at birth, which has led to dramatic declines in new Hepatitis B cases in the US and many parts of the
world. The vaccine is also recommended for people living with someone infected with Hepatitis B, travelers to certain countries, and healthcare and public safety workers exposed to blood. People with high-risk sexual behaviors, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and people who have certain medical conditions, including diabetes, should talk to their doctor about getting vaccinated.",,Health, 29 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/What-you-need-to-know-about-Hepatitis-B-1933173
Address menstrual poverty among school girls - Josephine Oppong-Yeboah calls on duty bearers,"Media personality and gender advocate, Josephine Oppong-Yeboah, has raised concern about the stigma and practical difficulties many women and girls face in Ghana during their periods.

She said many girls have to abandon classes during their periods because of a lack of sanitary facilities in many schools to enable such girls to properly keep themselves clean during the period.

Some schools lack water and no safe place to change and dispose of their pads, she said, adding that Young girls still in schools mostly lack confidence when they do not have access to pads.

For her, some girls also avoid schools because they do not have access to sanitary pads for their menstruation, she noted. 

Oppong-Yeboah, who was speaking with the media in connection with this years World Menstrual Day, said the pandemic is threatening decades of progress made in building girls knowledge and providing an enabling environment for effective management of menstruation.

She expressed the concern that while the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the poor access to sanitary products and heightened the levels of period poverty, it has also exposed the inadequate toilet or WASH facilities across schools.

World Menstrual Day

Menstrual Hygiene Day is a global platform that brings together government agencies, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and the media, among others, to promote good Menstrual Hygiene Management.

Menstrual Hygiene Day helps to break the silence and build awareness about the fundamental role that good menstrual hygiene plays in enabling women and girls to reach their full potential.

The theme for this years celebration is; We Need to Step up Action and Investment in Menstrual Health and Hygiene Now! #TimeforAction.

Menstruation and Schooling

For Josephine Oppong-Yeboah, it is sad that some girls have to abandon their classes due to their menstruation, calling on school managements to improve WASH facilities and ensure girls stay in school to complete their cycle of education.

Touching on period poverty, she said many girls, particularly those in less privileged homes, often find it difficult to afford menstrual products during menstruation.

That, she noted, girls who are unable to afford menstrual products often resort to unhygienic practices in keeping themselves clean during their period.

Menstruation, Oppong-Yeboah said, is an integral part of a womans life but a nightmare for many women and girls around the world who cannot afford sanitary products.

She has, therefore, urged duty bearers at all levels to understand the need that this is an area that requires urgent intervention, saying menstrual hygiene is a way of telling our young girls and women how to manage their menstruation.

Misconceptions/Menstrual Hygiene Day

She also described misconceptions associated with menstruation as barriers to development, saying In some cultures, when a women or girl is menstruating, she cannot do certain things in their homes, with some girls denied the opportunity to go school.", Kwame Zadok,Health, 29 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Address-menstrual-poverty-among-school-girls-Josephine-Oppong-Yeboah-calls-on-duty-bearers-1933171
Menstrual hygiene book No More Suffering in Silence launched on eCampus app,"Conversations about menstruation, a natural occurrence in women, have for centuries been considered taboo in many cultures and societies in the world.

Millions of girls and women are suffering in silence, girls miss school or even drop out altogether to avoid being teased and ridiculed due to the misinformation, shame and stigma surrounding menstruation. 

Many girls experience their first menses with extreme shock and alarm, without knowing anything at all about menstruation, others are bombarded with some superstitions and misinformation. 

The phenomenon occurs in women every 28 days cycle for 5 days on average. A decade ago, on May 28, 2014, Menstrual Hygiene Day was first observed globally and has since been celebrated every year on the 28th day of the 5th month of the year.

The day is dedicated to breaking taboos and raising awareness about access to menstrual products and the importance of good menstrual hygiene management (MHM). 

According to UNICEF, around 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate every month. The majority of them are young people living in the global south, especially in Africa. 

There is an urgent need to educate the general public on menstruation in general, menstrual hygiene in particular and as a necessity, advocating for a menstruation-friendly society.

Rhoda Kadoa Wedam, a menstrual hygiene advocate and founder of the Song-Ba Empowerment Centre located in Tamale, Northern Region of Ghana authored the book No More Suffering in Silence. An Illustrated Guide on Menstruation to help parents, teachers, girls and women, boys and men understand the significance of menstruation, the importance on menstrual hygiene and the collective responsibility of everyone in providing a supportive environment to our sisters and mothers who for no faults of theirs must experience the natural occurrence of menstruation every 28 days. 

eCampus founder and chief executive, Cecil Senna Nutakor met the author of ""No More Suffering in Silence,"" Rhoda Kadoa Wedam at Lucy Quists Bold New Normal conference as panellists in October of 2023 in Accra, Ghana. 

A collaboration was initiated between eCampus and the author to create an interactive digital version of the book; No More Suffering in Silence in English, French and Arabic for distribution on the eCampus app across its mobile and web platforms.

On Africa Day, May 25, 2024, the paperback and interactive digital copies of the menstrual hygiene book; No More Suffering in Silence were successfully launched in Tamale, Northern Region of Ghana in preparation for the 10th Anniversary of World Menstrual Hygiene Day celebrations which was marked on May 28, 2024, with the theme ""A Period Friendly World.""

Several dignitaries were in attendance at the book launch committed to advancing menstrual hygiene advocacy. 

Madam Beata Akanjani, Chairperson for the Ghana Coalition of NGOs in Water and Sanitation Sector (Coniwas), gave a presentation on the 2024 theme for the celebration of menstrual hygiene day which states Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld. 

She pointed out the fact that in Ghana, girls miss up to 5 school days a month during menstruation due to inadequate WASH facilities, lack of sanitary products and feelings of discomfort, e.g. cramps (Sanitary Pad Interventions for Girls Education in Ghana, 2012). 

This translates to approximately 15 school days per school term and 45 per academic year, enough to cause failure in an exam, further disadvantaging girls and perpetuating gender inequality. 

Rev. Sanatu Nantogma, the Executive Director of Tuma Kavi Development Association, gave the speech that officially launched the book with other dignitaries. 

Furthermore, she quoted a 2011 UNESCO study, saying it was established that every extra year of a womans schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent. 

""This statistic underscores the far-reaching impact of education on societal health and well-being. By providing girls with the necessary resources (including relevant information as contained in Rhodas No More Suffering in Silence) to manage their menstruation and thereby facilitating their stay in school, we are not only improving their lives but also contributing to the broader health and wellbeing of our communities,"" he stressed. 

The Northern Regional Director of Ghana Education Service was represented by Mrs Linda Amoah, the Girl Child Coordinator for the region. 

She mentioned that there has always been misinformation about menstruation and often seen as a taboo in some communities which has had some negative impact on girls. She also mentioned the absence of structures in schools to help girls cope with menstruation. The launch of the book is timely and will help girls deal with the issues of menstruation and while serving as a guide to teachers and parents.

The Chief of Mission for UNICEF, Tamale. Bhanu Pathak extended his solidarity message with a speech. He stated that UNICEF focus on sanitation and hygiene as a global concern. Menstrual hygiene has been approved by the Board of UNICEF as a core program in which they are working to improve the access to menstrual hygiene supplies.

World Menstrual Hygiene Day: Mike Oquaye Jnr. donates 400 boxes of sanitary pads at Taifa Polyclinic,"In a significant step towards promoting women's health and empowerment, Ambassador Michael Oquaye Jnr., the New Patriotic Party (NPP) Parliamentary Candidate for Dome-Kwabenya Constituency, participated in the 2024 World Menstrual Hygiene Day celebration hosted by the Public Health Unit at Taifa Polyclinic on May 28, 2024.

The event, themed ""Together for a Period-Friendly World,"" aimed to raise awareness and drive action towards improving menstrual hygiene globally.

During his address, Oquaye Jr. highlighted the pervasive issue of menstrual stigma and its profound impact on women and girls worldwide. He stated, ""Millions of women and girls are prevented from reaching their full potential simply because they menstruate. On this day, we unite to change that. Together, we can increase awareness and action towards our common goal: a Period-Friendly World.""

He emphasized the importance of breaking the taboos and stigma surrounding menstruation and ensuring universal access to quality menstrual products and medicines.

Oquaye Jr. underscored the critical importance of menstrual hygiene, noting that poor menstrual hygiene can lead to infections and other health issues, thereby impacting the overall well-being of women and girls. 

He stressed that access to menstrual products, safe and private facilities, and accurate information about menstruation are essential for achieving gender equality and upholding human rights.

Highlighting the challenges faced, Oquaye Jnr. mentioned a lack of access to affordable and hygienic menstrual products, inadequate sanitation facilities, particularly in schools and workplaces, and persistent stigma and cultural taboos that hinder open discussions about menstruation.

""The impact on education and employment is profound,"" he explained. ""Girls often miss school during their periods due to a lack of proper facilities or menstrual products, leading to higher dropout rates. Women may face difficulties in the workplace due to inadequate menstrual hygiene management options, affecting their productivity and career growth.""

Michael Oquaye Jr.'s participation and heartfelt commitment to this cause reflect his dedication to the well-being and empowerment of women and girls in the Dome-Kwabenya Constituency and beyond. His proactive stance on such critical issues underscores his vision of a society where all individuals can thrive with dignity and equality.", Felix Nyarko,Health, 28 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/World-Menstrual-Hygiene-Day-Mike-Oquaye-Jnr-donates-400-boxes-of-sanitary-pads-at-Taifa-Polyclinic-1933021
"Menstruation, a normal fact of life not a taboo - NGO","Regrettably, discussions around menstruation are still shrouded in secrecy due to social norms, religious beliefs, and related myths. This phenomenon can be attributed to many factors, including lack or inadequacy of knowledge, myths or beliefs, and misconceptions about menstruation. 

It is for this reason that calls have been intensified for the need to increase awareness and education on menstrual hygiene. 

Girls Shall Grow, a non-governmental organization headquartered in Obuasi, has been at the forefront of campaigns to sensitize young girls on the need to maintain personal hygiene and also correct certain misconceptions about menstruation. 

Speaking at a symposium organized by Girls Shall Grow and the SRC Women's Commission of KNUST-Obuasi campus to mark 2024 World Menstrual Hygiene Day, the Executive Director of Girls Shall Grow, Louisa Amoah, bemoaned the level of stigmatization and misconceptions associated with menstruation. 

She said menstruation is a natural process experienced by all adolescent girls and hence should not be treated as taboo. 

She encouraged the girls to be confident and speak out against all forms of maltreatment encountered during menstruation. 

The symposium brought together about 300 students from the KNUST-Obuasi campus, Junior High and Senior High schools in Obuasi, as well as health personnel, to share their opinions on how to maintain menstrual hygiene.

Menstrual health is a fundamental aspect of human rights, dignity, and public health. Menstrual Hygiene Day, observed annually on May 28, is dedicated to breaking taboos and raising awareness about the importance of good menstrual hygiene management. 

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the program, Louisa Amoah said the theme for this year's celebration, ""Together for a period-friendly world,"" was spot on, stressing that it's about time issues of menstruation being made an open subject for all to discuss. 

""We realize that there is a whole hostile environment making it very difficult for girls to freely talk about menstruation and their experiences, so we are seizing opportunities like this to sensitize the girls to freely speak out while advising the public to make it easier for issues of menstruation to be discussed,"" she said. 

Dr. (Med) Enyonam Kwawukume, the Obuasi East District Health Director who was the resource person, took participants through the four phases of the menstrual cycle. This, she said, includes menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. 

She said common menstrual problems encountered by women during menstruation are heavy or painful periods and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). 

She advised the girls to be careful during the menstrual cycle since the chances of getting pregnant always increase at that stage. 

The Women's Commissioner of KNUST-Obuasi campus, Claudia Owusu Amoh, said the need for girls to maintain good hygiene during menstruation was what necessitated their collaboration with Girls Shall Grow for the program. 

She, however, appealed to the government to intervene by making sanitary pads accessible to girls in school. 

""Now the cost factor in getting sanitary pads has become a challenge for parents. While the government looks at bringing the cost down, I am suggesting that the government can give out free sanitary pads to schoolgirls just as we do for books and uniforms,"" she said. 

A student of Boete L/A JHS 'B', Etilda Banoba, recounted the ordeal her mother goes through periodically to get sanitary pads for her. 

She said the cost of sanitary pads has made it difficult for her to maintain proper hygiene during that period of the month. 

""It hasnt been easy since I started menstruating. The price of the pads is very high, so getting sanitary pads and food at the same time is something difficult for my mother to do. This is really a challenge for most of us,"" she said.

She appealed to the government and other benevolent institutions to volunteer sanitary pads for girls, especially those in schools. This, she said, can prevent frequent absenteeism in schools.", Sampson Manu,Health, 28 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Menstruation-a-normal-fact-of-life-not-a-taboo-NGO-1933019
"Eating fufu, omo tuo, tuo zaafi together from one bowl spreads Hepatitis B - Professor Akosa","Renowned cellular pathologist and lifestyle wellness consultant, Professor Agyeman Badu Akosa, has raised concerns about the communal eating of soupy foods like fufu, omo tuo, and tuo zaafi, warning that it can facilitate the spread of Hepatitis B.

 During a discussion aimed at improving health quality in Ghana at the Ghana Shippers Authority Hall in Accra, Professor Akosa explained how the practice of eating from a single bowl can lead to the transmission of Hepatitis B.

 He pointed out that when people put their hands in their mouths and then dip them into the communal soup, they can inadvertently mix saliva with the soup.

 This behaviour increases the risk of spreading Hepatitis B if one of the individuals is infected.

 ""Once upon a time, we were all there, there was group participation, group eating, group everything, and even the eating, it was later on that I realized that this is how we spread Hepatitis B. We didn't know that. We are all eating fufu, by the time you finish, you are drinking saliva.

 ""I mean, five, six of you, you are doing omo tuo or you are doing fufu, what do you think you are doing? You are going in like that and then you come in, by the time you are ending, you are drinking saliva. It is the easiest way to spread Hepatitis B,"" Graphic.com.gh quoted.

 The discussion was part of the latest edition of the Graphic National Dialogue Series, organized by the Graphic Communications Group Ltd.

 Professor Akosa and health policy and management expert, Prof. Aaron Abuosi, were the main speakers on the theme ""Quality Health for All.""

 This series serves as a forum for discussing development issues with a focus on achieving national consensus in a non-partisan environment.

 It also aims to collate ideas into a document to influence policymaking at various levels of society.

Its criminal to ignore threat of jaundice to newborns - Paediatricians told,"Dr. Bright Danyoh, Head of the Pediatric and Child Health sub-BMC of the Ho Teaching Hospital, has cautioned pediatric nurses and midwives not to downplay the severity of jaundice in newborns.

He said it must be considered an act of crime to ignore the risks of neonatal jaundice, a disease that threatens almost all newborns with brain damage, loss of eyesight, and death.

Dr. Danyoh gave caution at the launch of the 2024 Newborn Jaundice Awareness Month.

The celebration was themed ""The Newborn Jaundice and Exclusive Breastfeeding: Nurses and Midwives Lead.""

Present at the launch were members of the Pediatric and Child Health Sub-BMC.

The admonition was against the realization of the role of health workers in the rising incidents of the disease, and stakeholders at the event spoke of how some pediatricians and midwives were found to dismiss the suspicions of mothers, although jaundice remained the leading cause of newborn admission.

Dr. Danyoh said despite successes with awareness campaigns, the attitude of health workers caused severe newborn jaundice to remain a challenge.

He said there was a fear of health workers giving out wrong information and false hopes, and he insisted that they had no right to ignore the signs of the disease.

""It is criminal not to know the bilirubin levels of newborns and tell the mothers to go home,"" Dr. Danyoh said, adding that nurses' knowledge of early detection would be strengthened through training.

""These things are really going on,"" Mary Kutsi, Nurse Manager of the Pediatric Unit, lamented, sharing details of how mothers lost their babies after health workers waved off their suspicions.

She said midwives and pediatricians were found to often shrug suspicious mothers off and ask them to apply conventional sunlight therapy, and that this was the cause of late referrals.

""Mothers take this advice, and before they realize it, its too late. We need to advocate more because it is causing a lot of damage to the community,"" the nurse manager said.

Dr. Edem Sarbah, a lead pediatrician in the region, also said, ""Mothers are picking up public awareness, but they come to meet health workers who turn them back. Let's make sure we get the right information and do what must be done.""

Gift Dravie, in charge of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), noted that 2022 remains the highest with admissions for neonatal jaundice with a total of 415 cases and that the success also was that death rates remained ""very low.""

She also attested to increased awareness among mothers and caregivers, saying, ""More mothers are reporting on their own to the clinic, and it shows our advocacy is working.""

Ms. Dravie used the moment to draw stakeholder attention to the need for equipment, saying the unit worked with limited phototherapy machines and test equipment.

Perfect Titianti, Ho Municipal Director of Health Services, complimented the Sub BMC for ""the passion and commitment to the issues"" and said the Health Directorate would collaborate to ensure babies with challenges were promptly referred.

Evelyn Sunnu, Acting Head of the Department of Midwifery at the UHAS School of Nursing and Midwifery, delivered the keynote address and said education on neonatal jaundice should begin during pregnancy and that health workers must reconsider visiting mothers in their homes after delivery to monitor the babies.",,Health, 28 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/It-s-criminal-to-ignore-threat-of-jaundice-to-newborns-Paediatricians-told-1932985
"2024 Menstrual Hygiene Day: 10 menstrual tips that girls, women should follow for better health","GhanaWeb Feature by: Bernice Owusuwaa 

 Menstrual Hygiene Day, observed annually on May 28, is a global initiative aimed at breaking the silence and raising awareness about the importance of good menstrual hygiene management.

 The date, May 28, symbolizes the average 28-day menstrual cycle and the average duration of menstruation, which is five days, reinforcing the importance of the cause it champions.

 This years Menstrual Hygiene Day is very significant for Ghanaians due to the results of the Dont tax my pad campaign.

 The tireless efforts of advocates and civil society organizations were recognized in the governments 2024 Nkunimde budget statement.

 Then finance minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, announced that locally produced sanitary pads will be tax-free, effectively lowering the prices of locally produced pads. This was welcome news for pad advocates, all girls, and women.

 As we celebrate the 2024 Menstrual Hygiene Day today, under the theme Together for a #PeriodFriendlyWorld, this article will highlight some pointers that can help girls and women during that time of the month.

 To begin with, it is important to note that menstrual health is a human rights issue, not just a health one.

Know the facts about menstruation

 UNICEF defines menstruation or menses as the natural bodily process of releasing blood and associated matter from the uterus through the vagina as part of the menstrual cycle.

 Inspirahealthnetwork.org underscores that good menstrual health involves knowing the signs of possible issues. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of common menstrual health issues, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menstrual cramps, irregular periods, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Understanding these issues can help you identify abnormalities and know when to talk to your doctor.

Here are some essential tips to improve your menstrual health and hygiene:

1. Change sanitary products regularly

 Changing sanitary products regularly prevents bacterial growth and infections. Change pads every 4-6 hours, tampons every 4-8 hours, and menstrual cups according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

2. Use the right sanitary product

 Using the right sanitary product ensures comfort and effectiveness in managing menstrual flow. Choose from pads, tampons, menstrual cups, or period panties based on your flow and personal preference.

3. Maintain personal hygiene

 Personal hygiene reduces the risk of infections and odours. Wash your genital area at least twice a day with plain warm water. Avoid using scented products that can irritate the skin.

4. Dispose of used products properly

 This prevents the spread of infections and maintains cleanliness. Wrap used sanitary products in paper and dispose of them in a designated bin. Never flush them down the toilet.

5. Wear comfortable, breathable undergarments

 Wearing comfortable, breathable undergarments reduces moisture build-up and the risk of yeast infections. Choose cotton underwear over synthetic fabrics and change them daily.

6. Practice good hand hygiene

 Practising good hand hygiene prevents the transfer of germs and bacteria. Wash your hands with soap before and after changing sanitary products.

7. Stay hydrated

 Staying hydrated helps manage bloating and promotes overall health. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.

8. Maintain a balanced diet

 A balanced diet supports overall menstrual health and reduces symptoms like cramps and fatigue. Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, and avoid excessive caffeine and salty foods.

9. Exercise regularly

 Regular exercise can alleviate menstrual cramps and improve mood. Engage in moderate exercise like walking, yoga, or swimming for at least 30 minutes a day.

10. Track your menstrual cycle

 Tracking your menstrual cycle helps predict your period, manage symptoms, and identify any irregularities. Use a calendar or a period-tracking app to record the start and end dates of your periods, as well as any symptoms you experience.

Conclusion

 Maintaining good menstrual hygiene is essential for preventing infections and promoting overall health and wellness.

"Let's return to our traditional ways of eating kontomire, cocoyam leaves - Professor Akosa","Renowned cellular pathologist and lifestyle wellness consultant, Professor Agyeman Badu Akosa, has emphasized the importance of consuming local Ghanaian foods to combat communicable diseases, which currently pose significant health challenges in the country.

 Speaking at a discussion on practical ideas to improve quality health in Ghana held at the Ghana Shippers Authority Hall in Accra, Professor Akosa highlighted the detrimental effects of consuming sugar-sweetened beverages, fried foods, and processed foods, which are strongly associated with non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, heart diseases, and diabetes.

 The event featured Professor Akosa alongside health policy and management expert, Prof. Aaron Abuosi, under the theme ""Quality Health for All.""

 According to a Graphic report, Professor Akosa stressed the significance of health promotion and urged Ghanaians to prioritize locally produced foods over Western and fast foods to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.

 He lamented the trend of Ghanaians turning away from nutritious local foods in favour of imported, highly processed alternatives with high sugar content.

 ""I urge us all to go back to our former ways of eating kontomire or cocoyam leaves, garden eggs, okro, abedru, and all that keep us healthy and also minimize the dependence on pizzas, noodles, and fried foods,"" Professor Akosa advised.

 He stressed the importance of traditional Ghanaian diets rich in natural ingredients and nutrients for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases.
