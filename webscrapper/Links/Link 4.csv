Euro 2024: Spain beat Georgia to set up quarterfinal tie with Germany,"Spain set up a blockbuster quarter-final tie with Euro 2024 hosts Germany by surviving an early scare to ease past Georgia.


Playing in their first major tournament, Georgia had to soak up heavy pressure from Spain early on but stunned those watching on at Cologne Stadium when they took a surprise lead after 18 minutes.


Spain defender Robin le Normand poked Otar Kakabadze's curling cross into his own net, finishing off a devastating counter-attack and silencing supporters behind their goal.


Substitutes warming up sprinted over to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who led Georgia's celebrations in the corner.


It sparked confidence in Georgia but Spain's pressure eventually paid off when Manchester City's Rodri drilled a shot into the bottom corner - beating goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who had another outstanding overall display.




Spain continued to excite in attack, stringing together countless chances, and capitalised when Fabian Ruiz nodded in a cross from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.


Georgia continued to battle and Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia would have scored the goal of the tournament had his clever chip from the halfway line bounced a metre to the right instead of passing the post.


But despite Georgia's flair and unpredictability, Spain's accomplished possession game took control - Nico Williams striking powerfully into the roof of the net to make it 3-1, before Dani Olmo's precise finish capped things off.


European giants and home favourites Germany are up next for Spain in Stuttgart on Friday, while Georgia exit the competition after a fairytale run in which they massively exceeded expectations.

Euro 2024: England come from behind to beat Slovakia to advance to quarterfinals,"Jude Bellingham produced a moment of genius to keep England in Euro 2024 as they survived another desperate display and a huge scare to beat Slovakia in dramatic fashion to reach the last eight.


England were seconds away from an embarrassing exit in Gelsenkirchen as Slovakia defended a lead they had held since the 25th minute when Ivan Schranz raced into the box to poke a low finish past England keeper Jordan Pickford.


It was then that Bellingham, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Saturday, demonstrated the brilliance that has made him England’s new superstar by going airborne in the penalty area to send Marc Guehi’s headed flick past Martin Dubravka with a stunning overhead kick.


Bellingham rescued England from a performance that scaled such depths that his goal was their first effort on target – but then set the platform for a victory as Slovakia, who had defended so stubbornly, were left stunned.


And captain Harry Kane emphasised England’s sudden superiority a minute into the extra 30 minutes when he headed home from close range to complete a remarkable turnaround and set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland.




England’s display before Bellingham’s wonder goal was another to add to the catalogue of mediocrity they have delivered under Gareth Southgate in Germany, even though Kane had missed an easy header and Declan Rice struck a post as they strived for the equaliser.


Bellingham, the young man with the Midas touch, came up with the goods to save them at the death as England's stuttering Euro 2024 journey goes on.

Euro 2024: Havertz and Musiala score to take Germany to last 8,"Kai Havertz and Jamal Musiala scored as Euro 2024 hosts Germany reached the quarter-finals by beating Denmark in a game that was interrupted by a spectacular storm.


The last-16 tussle at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion was suspended for around 20 minutes towards the end of the first half, as lightning lit up the sky and the pitch was soaked by hail and heavy rain.


But the game was also notable for calls by the video assistant referee, with Nico Schlotterbeck having had an early header ruled out by VAR, while Denmark were denied in the second half when Joachim Andersen's strike was chalked off as team-mate Thomas Delaney was flagged just offside.


Germany were celebrating another VAR call in their favour moments after the Danes' disallowed goal when referee Michael Oliver was called to the pitchside monitor and awarded a penalty for handball by Andersen.


Havertz put a cool spot-kick out of Kasper Schmeichel's reach to delight the passionate home fans.




The forward should have scored a second soon after when he clipped a shot over Schmeichel only to see it go wide, but Germany had their decisive second with just over 20 minutes remaining.


This time it was young star Musiala who got the goal as he raced through on the left and slotted into the far corner.


From then on the home fans were on their feet, roaring their side on for more goals, hoping they would really lay down a marker to suggest they might go all the way.


No more were forthcoming, but the Germany fans cheered their side passionately at the final whistle in celebration of this convincing win.




They will next play the winner of Sunday's game between Spain, who have looked one of the best sides so far at Euro 2024, and surprise package Georgia. That quarter-final is scheduled for Friday, 5 July.

Euro 2024: Switzerland stun defending champions Italy to reach last 8,"Holders Italy made a limp exit from Euro 2024 as a sparkling display from Switzerland helped them set up a potential quarter-final meeting with England.


The Swiss dominated from the start and took a deserved lead when the impressive Ruben Vargas crossed for Remo Freuler, who took a touch before hammering a low shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma.


Vargas, who plays his club football in Germany for Augsburg, made it 2-0 just 27 seconds into the second half when he picked up Michel Aebischer’s pass near the left-hand corner of the Italy area and expertly bent the ball into the far top corner of the net.


Italy did not manage a shot on target until the 73rd minute and their best effort before then came when Switzerland defender Fabian Schar headed Nicolo Fagioli’s cross against his own post, with Yann Sommer stranded.


Although Gianluca Scamacca also hit the woodwork from close range before the end, the Azzurri never seriously threatened a fightback and their forgettable campaign in Germany simply fizzled out.




While they head home, Switzerland, roared on in Berlin by their boisterous and frequently bouncing supporters, head for Dusseldorf where they will play the winners of England’s tie with Slovakia on Saturday, 6 July (16:00 GMT).

Belgium FA issues official apology to Mbappe after Amadou Onana pledges to kick France star,"Belgium have apologised after they posted a video of Amadou Onana chanting that he will target Kylian Mbappe's shin during their Euro 2024 clash.


WHAT HAPPENED?


The video showed the Everton midfielder alongside the Belgian-based comedian Pablo Andres singing about Mbappe. The comedian chanted: ""Who will tackle Mbappe in the shin?"" before Onana chanted in return, ""Onana, Amadou Onana!"" Following backlash, the Belgian FA deleted the video from all their social media accounts and issued an apology.





WHAT BELGIUM SAID


Before the pre-match press conference, Belgium's press officer Stefan Van Loock said: ""It was not the intention to attack anyone. We have been working with comedian Pablo Andres for a long time, this video also had to be funny.


""But we misjudged that and also took the video offline. We would like to apologise to anyone we may have offended with this. For us, this is the end of the matter.""





THE BIGGER PICTURE


The neighbouring nations and rivals face off in the European Championship round of 16 on Monday as Belgium look to get revenge for their 1-0 defeat in the 2018 World Cup semi-final. Although much of the 'golden generation' of Belgians have retired, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku have continued to display their strong connection - even if the latter has scored three disallowed goals. In contrast, France have yet to live up to their pre-tournament expectations.







WHAT NEXT FOR BELGIUM?


Onana will have the chance to make his mark on Mbappe and France on Monday as the Rode Duivels look to progress to the quarter-finals. The winner of the game will face the winner of Portugal and Slovenia in that game next weekend.

Copa America: Weah suffers racist abuse after red card in US loss,"The United States Soccer Federation condemned the online racist abuse suffered by several of its players following a 2-1 defeat by Panama at the Copa America.


Monaco striker Folarin Balogun, Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards and Juventus pair Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie were all targeted online after the hosts lost the Group C match in Atlanta.


Weah, 24, was shown a straight red card in the 18th minute after punching Panama's Roderick Miller in the head in an off-the-ball incident.


The former Lille winger, who apologised to his team-mates for the incident, said it was a ""moment of frustration"".


US Soccer said in a statement on X: ""There is absolutely no place in the game for such hateful and discriminatory behaviour.




""These actions are not only unacceptable but also contrary to the values of respect and inclusivity that we uphold as an organisation.""


Despite Panama's numerical advantage, it was the US that took the lead at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium through a superb strike from Balogun - his fifth goal in 14 appearances for the US.





The lead lasted just four minutes as Cesar Blackman equalised from the edge of the box for Panama, who are 43rd in the Fifa world rankings.


The US, ranked 11th, defended admirably but Panama's pressure told seven minutes from time as Jose Fajardo netted from close range.




Shortly before full-time, Panama were also reduced to 10 men when Adalberto Carrasquilla was shown a red card for a reckless swipe on winger Christian Pulisic.


The US, who co-host the men's World Cup in 2026 with Canada and Mexico, are now level on points with Panama heading into their final group match against Uruguay on 2 July at 02:00 BST.


The US, who have a better goal difference, need to match Panama's result against Bolivia to progress to the last 16.

Referees Manager Alex Kotey calls for expanded live tv coverage to improve officiating,"The top-flight competition has faced widespread criticism for controversial decisions in the just-ended season. 


The awarding of goals and decisions by referees, especially on the final day of the season, sparked suggestions of match-fixing. 


Kotey acknowledged existing limitations in broadcasting capacity but advocated for expansion.


""[I wish] all our matches can be televised live because when there is a live match, the attention and focus is on you [referee],"" he told Asempa FM. 


""You will also not want [to commit blunders], but here again, it is up to the sponsors. They think that they cannot show all the matches. 




They can show about four matches. I think going forward, if we can expand a little bit to get more coverage, it will help.""


StarTimes, who are the exclusive rights holder for the league after signing a $5.25 million agreement in 2020, are rumored to have terminated the deal. 


As a result, the Ghana Football Association is currently seeking a new partner.

IKF Ghana and Togos MUAY Thai Association seal historic partnership,"The International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) Ghana has entered a groundbreaking partnership with the Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo.


The collaboration was officially announced at a ceremony in Togo on Wednesday, June 26 where IKF President, Ahmed Ibrahim and Henry Jallah, Technical Director of Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo, formalised the alliance, which is set to last for five years.


According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo will provide hospitality, free competition venues, training workshops, and championship opportunities for Ghanaian kickboxing and combat sports athletes.


The agreement also includes commitments to extend both cash and in-kind support to each other.


President Ahmed Ibrahim highlighted the importance of this partnership, describing it as a crucial step toward the IKF’s mission to revitalise the sport. 




“This partnership signifies another significant step in our forward march towards securing the necessary logistics to advance our goal of making the sport better for all,” he said.


The two African nations have received invitations to tournaments in Brazil and the USA later this year. 


IKF Ghana will participate with two fighters, Abdul Hadi Sani and Salom Darku, while Togo will send three fighters: Zikpli Nassdoechic Adams, Cynthia Jabidar, and Begzy Karttikeya.

Ken Bediako: Ghana and the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games,"This was the first “full scale,” Olympics since the past three boycott prone Olympiads of Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980 and Angeles 1984. A record 159 countries were in the South Korean capital for the biggest sports festival on the planet.


Ghana entered three disciplines, boxing, athletics and table tennis. Even though a couple of the boxers and athletes showed much improvement their performances were not good enough to win any medals.


The four-man boxing squad of flyweight Alfred Kotey, lightweight Ike Quartey, Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah (captain) and Lightmiddleweight


Emmanuel Quaye. All the boxers had an early boost when all of them luckily drew a bye in the first round.


Alfred Ankamah inspired his colleagues with one of the fastest knockouts in the tournament when he stopped Jay Smbeye of Malawi in 1 min 15 secs in the first round. A terrific right caught the Malawian flush on the jaw and he dropped heavily on his back to be counted out.




Flyweight Alfred Kotey followed suit with another first round win for Ghana over Husain Almuntari of Kuwait. The referee stepped in at 2mins 43secs to save the clearly outclassed Kuwaiti from undue punishment.


Lightweight Ike Quartey also won with unanimous decision over Saizozena of Dominican Republic. Ike did well but his stamina appeared suspect in the closing stages of the fight.
















Lightmiddleweight Emmanuel Quaye, lost to Lauren’s Mercando of Equador. Quaye was just too inexperienced and not even the fact that his opponent was given a public warning in the second round for persistently hitting with open gloves, could make any difference. Quaye was given a standing count as round three began and it was obvious that he couldn’t last. It was not surprising therefore when he was decked just before the end of the round to be counted out.


In his second fight, Flyweight Alfred Kotey produced a blistering double fisted attack to score a unanimous points victory against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath. He dominated the Tanzanian in the first two rounds but the Tanzanian came out strongly in the third round. In hot exchanges late in the round, the Tanzanian opened a cut on the left cheek of Kotey but Kotey had done enough to get the verdict.




Lightweight Ike Quartey lost his second fight to Australia’s Grabane Chevey in a close contest. The first round was even and Ike won the second round. The third was also quite close but when the scores were called, the Australian had been made winner by all the five officials. Most Journalists were of the opinion that, perhaps the aggressive brawling tactics of the Australian might have bamboozled the judges. Ike Quartey obviously felt cheated and he dramatically staged a mini protest by refusing to leave the ring for a couple of minutes. He eventually left after bowing out amidst applause from the crowd.


Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah also lost his second fight against American Kenneth Gould. The American, stronger and much more muscular, was the better boxer Right from round one, he established his superiority proving too elusive for Ankamah to catch with any of his usual bombs. Ankamah was however courageous and determined to fight but he never really found an antidote to Gould’s tactics. The unanimous verdict was never in dispute.


The biggest setback to the boxing team was when medal hopeful Alfred Kotey was declared unfit at the ringside moments before his quarter final bout against Mexican Gonzales. The medical commission of AIBA (International Amateur Boxing Association) ruled that a cut which Kotey had sustained in the previous fight against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath and which had been stitched, was unsafe for the Ghanaian to fight. All attempts by the Ghanaian officials to have the ruling reversed failed. Team physician Dr Forjour was particularly a sad person for sanctioning the stitching of Kotey’s cut.


In athletics, sprinter Leo Myles Mills emerged the most outstanding Ghanaian athlete. He won both the first and second round heats in the 100 metres in 10.33 secs and 10.12 secs to reach the semi-finals.




Team officials believed that the draw of lanes in the semis which put Myles Mills next to the indomitable Carl Lewis of the US, would inspire him. Instead he appeared overawed and tensed up and was surprisingly left behind on the starting blocks as the gun went. In the event Myles Mills finished last in the semis with a time of 10.43 secs having clocked 10 33 secs and 10.21 secs earlier in the heats.


Again in the 200 metres Myles Mills qualified for the second round heats by placing 4th behind Italy’s Stefano Tolli, Carl Lewis and Nigeria’s Olapide Adenikan in 21.04 secs. Then in the quarter finals he finished 6th but didn’t qualify for the semi-finals because his time of 20.95 secs was a shade slower than Belgium’s Patrick Stephens. 


The men’s 100×4 relay quartet of Eric Akogyeram, Nelson Boateng, Salam Gariba and Myles Mills qualified for the semis finishing third behind the Soviet Union and West Germany in 39.13 secs, the 6th fastest of the 14 qualifiers.


The Ghanaians were hopeful of a medal following the disqualification of the strong US team for changing the last baton in the wrong zone whilst winning their first round heats. Poor baton changing however cost Ghana and the team placed fifth in the semis in 39. 46 secs earning an overall 12th position in the rankings. All the first eight clocked under 39 secs.




Triple jumper Francis Dodoo failed to make it to the second round. He managed a poor 16.88 metres after four attempts and thus failed to qualify for the second round.


In the women’s division top star Diana Yankey didn’t have much of a chance in the sprints. Running against the likes of super star Florence Griffiths Joyner the Olympic and world record holder and Evelyn Ashford both of the US. However, she managed to qualify for the second heats where she was eliminated by placing last in 11.64 secs. Also in the women’s 100m metres hurdles Diana Yankey failed to qualify for the second round when she placed 4th in her heats. Her time of 13. 64 secs put her in the 24th ranking out of 33 starters and was not good enough for her to advance.


In the women’s long jump, 16-year-old US-based student Juliana Yendork finished 27th among 29 competitors.


She fell at the end of the first round but one expected Yendork gaining inspiration having compelled against top class athletes like Olympic record holder Jackie Joyner Kersey.




The women’s sprints relay quartet of Veronica Bawuah, Diana Yankey, Mercy Addy and Marha Appiah crashed out in the semis after running the 13th fastest time of 44.12 secs in the quarter finals.


In table tennis young Patricia Akosua Ofei lost all her four matches to place 6th and last in her group Patricia lost 3-1 to Australian Kerry Tapier 21-19, 21-12, 20-22, 21-16. Lost 3-1 to Wai Cheng Lau of Malaysia,18-21, 21-18, 21-17, 21-17 beaten 3-1 by Ka Sha Kok of Hong Kong 21-18, 18-21, 21-17, 21-17 and then 3-0 to Kiyomib Ishida of Japan 20-22,16-21,15-21.


For young Akos, the experience gained by facing top class opposition from China, Malaysia and Japan proved invaluable. She rose to become a national star.

Ive not quit boxing  Ayittey Powers,"Veteran boxer, Michael 'Ayittey Powers' Okine, despite his recent foray into boxing promotion and management, has announced he has not retired from the ring and is ready to compete in the light heavyweight division.


The 43-year-old boxer, known for his distinctive yellow-haired dreadlocks and a professional record of 48 fights (22 wins, 25 losses and 1 draw), expressed his readiness to face any challenger. 


Speaking at the launch of his promotion outfit, Ayittey Powers Promotion, in Accra last Friday, he emphasised his ongoing commitment to the sport and his readiness to enter the ring should anyone dare to face him.


“I have not hung my gloves, I am now into promotion but I am ready to fight anyone,” the 43-year-old famed pugilist told Graphic Sports on the sidelines of the launch of his boxing promotion outfit in Accra last Friday.


Ayittey Powers, who is celebrated for his trilogy with Braimah Kamoko, also known as Bukom Banku, hinted at a potential surprise appearance in the ring during his promotion's first event on June 29 at the Bukom Boxing Arena. 




""Anything is possible there will be surprises on the night and I may be on the bill on the night,’ he said.





The event, dubbed ""Power of the Fist,"" promises to be a thrilling night of boxing, featuring several exciting matchups and Ayittey Powers promised to ensure his maiden promotion left a lasting legacy on the minds of patrons.


“Ayittey Powers Promotion together with my partner Daniel Kofi Ewusie will ensure the best fighters box, challenge one another and give the audience their money's worth,’ he stated.


The headline bout of the night will be a national super middleweight title fight between Ernest Akushey, alias Bahubali and Elvis Ahorgah, alias Soldier. 




Their longstanding rivalry, well-known at Bukom and its environs, is expected to culminate in an intense battle.


Another highlight will be the return of Wasiru ‘Dzatabi’ Mohammed, who will face Isaac Dowuona in a 12-round super-featherweight contest. 


Additionally, a 12-round World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan-African title fight will see Ghana’s Eric Korley take on Adam Hav-Deen Salanon from Benin.

Paris 2024: Ghana fails in attempt to secure boxing qualification,"There will be no Ghanaian boxer at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games as the Black Bombers missed out on securing a spot during the recent World Olympic Qualifiers in Bangkok, Thailand.


Despite the participation of seven boxers, including one female athlete, none managed to turn their Olympic aspirations into reality.


The second world qualifying tournament on the Road to Paris 2024, held at the Indoor Arena – Huamark Stadium Bangkok in Thailand, witnessed Ghana's sole hope in the Women’s Middleweight -75Kg category, Ornella Sathoud, losing by unanimous decision (0-5) to Shierleidis Orozco of Columbia in the round of 16 on Saturday.


Her defeat came hours after Theophilus Allotey had also been eliminated from the qualifying series.


At the last Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, Ghana secured a medal solely through boxing, thanks to Samuel Takyi, who earned a bronze medal.

Tysons fight v Paul postponed on medical advice,"The fight between YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul and former world champion Mike Tyson on 20 July in Texas has been postponed.


The bout at Arlington's AT&T Stadium, home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, had been officially sanctioned as a professional fight but Tyson, 57, says he has been unable to train after a recent ulcer flare up.


""Unfortunately, due to my ulcer flareup, I have been advised by my doctor to lighten my training for a few weeks to rest and recover,"" said Tyson.


""My body is in better overall shape than it has been since the 1990s and I will be back to my full training schedule soon.""


Organisers have not mentioned light-welterweight champion Katie Taylor's rematch with Amanda Serrano, which was due to take place on the same night, but it is anticipated it will also be moved with the rest of the card.




Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), who are staging the event at the 80,000 capacity stadium alongside Netflix, said a new date for the fight will be announced on 7 June.


Mike Tyson and Jake Paul were scheduled to face each other in a professional bout on 20 July in Texas


""The recommendation is for Mike Tyson to do minimal to light training over the next few weeks and then return to full training with no limitations,"" MVP said.


""Both Mike and Jake are in agreement that it is only fair to ensure that both athletes have equal training time to prepare for this important match and can compete at the highest level.


""The health and wellbeing of athletes is our top priority, and we fully support Mike in taking the necessary time to allow him to perform at the level he expects of himself.""




Tyson, who would have turned 58 at the time of the fight and whose professional career ended in 2005, most recently competed in an exhibition bout in 2020.


He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles in 1987 but his reign as unified champion came to a shock end in 1990 as he was beaten by Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.


Paul, 27, is 30 years younger than Tyson and has won nine of his 10 fights, mostly against former UFC fighters, with his solitary defeat coming against British boxer Tommy Fury in February 2023.


He added: ""I fully support postponing the event so Mike Tyson has no excuses come fight night.""




Paul said he did not want to face Tyson ""at anything but his best"".

Paris 2024: Elaine Thompson-Herah out of Olympic Games with injury,"Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time Olympic champion in the 100m and 200m, will miss the Paris Olympics with an Achilles injury.


The 31-year-old Jamaican, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, sustained the injury at the New York City Grand Prix on 9 June and had to be carried off the track.


Thompson-Herah - the only sprinter other than compatriot Usain Bolt to win multiple Olympic titles in both the 100m and 200m - was aiming to defend her 100m crown after choosing not to race in the Jamaica 200m trials.


She said a ""small tear on my Achilles tendon"" ended her chances of competing at a third Olympics.


""It’s a long road but I am willing to start over and keep working and to make full recovery and resume my track career,"" Thompson-Herah wrote on Instagram.




""I am hurt and devastated to be missing the Olympics this year but at the end of the day it’s sports and my health comes first.""


Jamaicans have won the past four Olympic gold medals in the women's 100m.


Thompson-Herah won gold in the 100m and 200m in Rio in 2016 and defended her titles in Tokyo five years later.


She won a fifth Olympic gold in Japan as part of Jamaica's 4x100m relay team.

Ghanas 200m athletes narrowly miss podium at African Seniors Athletics Championships,"Ghana's sprinters Abdul Rasheed Saminu and Mary Boakye narrowly missed out on podium finishes in the men's and women's 200m events at the African Seniors Athletics Championships on Wednesday.


Saminu, competing in the men's 200m, was initially placed third by the electronic timer with a time of 20.66 seconds. However, moments later, his position was reassigned to fourth place, as Cameroon's Emmanuel Eseme was awarded the bronze.


The discrepancy arose from a handwritten timer readjusting Saminu’s time to 20.67 seconds. 


This controversial decision ultimately denied the 23-year-old a bronze medal. The race was won by Liberia's Joseph Fambulleh, who finished in 20.25 seconds, with Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu taking silver in 20.51 seconds.


In the women's 200m final, Mary Boakye also finished fourth, clocking 23.40 seconds.




The event was won by Ivory Coast's Maca Gbai in 22.84 seconds. Gbai’s compatriot Maboundou Kone claimed silver with a time of 22.99 seconds, and Malawi's Asimenye Simwaka took bronze at 23.05 seconds.


In the field events, Ghana's Cadman Evans Yamoah, the reigning African Games men's high jump champion, struggled to replicate his past success.


Yamoah, a student at the University of Central Missouri, was unable to clear the bar at 2.10 meters, exiting in the first phase alongside his compatriot Kennedy Ocansey.


Morocco's Saad Hammouda, whom Yamoah had previously bested at the African Games, secured the gold medal with a jump of 2.15 meters.




Despite the setbacks, Ghana ended the competition with three medals, two gold and one bronze.

Ken Bediako: Ghana and the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games,"This was the first “full scale,” Olympics since the past three boycott prone Olympiads of Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980 and Angeles 1984. A record 159 countries were in the South Korean capital for the biggest sports festival on the planet.


Ghana entered three disciplines, boxing, athletics and table tennis. Even though a couple of the boxers and athletes showed much improvement their performances were not good enough to win any medals.


The four-man boxing squad of flyweight Alfred Kotey, lightweight Ike Quartey, Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah (captain) and Lightmiddleweight


Emmanuel Quaye. All the boxers had an early boost when all of them luckily drew a bye in the first round.


Alfred Ankamah inspired his colleagues with one of the fastest knockouts in the tournament when he stopped Jay Smbeye of Malawi in 1 min 15 secs in the first round. A terrific right caught the Malawian flush on the jaw and he dropped heavily on his back to be counted out.




Flyweight Alfred Kotey followed suit with another first round win for Ghana over Husain Almuntari of Kuwait. The referee stepped in at 2mins 43secs to save the clearly outclassed Kuwaiti from undue punishment.


Lightweight Ike Quartey also won with unanimous decision over Saizozena of Dominican Republic. Ike did well but his stamina appeared suspect in the closing stages of the fight.
















Lightmiddleweight Emmanuel Quaye, lost to Lauren’s Mercando of Equador. Quaye was just too inexperienced and not even the fact that his opponent was given a public warning in the second round for persistently hitting with open gloves, could make any difference. Quaye was given a standing count as round three began and it was obvious that he couldn’t last. It was not surprising therefore when he was decked just before the end of the round to be counted out.


In his second fight, Flyweight Alfred Kotey produced a blistering double fisted attack to score a unanimous points victory against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath. He dominated the Tanzanian in the first two rounds but the Tanzanian came out strongly in the third round. In hot exchanges late in the round, the Tanzanian opened a cut on the left cheek of Kotey but Kotey had done enough to get the verdict.




Lightweight Ike Quartey lost his second fight to Australia’s Grabane Chevey in a close contest. The first round was even and Ike won the second round. The third was also quite close but when the scores were called, the Australian had been made winner by all the five officials. Most Journalists were of the opinion that, perhaps the aggressive brawling tactics of the Australian might have bamboozled the judges. Ike Quartey obviously felt cheated and he dramatically staged a mini protest by refusing to leave the ring for a couple of minutes. He eventually left after bowing out amidst applause from the crowd.


Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah also lost his second fight against American Kenneth Gould. The American, stronger and much more muscular, was the better boxer Right from round one, he established his superiority proving too elusive for Ankamah to catch with any of his usual bombs. Ankamah was however courageous and determined to fight but he never really found an antidote to Gould’s tactics. The unanimous verdict was never in dispute.


The biggest setback to the boxing team was when medal hopeful Alfred Kotey was declared unfit at the ringside moments before his quarter final bout against Mexican Gonzales. The medical commission of AIBA (International Amateur Boxing Association) ruled that a cut which Kotey had sustained in the previous fight against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath and which had been stitched, was unsafe for the Ghanaian to fight. All attempts by the Ghanaian officials to have the ruling reversed failed. Team physician Dr Forjour was particularly a sad person for sanctioning the stitching of Kotey’s cut.


In athletics, sprinter Leo Myles Mills emerged the most outstanding Ghanaian athlete. He won both the first and second round heats in the 100 metres in 10.33 secs and 10.12 secs to reach the semi-finals.




Team officials believed that the draw of lanes in the semis which put Myles Mills next to the indomitable Carl Lewis of the US, would inspire him. Instead he appeared overawed and tensed up and was surprisingly left behind on the starting blocks as the gun went. In the event Myles Mills finished last in the semis with a time of 10.43 secs having clocked 10 33 secs and 10.21 secs earlier in the heats.


Again in the 200 metres Myles Mills qualified for the second round heats by placing 4th behind Italy’s Stefano Tolli, Carl Lewis and Nigeria’s Olapide Adenikan in 21.04 secs. Then in the quarter finals he finished 6th but didn’t qualify for the semi-finals because his time of 20.95 secs was a shade slower than Belgium’s Patrick Stephens. 


The men’s 100×4 relay quartet of Eric Akogyeram, Nelson Boateng, Salam Gariba and Myles Mills qualified for the semis finishing third behind the Soviet Union and West Germany in 39.13 secs, the 6th fastest of the 14 qualifiers.


The Ghanaians were hopeful of a medal following the disqualification of the strong US team for changing the last baton in the wrong zone whilst winning their first round heats. Poor baton changing however cost Ghana and the team placed fifth in the semis in 39. 46 secs earning an overall 12th position in the rankings. All the first eight clocked under 39 secs.




Triple jumper Francis Dodoo failed to make it to the second round. He managed a poor 16.88 metres after four attempts and thus failed to qualify for the second round.


In the women’s division top star Diana Yankey didn’t have much of a chance in the sprints. Running against the likes of super star Florence Griffiths Joyner the Olympic and world record holder and Evelyn Ashford both of the US. However, she managed to qualify for the second heats where she was eliminated by placing last in 11.64 secs. Also in the women’s 100m metres hurdles Diana Yankey failed to qualify for the second round when she placed 4th in her heats. Her time of 13. 64 secs put her in the 24th ranking out of 33 starters and was not good enough for her to advance.


In the women’s long jump, 16-year-old US-based student Juliana Yendork finished 27th among 29 competitors.


She fell at the end of the first round but one expected Yendork gaining inspiration having compelled against top class athletes like Olympic record holder Jackie Joyner Kersey.




The women’s sprints relay quartet of Veronica Bawuah, Diana Yankey, Mercy Addy and Marha Appiah crashed out in the semis after running the 13th fastest time of 44.12 secs in the quarter finals.


In table tennis young Patricia Akosua Ofei lost all her four matches to place 6th and last in her group Patricia lost 3-1 to Australian Kerry Tapier 21-19, 21-12, 20-22, 21-16. Lost 3-1 to Wai Cheng Lau of Malaysia,18-21, 21-18, 21-17, 21-17 beaten 3-1 by Ka Sha Kok of Hong Kong 21-18, 18-21, 21-17, 21-17 and then 3-0 to Kiyomib Ishida of Japan 20-22,16-21,15-21.


For young Akos, the experience gained by facing top class opposition from China, Malaysia and Japan proved invaluable. She rose to become a national star.


Next episode 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

Injured Murray not made decision on Wimbledon farewell,"Andy Murray has not made a decision on whether he will be fit enough to make a planned Wimbledon farewell next week.


The 37-year-old Briton had a procedure on a back issue at the weekend.


Murray is set to retire later this year and hopes for a final appearance at Wimbledon, where he won two of his three Grand Slam titles.


""Following his surgery on Saturday, Andy is continuing to work with his medical team to confirm when he will return to the court,"" Murray's team said in a statement.


""At this stage, no decisions have been made and we will update further as soon as anything has been finalised.""




Wimbledon, where Murray became the first British men's singles champion in 77 years when he won in 2013, begins on 1 July.


A report in the Telegraph, external on Sunday said Murray would not be able to compete after having surgery on a spinal cyst.


Murray would not confirm the nature of the procedure when asked by BBC Sport.


Before his back issue flared up at Queen's last week, the Scot had intended to play in the singles and doubles - alongside his brother Jamie - at the All England Club.




Murray has also been selected for Great Britain at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.


The tennis event starts on 27 July on the clay courts at Roland Garros.


Murray, also a two-time Olympic gold medallist, said earlier in June that retiring at Wimbledon or the Olympics would be ""fitting"", given his success in both events.


He had previously said he was ""not planning to play much beyond the summer"" but did not confirm what would be his final tournament.




Andy Murray was the first British men's singles champion in 77 years when he won Wimbledon in 2013


Why Wimbledon means so much to Murray


Wimbledon has been the scene of some of Murray's greatest moments on the court.


Weeks after the emotional defeat by Roger Federer in the 2012 final, and the teary post-match interview that changed public opinion of him, Murray returned to win Olympic gold on Centre Court against the same opponent.


That triumph set the platform for Murray to end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's Wimbledon champion in 2013, with victory over world number one Novak Djokovic.


In 2016, he became Wimbledon champion for a second time, beating Milos Raonic in what would ultimately become the best year of his career - ending up as the world number one for the first time.




So it is little surprise Murray wants to give himself as much time as possible to make what is expected to be a fond farewell on Centre Court.


With the main draw for the men's singles taking place at 10am on Friday, it appears Murray is giving himself the rest of the week to see how he responds to the surgery before making a decision.


How Murray ended up in latest fitness battle


Murray, who thought in 2019 he would have to retire because of a hip injury, knows there is no perfect ending to a tennis career.


But it would feel cruel if the best British player of his generation is not able to say goodbye on home turf as planned - fully fit and perhaps with one last hurrah.




Rupturing ankle ligaments at the Miami Open in March - shortly after Murray said he did not intend to play much past the summer and just as he began to show signs of resurgent form - was a big blow.


After returning on the clay seven weeks later, he started struggling with a problem on the left side of his back, where he had surgery in 2013, and said he has ""degenerative"" issues.


At Queen's, where he had to stop playing after five games of his second-round match against Australia's Jordan Thompson, Murray said he suffered ""nerve-type discomfort"" on the right side.


Murray said it caused a ""loss of strength, coordination and control"" in his right leg.




""I hadn't experienced that before,"" he added.

Djokovic will only play Wimbledon if he can fight for title,"Novak Djokovic says he will only play at this year's Wimbledon if he can ""fight for the title"", but his recovery from knee surgery is going ""in the right direction"".


The seven-time champion tore the medial meniscus in his right knee at the French Open and had surgery less than three weeks ago.


He intends to decide on whether he will play at this year's Championships, which start on 1 July, before the draw is made on Friday.


He trained for nearly two hours at Wimbledon on Monday, with a support bandage on his knee, and said afterwards that it was ""great"" to be back at the All England Club.


""I didn’t come here to play a few rounds,"" the 37-year-old told BBC Sport after his session.




""If I know I can play close to my maximum or at maximum, then I'll play. If not, then I'll give somebody else a chance to play.""


Adding he ""liked his trajectory so far"", Djokovic said: ""I really will only play if I know I am in a state which is good enough to go far in the tournament and fight for the title, so that's the condition.""


Cameras were trained on Djokovic as he practised his groundstrokes, serving and volleying on the Aorangi practice courts.


He was hitting with Argentina's Federico Coria, and the pair played two tie-breaks, the first of which Djokovic won and the second he lost.




""Rehab is going in the right direction every single day, a few per cent better and better. That's what's giving me hope and encouragement to keep going,"" he said.


""I'm taking things gradually. I'm not pushing myself yet 100% but I'm hoping that's going to come in the next few days.""


Should he play at Wimbledon this year, Djokovic would be making his 19th appearance at the grass-court Grand Slam.


He has reached the Wimbledon final for the past five years, losing the 2023 showpiece to Carlos Alcaraz in a memorable five-set match on Centre Court.




Later this summer, Djokovic will represent Serbia at the Paris Olympics as he targets the gold medal that has so far eluded him.


Paris will mark his fifth Olympics but he has only won a bronze medal, at his first Games in Beijing in 2008.

Sinner wins first title as world number one,"Jannik Sinner claimed his first title as world number one with victory over Hubert Hurkacz at the Halle Open.


Italy's Sinner won his first Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January and replaced Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings earlier in June.


He secured his first grass-court title with a 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-2) victory against Poland's Hurkacz, who he also played doubles with in Germany.


Sinner has lost just three matches this season - falling twice to Carlos Alcaraz at the French Open and Indian Wells, and being beaten by Stefanos Tsitsipas in Monte Carlo.


He will be the top seed at Wimbledon, which begins on 1 July, as he looks to go one step further than his semi-final showing from last year.




""I'm just looking forward to Wimbledon. Last year I made the semis, I played some good tennis, so let's see what's coming this year,"" the 22-year-old said.


""I'm more confident for sure. Obviously the grass might be a bit different from here and Wimbledon.


""But I have one week now to prepare, so hopefully it's going to be a good tournament.”


Jannik Sinner was playing in his first tournament as the world number one


Paul becomes American number one with Queen's win




Elsewhere, Tommy Paul claimed the biggest title of his career so far with a 6-1 7-6 (10-8) triumph over Lorenzo Musetti at Queen's.


The American also became his nation's top-ranked men's player with victory, having moved to 12th in the world rankings.


Paul quickly overpowered Italy's Musetti, hitting just two unforced errors on his way to wrapping up the first set.


Victory at Queen's secured Tommy Paul his second title of the year


He went an early break up in the second but tightened up when serving for the match at 5-4, allowing Musetti to break back and ultimately force a tie-break.




However, Paul's big serve again got him out of trouble and he secured victory on his third match point.


Paul is the first American to win the Queen's title since Sam Querrey in 2010.


In the doubles final, Britain's Neal Skupski and New Zealander Michael Venus came from a set down to beat Russian Karen Khachanov and American Taylor Fritz 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 10-8.

Draper beats defending champion Alcaraz at Queens,"Jack Draper says winning his first ATP title set him ""free"" of negativity and led to his stunning victory over Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz at Queen's.


New British men's number one Draper, 22, earned a 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 victory over defending champion Alcaraz in the second round.


Spain's Alcaraz, 21, saved three match points at 5-2 before Draper served out from 0-30 to the delight of an ecstatic home crowd.


It continued a memorable week for Draper after he claimed the first ATP title of his career at the Stuttgart Open on Sunday.


On Monday, he was confirmed as his nation's leading player on the men's tour.




""There was such a bee in my bonnet about winning an ATP event,"" said Draper, who lost finals in Sofia and Adelaide before triumphing in Stuttgart.


""To get the title last week set me free of negative emotions and a lot of the pressure I've been putting on myself.""


Beating world number two Alcaraz - who claimed the French Open earlier this month - is the biggest win of Draper's career by ranking.


He also ended three-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz's streak of 13 straight wins on grass.




""Coming to Queen's for a home tournament, being British number one, you would think would put more stress on my shoulders - but it is the opposite,"" added Draper.


""I feel calm and relaxed because I know I'm doing the right things. I trust in my tennis and know I'm going to be tough to beat.""


Draper, who extended his winning run to seven matches, will play American fifth seed Tommy Paul in the quarter-finals on Friday.


'Draper passes the Alcaraz test which he relished'







This match-up was a tantalising prospect which instantly caught the eye when the draw was made at the weekend.


The Wimbledon champion versus Britain's most promising hope.


Draper has made great strides over the past year, since coming back from the shoulder injury which ruled him out of the entire British grass-court swing last year.


Facing Alcaraz was a test of his progress – and he passed with flying colours.




Draper’s work in recent months to be more aggressive with his explosive game, and dominating his opponent in the rallies, was seen in a confident display.


His mentality was equally impressive. Draper looked composed and focused throughout, rising to an occasion that he relished without overexcitement compromising his execution.


""You have to go out there and honestly believe you can win the match - that’s what I did,"" he said.


After sealing victory, Draper initially remained cool as he shook hands with Alcaraz but released his emotion seconds later with a huge leap into the air.




The passionate reaction of the Queen's crowd showed their elation at seeing another British star emerge.


Draper's development has been timely given the void which is set to be created by Andy Murray's impending retirement.


Even Murray, who is set to retire from the sport later this year aged 37, has stoked the excitement by backing Draper to go ""right to the top"" of the sport.


""The more times you come through these tough moments, against great players like Carlos, the more you start to believe you can do things that you thought were impossible,"" Draper added.




""The more times I come through these matches, the more I believe I can go to the top.""


How Draper has emerged as Britain's leading man


With every significant step he takes in his career, interest in Draper continues to grow.


The left-handed Londoner has been well known in British tennis circles for a long time, through strong family connections and his eye-catching talent.


Draper's mother Nicky - who the player credits as one of his biggest influences - is a coach and former junior champion, while father Roger was the chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association.




Draper first caught the attention of a wider British public with a run to the Wimbledon junior final in 2018.


After turning professional, he earned notable tour wins over top-10 opponents and took a set off Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2021.


But Draper's progress was regularly hampered by fitness issues and retirements from matches.


Now, having dropped out of the top 100 last year, he is going from strength-to-strength and will be seeded at Wimbledon next month.


""In the last couple of weeks it's starting to come together exactly at the right time when I want it,"" he said.


""There is no place I'd rather be than here in London, here on the grass, playing in front of a home crowd. It feels amazing.""

Alcaraz starts Queens defence with win,"Carlos Alcaraz continued where he left off on the British grass by starting his Queen's title defence with a straight-set victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.


The 21-year-old Spaniard won 6-1 7-5 in his first match on grass since lifting the Wimbledon title last year.


Alcaraz won the third major of his career on the French Open clay earlier this month, before switching back to the surface where he has played the least.


It looked a comfortable transition initially, but he ran into difficulty in his first-round match against 26th-ranked Cerundolo.


But the world number two recovered to earn his 12th straight win on a grass court.




""It doesn't matter what tournaments I'm playing, or everything I have achieved, I am still learning,"" said Alcaraz.


""Every time I step on a grass court I need to learn how to move better and play better.""


Alcaraz dropped just 14 points in a one-sided first set before fighting back from a break down at 5-2 in the second.


Cerundolo could not serve out at 5-3 and had three set points at 5-4.




But he struck two backhands into the net, either side of Alcaraz saving the second with an ace, as the Spaniard escaped to hold for 5-5.


That proved costly as Alcaraz broke for 6-5 and served out to love.


""The first match in every tournament is never easy but even more difficult here on grass,"" said Alcaraz.


""Starting the grass season you want a good result and you have to deal with the expectations you put on yourself.




""It was a good test against Francisco. I'm really happy with what I've done and hopefully can keep going.""


Alcaraz will play new British number one Jack Draper in the second round after the 22-year-old beat Argentina's Mariano Navone.


Sinner battles back to win at Halle


New world number one Jannik Sinner had to come from behind to win his opening match at the Halle Open in Germany.


The Italian, who replaced Novak Djokovic as the top-ranked men's player following his run to the French Open semi-finals, recovered to beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-7 (8-10) 6-3 6-2.




""It was for sure mentally tough,"" Australian Open champion Sinner, who faces Hungarian Fabian Marozsan next, said.


""I was 5-1 up in the tie-break in the first set. But this can happen, especially on this surface, it can go very, very fast.


""I was struggling in the second set, 0-40 down on my serve. If he makes that point, it is even more difficult.""


There were also victories for German second seed Alexander Zverev and Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.




Zverev, beaten by Alcaraz in the French Open final earlier this month, also had to come back from a set down to win 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-4 against compatriot Oscar Otte.


Tsitsipas came through two tie-breaks against German Henri Squire to clinch a 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-2) victory.


However, Russian fourth seed Andrey Rublev is out following a straight-set loss to American Marcos Giron.


Rublev, runner up in 2021 and last year, was beaten 6-4 7-6 (7-5).

Djokovic to compete at Paris Olympics,"Novak Djokovic will compete at the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Olympic Committee of Serbia has announced.


This summer will be his fifth Olympic appearance, having competed in every Games since 2008.


Djokovic, 37, won bronze at his first Olympics but has lost the third-place match twice in his three appearances since.


In April, he said Paris 2024 is ""a priority"" for him this year as he targets an elusive gold medal.


The Games will be Djokovic's first appearance in Paris since the Serbian withdrew from the French Open last month with a knee injury before his quarter-final.




The tennis events in Paris will be held at Roland Garros, the home of the French Open, between 27 July and 4 August.


Several countries have confirmed their line-up for tennis events.


Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal are set to compete against Djokovic with the Briton saying it would be ""fitting"" to retire at the Games.


Ons Jabeur and Aryna Sabalenka, the world number 10 and three respectively, have said that they will not compete in the women's tournament to prioritise their health.




World number 56 Dusan Lajovic will also represent Serbia.

"18yr old Ayisha, Ghartey win 2024 Panafrican Komatsu Golf Tournament","An eighteen-year-old beneficiary of the Captain One Golf Society’s kids project, Ayishatu Amidu, has won her second major competition at the Nsuta Golf Club during the 2024 Panafrican Komatsu Golf Tournament. 


She won her first tournament about a fortnight ago during the Latex Foam monthly medal played at the Royal Golf Club, Kumasi, her affiliated club. 


She won the ladies’ group after playing handicap 25 and returning a score of 30 points to emerge the overall winner in the group. 


She was followed by Ruth Menz who played with handicap 24 and returned with a score of 26 points while Felicity Kuranthie-Mensah playing with handicap 24 also returned with 38 points to place third. 


In the men’s group, Mr Samuel Ghartey, a member of the Captain One Golf Society emerged as the overall winner with a score of 76 while Daniel Peprah losing on countback finished second with the same score of 76. 




James Akwaboah placed third with a score of 78. 


In Group B, Mr Kofi Otchere Kurankye topped the group with 36 points with a handicap of 27 while Roland Quainoo with a handicap of 24 came second with 35 points, and Samuel Koomson playing with a handicap of 13 finished third with 35 points.





Speaking in an interview with the media, Mr Mark M. G.  Kruger, Panafrican Komtsu General Manager for Ghana and Sierra Leone said he was excited about the tournament since this was their first time sponsoring the tournament. 


He added that he was looking for future sponsorships and applauded Ghana’s talents in golf saying, “I am very impressed with the talents in Ghana.”




The outgoing captain of the Nsuta Golf Club, Mr Alexander Bewong, said he was happy with the turnout and was happy about the course. 


He said although he was stepping back as the captain, he would avail himself to support the incoming captain for the club to be active. 


An excited Ayisha Amidu thanked the leaders and members of the Captain One Golf Society for their effort in making her realise her talent and acknowledged the tactics and strategies of her coaches. 


She said she was willing to take lessons from her seniors and competitors on the course to better herself since she had just started her golfing career.

Rory McIlroy and wife end divorce proceedings to stay together as a family,"Rory McIlroy and his wife Erica have scrapped plans to divorce and are putting their marriage back together. They filed for a voluntary dismissal of the case on Tuesday.


It was another dramatic turn of events for McIlroy. News broke when he arrived at the last major in May they had filed for divorce. And two days before the U.S. Open came news that divorce proceedings were closed in a filing in Palm Beach County, Florida.


In a statement to The Guardian in the UK, McIlroy said, “There have been rumours about my personal life recently, which is unfortunate. Responding to each rumour is a fool’s game.


“Over the past weeks, Erica and I have realized that our best future was as a family together. Thankfully, we have resolved our differences and look forward to a new beginning.”


They have one daughter, Poppy, who turns 4 in September.




McIlroy put out a statement at the PGA Championship confirming the divorce and his desire to keep a difficult time respectful and amicable. He made no mention of it during his press conference earlier Tuesday.

Danny List secures land for Ghanas first golf academy,"Ghanaian international Golfer and founder of Danny List Foundation, Danny List, announced on Sunday that his foundation has secured a parcel of land for the establishment of a golf academy in Ghana.


The project, which is first of its kind in West Africa is expected to contribute immensely to the development of golf in Ghana and the entire sub-region .





The project that comes at an estimated cost of over 500,000 dollars when completed, will offer the opportunity to young people in Ghana and the West African sub-region to train and develop their talents in golf.


This was disclosed by Danny List when he organized a two-hour golf orientation workshop for 60 junior golfers at the Achimota Golf Pitch at Achimota in Accra.


He said architects and surveyors will soon move to the site to start work on the architectural design of the facility towards its sod cutting in the coming months.







Danny List took the junior golfers through various essential  techniques he uses on the golf course.


The children, drawn from both public and private schools within the Greater Accra Region had the opportunity to display their talents which overwhelmed the international golfer.





On her part, the Chairperson of the Foundation, Madam Angela List said It is amazing to see some the  children aged 3 and 4 demonstrating their talent in golf.


She noted there are some of them who are  really passionate about golf and pledged her support for them.




Danny List is the only West African playing professional golf at the highest level, the PGA Tour, the world’s premier membership organization for touring professional golfers.





Danny List grew up in Ghana and had a stellar start to his young career.


Although he started as a football player at age 12, his passion for golf dominated his time. He then received multiple scholarship offers to play college golf in the US, ultimately choosing to attend the University of Washington.


After turning professional at 19, he still carries Ghana’s golfing hopes on his shoulders and is flying high the flag of the Black Star of Africa.

African Games 2023: Sports Minister urges continental bodies to host more competitions in Ghana,"Ghana’s Minister for Youth and Sports, Mustapha Ussif, has called on continental bodies to host more sporting competitions in Accra, which has been declared the Sports City of Africa until the next African Games by the African Union.


The Yagaba-Kubori Member of Parliament is saying this on the back of Ghana’s successful hosting of the 13th African Games from the 5th to the 23rd of March 2024.


After a rocky start to the organization of the games, the Local Organizing Committee recovered and did a job that has attracted praise from many.


Speaking at the closing ceremony at the University of Ghana Sports Stadium on Saturday, Ussif expressed confidence that the facilities that hosted the African Games can also host other high-profile competitions.


“After the declaration of Accra as the Sports City of Africa from 2024 and beyond, I take this opportunity to invite confederations, federations and the International Olympic Committee to organise competitions here in Accra.




“I want to assure the good people of Ghana that we will build on the unprecedented success Ghana has achieved.”


The University of Ghana Sports Stadium was completed and hosted the track and field events, with new facilities also built at the Borteyman Sports Complex to host tennis, swimming, and others.

Ken Bediako: Ghana and the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games,"This was the first “full scale,” Olympics since the past three boycott prone Olympiads of Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980 and Angeles 1984. A record 159 countries were in the South Korean capital for the biggest sports festival on the planet.


Ghana entered three disciplines, boxing, athletics and table tennis. Even though a couple of the boxers and athletes showed much improvement their performances were not good enough to win any medals.


The four-man boxing squad of flyweight Alfred Kotey, lightweight Ike Quartey, Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah (captain) and Lightmiddleweight


Emmanuel Quaye. All the boxers had an early boost when all of them luckily drew a bye in the first round.


Alfred Ankamah inspired his colleagues with one of the fastest knockouts in the tournament when he stopped Jay Smbeye of Malawi in 1 min 15 secs in the first round. A terrific right caught the Malawian flush on the jaw and he dropped heavily on his back to be counted out.




Flyweight Alfred Kotey followed suit with another first round win for Ghana over Husain Almuntari of Kuwait. The referee stepped in at 2mins 43secs to save the clearly outclassed Kuwaiti from undue punishment.


Lightweight Ike Quartey also won with unanimous decision over Saizozena of Dominican Republic. Ike did well but his stamina appeared suspect in the closing stages of the fight.
















Lightmiddleweight Emmanuel Quaye, lost to Lauren’s Mercando of Equador. Quaye was just too inexperienced and not even the fact that his opponent was given a public warning in the second round for persistently hitting with open gloves, could make any difference. Quaye was given a standing count as round three began and it was obvious that he couldn’t last. It was not surprising therefore when he was decked just before the end of the round to be counted out.


In his second fight, Flyweight Alfred Kotey produced a blistering double fisted attack to score a unanimous points victory against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath. He dominated the Tanzanian in the first two rounds but the Tanzanian came out strongly in the third round. In hot exchanges late in the round, the Tanzanian opened a cut on the left cheek of Kotey but Kotey had done enough to get the verdict.




Lightweight Ike Quartey lost his second fight to Australia’s Grabane Chevey in a close contest. The first round was even and Ike won the second round. The third was also quite close but when the scores were called, the Australian had been made winner by all the five officials. Most Journalists were of the opinion that, perhaps the aggressive brawling tactics of the Australian might have bamboozled the judges. Ike Quartey obviously felt cheated and he dramatically staged a mini protest by refusing to leave the ring for a couple of minutes. He eventually left after bowing out amidst applause from the crowd.


Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah also lost his second fight against American Kenneth Gould. The American, stronger and much more muscular, was the better boxer Right from round one, he established his superiority proving too elusive for Ankamah to catch with any of his usual bombs. Ankamah was however courageous and determined to fight but he never really found an antidote to Gould’s tactics. The unanimous verdict was never in dispute.


The biggest setback to the boxing team was when medal hopeful Alfred Kotey was declared unfit at the ringside moments before his quarter final bout against Mexican Gonzales. The medical commission of AIBA (International Amateur Boxing Association) ruled that a cut which Kotey had sustained in the previous fight against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath and which had been stitched, was unsafe for the Ghanaian to fight. All attempts by the Ghanaian officials to have the ruling reversed failed. Team physician Dr Forjour was particularly a sad person for sanctioning the stitching of Kotey’s cut.


In athletics, sprinter Leo Myles Mills emerged the most outstanding Ghanaian athlete. He won both the first and second round heats in the 100 metres in 10.33 secs and 10.12 secs to reach the semi-finals.




Team officials believed that the draw of lanes in the semis which put Myles Mills next to the indomitable Carl Lewis of the US, would inspire him. Instead he appeared overawed and tensed up and was surprisingly left behind on the starting blocks as the gun went. In the event Myles Mills finished last in the semis with a time of 10.43 secs having clocked 10 33 secs and 10.21 secs earlier in the heats.


Again in the 200 metres Myles Mills qualified for the second round heats by placing 4th behind Italy’s Stefano Tolli, Carl Lewis and Nigeria’s Olapide Adenikan in 21.04 secs. Then in the quarter finals he finished 6th but didn’t qualify for the semi-finals because his time of 20.95 secs was a shade slower than Belgium’s Patrick Stephens. 


The men’s 100×4 relay quartet of Eric Akogyeram, Nelson Boateng, Salam Gariba and Myles Mills qualified for the semis finishing third behind the Soviet Union and West Germany in 39.13 secs, the 6th fastest of the 14 qualifiers.


The Ghanaians were hopeful of a medal following the disqualification of the strong US team for changing the last baton in the wrong zone whilst winning their first round heats. Poor baton changing however cost Ghana and the team placed fifth in the semis in 39. 46 secs earning an overall 12th position in the rankings. All the first eight clocked under 39 secs.




Triple jumper Francis Dodoo failed to make it to the second round. He managed a poor 16.88 metres after four attempts and thus failed to qualify for the second round.


In the women’s division top star Diana Yankey didn’t have much of a chance in the sprints. Running against the likes of super star Florence Griffiths Joyner the Olympic and world record holder and Evelyn Ashford both of the US. However, she managed to qualify for the second heats where she was eliminated by placing last in 11.64 secs. Also in the women’s 100m metres hurdles Diana Yankey failed to qualify for the second round when she placed 4th in her heats. Her time of 13. 64 secs put her in the 24th ranking out of 33 starters and was not good enough for her to advance.


In the women’s long jump, 16-year-old US-based student Juliana Yendork finished 27th among 29 competitors.


She fell at the end of the first round but one expected Yendork gaining inspiration having compelled against top class athletes like Olympic record holder Jackie Joyner Kersey.

African Games 2023: Minority clashes with Majority in Parliament over competition expenditure,"Ghana’s Parliament witnessed a heated disagreement between the Minority and Majority groups on Tuesday, June 25, over the expenditure for the 2023 African Games held in Ghana.


The Sports Minister, Mustapha Ussif, presented a report to the House about the continental event, which took place from March 8-23, 2024.


However, the report did not include details about the amount spent.


The Minority in Parliament, led by Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, criticized Ussif and demanded full details on the expenditure.


Dr Forson said: “We know for sure $15 million was allocated to a company called M and L Company Limited for 18 days of feeding, that amounts to 226 million cedis for 18 days.




“You cannot come here and deliver a statement without accounting for $15 million for 18 days. This is public money.”


Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa also quizzed: ""There is no mention of how much this country has spent on the games. What is honourable minister concealing from this house? What is he hiding?.""


In response, Majority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin said the Minority’s priorities are misplaced.


“Instead of commending the Minister for a good job done, you want to use the opportunity to critique and say things that are not factual.”




Former Majority Leader Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu defended the Sports Minister, arguing that adequate time is needed to account for the expenditure. 


“You cannot say that within two weeks or three weeks, the Minister should be able to come before this house and explain everything. The Minority Leader, fortunately, is an accountant and he understands these things.”


Ghana won 69 medals at the competition, which was hosted on home soil for the first time in the country’s history.

Borteyman Sports Complex was not rented out for Church programme  Venue Manager,"The Venue Manager of the newly constructed Borteyman Sports Complex, Majeed Bawa, has firmly denied recent media reports suggesting that the facility was used for a Church programme.


In a statement addressing the issue, Bawa clarified the circumstances surrounding the event in question and expressed concern over the misleading information.


According to Bawa, a letter received from the Student Representative Councils (SRCs) of the University of Ghana, University of Professional Studies, Valley View University, and other institutions requested a special visitation to the Borteyman Sports Complex.


The visit was part of a tour of Accra's newest attraction, with the purpose of familiarizing the students with the facilities.


""The SRCs intended to tour the facilities at the venue,"" Bawa explained.




""A church was supposed to provide transportation for the students, and subsequently, a deputy minister was scheduled to give them a lecture on leadership.


""Therefore, they were granted access to the hall for this purpose.""


On the day of the visit, the venue had just hosted a two-day Badminton competition, and the equipment was still in place.


The students entered the hall and were seated in anticipation of the deputy minister's lecture.




Bawa, who was present at the facility, noticed a Church banner in the hall, which was explained to him as a result of the Church's role in facilitating transportation.


NSA statement on use of Borteyman Sports Complex 


""It is important to note that there were many Muslim students in attendance, some of whom were wearing hijabs,"" Bawa emphasised, highlighting the diversity of the attendees.


The NSA Deputy Director General expressed surprise and disappointment at the reports suggesting the facility was handed out for a Church programme.


""There is a statement from the University of Ghana SRC apologising to the Muslim students who were part of this tour, clarifying that at no point was it intended for a Church programme.""




He concluded by apologising for any confusion and distress the misreports may have caused and assured the public that the Borteyman Sports Complex remains a facility dedicated to serving the diverse needs of the community.

University of Ghana hosts International Olympic Day celebration with PATH Ghana,"University of Ghana campus was abuzz with excitement as Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH Ghana), in collaboration with the International Olympic Community (IOC), celebrated International Olympic Day on 23 June 2024 at University campus.


The event commemorates the founding of the International Olympic Community (IOC) in 1894 and emphasizes the Olympic values of Respect, Friendship, and Excellence.


This year’s celebration is particularly significant as it coincides with an Olympic year, with the upcoming Games being hosted in France, the homeland of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympics. The theme for this year's event, “Let’s Move and Celebrate,” aims to inspire collective enthusiasm for the Paris 2024 Games by promoting physical activity and unity through sports.


The day’s festivities at the University of Ghana included a vibrant 5-kilometer health walk, accompanied by a brass band, to create an engaging atmosphere. Students and staff participated enthusiastically, carrying placards with messages of solidarity and awareness about the benefits of sports and physical activity for personal and communal health.















Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, emphasized the essence of the day, stating, “On this very special Olympic Day, let us celebrate the joy that only sports can give us.” The event echoed this sentiment, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and highlighting the power of sports to bring people together.


PATH Ghana, a global team of innovators dedicated to eliminating health inequities, spearheaded the event. They work in over 70 countries to advance health equity through innovation and partnerships. PATH's collaboration with the University of Ghana, along with the Sports Directorate and the Department of Physical Education and Sports Studies, underscores the importance of integrating sports into community health initiatives.


In addition to the University of Ghana, other notable participants included the Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC), the Ministries of Health, Youth, and Sports, as well as various state and non-state actors. This diverse coalition is part of the IOC-led Community-Based Sport and Health Cooperation Initiative, which aims to enhance physical, mental, and social health by increasing participation in organized community sports.


Olympic Games Paris 2024 kick starts July 26, 2024. Ghana is hopeful of winning Gold medal as athletes continue with their preparations.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

Euro 2024: Spain beat Georgia to set up quarterfinal tie with Germany,"Spain set up a blockbuster quarter-final tie with Euro 2024 hosts Germany by surviving an early scare to ease past Georgia.


Playing in their first major tournament, Georgia had to soak up heavy pressure from Spain early on but stunned those watching on at Cologne Stadium when they took a surprise lead after 18 minutes.


Spain defender Robin le Normand poked Otar Kakabadze's curling cross into his own net, finishing off a devastating counter-attack and silencing supporters behind their goal.


Substitutes warming up sprinted over to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who led Georgia's celebrations in the corner.


It sparked confidence in Georgia but Spain's pressure eventually paid off when Manchester City's Rodri drilled a shot into the bottom corner - beating goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who had another outstanding overall display.




Spain continued to excite in attack, stringing together countless chances, and capitalised when Fabian Ruiz nodded in a cross from 16-year-old Lamine Yamal.


Georgia continued to battle and Napoli winger Kvaratskhelia would have scored the goal of the tournament had his clever chip from the halfway line bounced a metre to the right instead of passing the post.


But despite Georgia's flair and unpredictability, Spain's accomplished possession game took control - Nico Williams striking powerfully into the roof of the net to make it 3-1, before Dani Olmo's precise finish capped things off.


European giants and home favourites Germany are up next for Spain in Stuttgart on Friday, while Georgia exit the competition after a fairytale run in which they massively exceeded expectations.

Euro 2024: England come from behind to beat Slovakia to advance to quarterfinals,"Jude Bellingham produced a moment of genius to keep England in Euro 2024 as they survived another desperate display and a huge scare to beat Slovakia in dramatic fashion to reach the last eight.


England were seconds away from an embarrassing exit in Gelsenkirchen as Slovakia defended a lead they had held since the 25th minute when Ivan Schranz raced into the box to poke a low finish past England keeper Jordan Pickford.


It was then that Bellingham, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Saturday, demonstrated the brilliance that has made him England’s new superstar by going airborne in the penalty area to send Marc Guehi’s headed flick past Martin Dubravka with a stunning overhead kick.


Bellingham rescued England from a performance that scaled such depths that his goal was their first effort on target – but then set the platform for a victory as Slovakia, who had defended so stubbornly, were left stunned.


And captain Harry Kane emphasised England’s sudden superiority a minute into the extra 30 minutes when he headed home from close range to complete a remarkable turnaround and set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland.




England’s display before Bellingham’s wonder goal was another to add to the catalogue of mediocrity they have delivered under Gareth Southgate in Germany, even though Kane had missed an easy header and Declan Rice struck a post as they strived for the equaliser.


Bellingham, the young man with the Midas touch, came up with the goods to save them at the death as England's stuttering Euro 2024 journey goes on.

Euro 2024: Havertz and Musiala score to take Germany to last 8,"Kai Havertz and Jamal Musiala scored as Euro 2024 hosts Germany reached the quarter-finals by beating Denmark in a game that was interrupted by a spectacular storm.


The last-16 tussle at Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion was suspended for around 20 minutes towards the end of the first half, as lightning lit up the sky and the pitch was soaked by hail and heavy rain.


But the game was also notable for calls by the video assistant referee, with Nico Schlotterbeck having had an early header ruled out by VAR, while Denmark were denied in the second half when Joachim Andersen's strike was chalked off as team-mate Thomas Delaney was flagged just offside.


Germany were celebrating another VAR call in their favour moments after the Danes' disallowed goal when referee Michael Oliver was called to the pitchside monitor and awarded a penalty for handball by Andersen.


Havertz put a cool spot-kick out of Kasper Schmeichel's reach to delight the passionate home fans.




The forward should have scored a second soon after when he clipped a shot over Schmeichel only to see it go wide, but Germany had their decisive second with just over 20 minutes remaining.


This time it was young star Musiala who got the goal as he raced through on the left and slotted into the far corner.


From then on the home fans were on their feet, roaring their side on for more goals, hoping they would really lay down a marker to suggest they might go all the way.


No more were forthcoming, but the Germany fans cheered their side passionately at the final whistle in celebration of this convincing win.




They will next play the winner of Sunday's game between Spain, who have looked one of the best sides so far at Euro 2024, and surprise package Georgia. That quarter-final is scheduled for Friday, 5 July.

Euro 2024: Switzerland stun defending champions Italy to reach last 8,"Holders Italy made a limp exit from Euro 2024 as a sparkling display from Switzerland helped them set up a potential quarter-final meeting with England.


The Swiss dominated from the start and took a deserved lead when the impressive Ruben Vargas crossed for Remo Freuler, who took a touch before hammering a low shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma.


Vargas, who plays his club football in Germany for Augsburg, made it 2-0 just 27 seconds into the second half when he picked up Michel Aebischer’s pass near the left-hand corner of the Italy area and expertly bent the ball into the far top corner of the net.


Italy did not manage a shot on target until the 73rd minute and their best effort before then came when Switzerland defender Fabian Schar headed Nicolo Fagioli’s cross against his own post, with Yann Sommer stranded.


Although Gianluca Scamacca also hit the woodwork from close range before the end, the Azzurri never seriously threatened a fightback and their forgettable campaign in Germany simply fizzled out.




While they head home, Switzerland, roared on in Berlin by their boisterous and frequently bouncing supporters, head for Dusseldorf where they will play the winners of England’s tie with Slovakia on Saturday, 6 July (16:00 GMT).

Belgium FA issues official apology to Mbappe after Amadou Onana pledges to kick France star,"Belgium have apologised after they posted a video of Amadou Onana chanting that he will target Kylian Mbappe's shin during their Euro 2024 clash.


WHAT HAPPENED?


The video showed the Everton midfielder alongside the Belgian-based comedian Pablo Andres singing about Mbappe. The comedian chanted: ""Who will tackle Mbappe in the shin?"" before Onana chanted in return, ""Onana, Amadou Onana!"" Following backlash, the Belgian FA deleted the video from all their social media accounts and issued an apology.





WHAT BELGIUM SAID


Before the pre-match press conference, Belgium's press officer Stefan Van Loock said: ""It was not the intention to attack anyone. We have been working with comedian Pablo Andres for a long time, this video also had to be funny.


""But we misjudged that and also took the video offline. We would like to apologise to anyone we may have offended with this. For us, this is the end of the matter.""





THE BIGGER PICTURE


The neighbouring nations and rivals face off in the European Championship round of 16 on Monday as Belgium look to get revenge for their 1-0 defeat in the 2018 World Cup semi-final. Although much of the 'golden generation' of Belgians have retired, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku have continued to display their strong connection - even if the latter has scored three disallowed goals. In contrast, France have yet to live up to their pre-tournament expectations.







WHAT NEXT FOR BELGIUM?


Onana will have the chance to make his mark on Mbappe and France on Monday as the Rode Duivels look to progress to the quarter-finals. The winner of the game will face the winner of Portugal and Slovenia in that game next weekend.

Copa America: Weah suffers racist abuse after red card in US loss,"The United States Soccer Federation condemned the online racist abuse suffered by several of its players following a 2-1 defeat by Panama at the Copa America.


Monaco striker Folarin Balogun, Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards and Juventus pair Timothy Weah and Weston McKennie were all targeted online after the hosts lost the Group C match in Atlanta.


Weah, 24, was shown a straight red card in the 18th minute after punching Panama's Roderick Miller in the head in an off-the-ball incident.


The former Lille winger, who apologised to his team-mates for the incident, said it was a ""moment of frustration"".


US Soccer said in a statement on X: ""There is absolutely no place in the game for such hateful and discriminatory behaviour.




""These actions are not only unacceptable but also contrary to the values of respect and inclusivity that we uphold as an organisation.""


Despite Panama's numerical advantage, it was the US that took the lead at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium through a superb strike from Balogun - his fifth goal in 14 appearances for the US.





The lead lasted just four minutes as Cesar Blackman equalised from the edge of the box for Panama, who are 43rd in the Fifa world rankings.


The US, ranked 11th, defended admirably but Panama's pressure told seven minutes from time as Jose Fajardo netted from close range.




Shortly before full-time, Panama were also reduced to 10 men when Adalberto Carrasquilla was shown a red card for a reckless swipe on winger Christian Pulisic.


The US, who co-host the men's World Cup in 2026 with Canada and Mexico, are now level on points with Panama heading into their final group match against Uruguay on 2 July at 02:00 BST.


The US, who have a better goal difference, need to match Panama's result against Bolivia to progress to the last 16.

Referees Manager Alex Kotey calls for expanded live tv coverage to improve officiating,"The top-flight competition has faced widespread criticism for controversial decisions in the just-ended season. 


The awarding of goals and decisions by referees, especially on the final day of the season, sparked suggestions of match-fixing. 


Kotey acknowledged existing limitations in broadcasting capacity but advocated for expansion.


""[I wish] all our matches can be televised live because when there is a live match, the attention and focus is on you [referee],"" he told Asempa FM. 


""You will also not want [to commit blunders], but here again, it is up to the sponsors. They think that they cannot show all the matches. 




They can show about four matches. I think going forward, if we can expand a little bit to get more coverage, it will help.""


StarTimes, who are the exclusive rights holder for the league after signing a $5.25 million agreement in 2020, are rumored to have terminated the deal. 


As a result, the Ghana Football Association is currently seeking a new partner.

IKF Ghana and Togos MUAY Thai Association seal historic partnership,"The International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) Ghana has entered a groundbreaking partnership with the Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo.


The collaboration was officially announced at a ceremony in Togo on Wednesday, June 26 where IKF President, Ahmed Ibrahim and Henry Jallah, Technical Director of Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo, formalised the alliance, which is set to last for five years.


According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the Association Togolese de MUAY Thai Lome Togo will provide hospitality, free competition venues, training workshops, and championship opportunities for Ghanaian kickboxing and combat sports athletes.


The agreement also includes commitments to extend both cash and in-kind support to each other.


President Ahmed Ibrahim highlighted the importance of this partnership, describing it as a crucial step toward the IKF’s mission to revitalise the sport. 




“This partnership signifies another significant step in our forward march towards securing the necessary logistics to advance our goal of making the sport better for all,” he said.


The two African nations have received invitations to tournaments in Brazil and the USA later this year. 


IKF Ghana will participate with two fighters, Abdul Hadi Sani and Salom Darku, while Togo will send three fighters: Zikpli Nassdoechic Adams, Cynthia Jabidar, and Begzy Karttikeya.

"Kamaldeen Sulemanas potential at the same level as Jeremy Doku, Vinicius Jr  Tom Vernon","Founder of the Right to Dream Academy, Tom Vernon, believes Kamaldeen Sulemana’s talent is at the same level as Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr and Jeremy Doku of Man City.


The skill sets of these three players are indeed similar, but the Brazilian and Belgian wingers currently lead the Black Stars winger in terms of career progression.


Kamaldeen Sulemana’s development has stalled over the last season due to recurring injuries and has only featured 25 league games, starting only ten of them.


The 22-year-old winger finished the season with three assists, without a goal for Southampton en route to their quick Premier League return.


Sulemana was touted as one of the brightest wingers in the world in his early days at Nordsjaelland and Rennes.




Despite the recent setbacks, Tom Vernon believes he would still become a world class player.


""I think, you know, it's the old expression, form is temporary, and class is permanent,"" he told Joy Sports.


""And for Kamal, like if you watch Jeremy Doku, if you watch Vinicius Jr training, their potential compared to Kamal, talking about a player in the same ballpark, obviously in certain phases of their development, they pushed a little bit.


""But, you know, with modern day, most footballers will still be playing when they're 36, 37.




""So he's right at the start of the journey still. And he has everything that it takes. So even I watched the game against Central African Republic.


""If you look at positioning, timing of runs, everything, he was the one who was supposed to score.


""So, of course, everybody will focus on the actual finishing. But the real thing is right time, right position, and all that type of stuff. He's a world class player.""


“If you watch Jeremy Doku and Vinicius Jr, their potential compared to Kamal, you are talking about a player in the same ballpark. He is a world class player.”Right Dream Founder, Tom Vernon, with huge praise for Kamaldeen Sulemana.#JoySports pic.twitter.com/RgDNdOyVWL

Kamaldeen Sulemana played alongside Jeremy Doku at Stade Rennes before the Belgium winger of Ghanaian descent joined Man City last summer.

Kelvin Ofori is the best player Ive seen at Right to Dream Academy  Founder Tom Vernon,"Right to Dream Founder, Tom Vernon, has named Kelvin Ofori as the best player he ever saw at the Academy.


The now famous academy, which started over 20 years ago, has produced many great talents who have become world beaters.


Mohammed Kudus, Ernest Nuamah, Kamaldeen Sulemana, and Ibrahim Osman are the names of Right to Dream graduates on the lips of many Ghanaians now.


However, Tom Vernon has singled out 22-year-old Kelvin Ofori as the greatest talent to emerge from Right to Dream


“The best player I ever saw here was Kelvin Ofori. He signed in Germany, now he's playing in Slovakia. He was skillful,” Vernon told Joy Sports.




""He was, you know, I don't like it when people call me telling me that they have a Messi-type player because he was a left-footed in that style.


""But it changes, you know, different stages, different players develop and then what matters is when you're fully grown, like, how it is.


""But if you talk about academy football, that's the best player. Even at Man United, I never saw a player as good as Kelvin Ofori.""

Hearts of Oak involved in contract dispute with midfielder Salifu Ibrahim,"Hearts of Oak midfielder Salifu Ibrahim has been sacked from the club's training camp amid a dispute with the club's administration over his contract situation. 


Ibrahim is reportedly dissatisfied with his treatment by the club in the just-ended season and is currently unwilling to sign a new deal, as his agent, Benedict Asiedu, explained in an interview with Kessben FM. 


""It's about contract extension. We couldn't find an agreement because the player is hurt about certain things,"" he said. 


""The issues are that Hearts wanted to sell him to Nsoatreman FC without informing him, sidelining him for no reason. A new coach comes in, he plays him, and they tell the coach not to use him, and all that. If there is time for him to extend his contract, it will be difficult."" 


Asiedu claimed that two Hearts of Oak board members, Alhaji Akambi and Vincent Odotei Sowah, were responsible for the player's mistreatment. 




""Only Akambi and Odotei can explain why they were doing that."" 


Alhaji Akambi was quick in dispelling this claim, however. 


""The coach called me on the phone to tell me that he sacked some players including Salifu Ibrahim, that's what he told me. So when he has been told to go, what has that got to do with me and Odotei?,"" he told Kessben FM. 


He added that the source of the disagreement is the player's wage demands, as Ibrahim is demanding a pay of $2,500 after taxes, while the club quoted the same price but before taxes. 




""The figure he wants at net salary, I told him that we can only pay that as gross. I was waiting for him to get back to me but he was insisting on what he wanted. Asiedu called me after the player scored against Nsoatreman and told me that for anything less than $2,500, the boy would not play again. So I asked him, 'Is he the only player that will play?'"" 


Ibrahim joined the Phobians in 2021 and has since won five trophies with the club, including the Ghana Premier League in his first season, in which he also won the league MVP award. 


It is yet to be seen if this disagreement will lead to Ibrahim's permanent departure from the club.

Mohammed Kudus is a generational talent  Rev. Osei Kofi,"Renowned Ghanaian football legend Rev Osei Kofi has praised Mohammed Kudus, likening his talent and influence on the field to iconic players such as Lionel Messi and other Ghanaian greats.


Rev Kofi, reflecting on his own career and the roles of fellow legends Mohammed Polo and Abedi Pele, highlighted Kudus as a rare, generational talent.


“Some players are naturally talented,” Kofi said in the next episode of Prime Take with Muftawu Nabila Abdulai to be televised on Friday, June 28, 2024.


“Like [Lionel] Messi, when a team flops, he takes over to make things work. I was given that role by CK Gyamfi. Whenever the team flopped, I had to carry the team. We are about three of us who did that—myself, Polo, and Abedi.”


Kofi fondly remembered Polo’s synergy with the “fearsome five,” comprising strikers Peter Lamptey, Mahama Acquah, Anas Seidu, and Robert Hammond.




“Whenever Polo had the ball, the four would move, and he decided who to give the ball to. Such players are rare. After me, there was Polo who came. But now, we have someone like [Mohammed] Kudus. Players like that are generational talents.”


Emphasising the importance of recognizing and nurturing such talents, Rev Kofi pointed out a critical aspect of team dynamics.


“If the technical team were good enough, they would know this. You always have to build the team around an individual,” he said.


However, he noted a significant difference in the motivations of modern players compared to his era.




“We were amateurs; we played for the love of the game and for Ghana. But now, they are professionals, so they are playing for themselves to be bought.”


The first part Prime Take will now air every Friday at 7:30 am on the AM Show and Saturday at 7:30 PM with repeat on Sunday at 11 am on JoyNews.

Nacho joins Saudi Pro Leagues Al Qadsiah,"Nacho has joined Al Qadsiah on a two year deal after leaving Real Madrid, the Saudi Pro League club announced on Thursday.


The Spanish veteran defender, who captained Madrid to the Champions League and LaLiga double last season, will join the newly-promoted SPL side as a free agent after Euro 2024.


Nacho underwent a medical in Germany while on international duty with Spain ahead of his move to Saudi Arabia.


The 34-year-old, who joined Madrid as a 10-year-old, has won a joint-club record 26 trophies in his 12 seasons with the first team. His trophy haul includes six Champions League titles.


""I'm so grateful to Real Madrid,"" Nacho said at a Spain news conference on Thursday.




""Until a few days ago, I hadn't signed for my new club and Madrid told me they would be there if I changed my mind. I don't need a send off like [Toni] Kroos had to realise how much I'm loved.


""I always had clear that if I didn't finish my career at Madrid, I wouldn't want to play against them. I want to experience something new, something different. My life is going to be turned upside down but that's what I want. I'm very happy.""


Despite being in advanced talks with Saudi giants Al Ittihad, the veteran centre-back opted to sign for Al Qadsiah.


Nacho's coach at Al Qadsiah will be fellow Spaniard Michel, who guided the Khobar-based outfit to finish top of the first division league in his debut season at the club.




""I could have stayed one more year but there's nothing left to win with this jersey. It doesn't mean I'm lacking ambition. I thought it was the right time. I am calm and confident with the decision I've taken,"" Nacho said.

Elisha Owusu extends contract with AJ Auxerre till 2027,"Black Stars midfielder Elisha Owusu has agreed a contract extension with Ligue 2 winners Auxerre that will see him at the club until 2027.


As Auxerre's vice-captain, Owusu has decided to commit his future to the club following their promotion to the French top flight.


He made 33 appearances in Ligue 2 last season, scoring one goal and providing two assists.





Owusu joined Auxerre in 2021, but a nasty Achilles injury kept him sidelined for the rest of a Ligue 1 season that saw the club relegated.


He, however, bounced back from injury last season to became a pivotal part of Auxerre's set up.With the help of Black Stars compatriot Gideon Mensah, Owusu helped guide the team back into Ligue 1.

Euro 2024: All confirmed fixtures and schedule for last 16 games,"The road to Berlin is now set ahead of the last-16 stage at Euro 2024.


Hosts Germany finished top of Group A with Switzerland second after Niclas Fullkrug’s last-gasp equaliser in their last game. The Swiss will next play Italy, who snatched a late draw in Group B to join Spain in the next round on Monday night.


France shockingly failed to win Group D after being held to a dramatic draw by Poland, with Austria taking top spot instead following their stunning win over the Netherlands in Berlin.


England were already assured of a place in the last-16 when they sealed first place with a poor goalless draw with Slovenia, who joined Denmark in also making it through to the knockout stages. The third-placed league table fell in the Three Lions’ favour too, with Slovakia next up in the last-16.


A tense finish to Group E on Wednesday saw Ukraine sent home after a draw with Belgium, who face France up next. Portugal had already sealed top spot in Group F when losing to Georgia in their final game, sending the minnows through along with Turkey.




The 24-team tournament has now lost eight teams at the first hurdle. The top two of each group qualified automatically for the last-16 and the four top-ranked third-placed finishers have joined them in a pre-determined draw.

Paris 2024: Elaine Thompson-Herah out of Olympic Games with injury,"Elaine Thompson-Herah, the two-time Olympic champion in the 100m and 200m, will miss the Paris Olympics with an Achilles injury.


The 31-year-old Jamaican, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, sustained the injury at the New York City Grand Prix on 9 June and had to be carried off the track.


Thompson-Herah - the only sprinter other than compatriot Usain Bolt to win multiple Olympic titles in both the 100m and 200m - was aiming to defend her 100m crown after choosing not to race in the Jamaica 200m trials.


She said a ""small tear on my Achilles tendon"" ended her chances of competing at a third Olympics.


""It’s a long road but I am willing to start over and keep working and to make full recovery and resume my track career,"" Thompson-Herah wrote on Instagram.




""I am hurt and devastated to be missing the Olympics this year but at the end of the day it’s sports and my health comes first.""


Jamaicans have won the past four Olympic gold medals in the women's 100m.


Thompson-Herah won gold in the 100m and 200m in Rio in 2016 and defended her titles in Tokyo five years later.


She won a fifth Olympic gold in Japan as part of Jamaica's 4x100m relay team.

Ghana defender Jerome Opoku completes permanent move to Istanbul Basaksehir,"Black Stars defender Jerome Opoku has signed for Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir in a permanent deal from Arouca FC of Portugal. 


Opoku had initially signed for Basaksehir on a season-long loan last year, but the Super Lig side have decided to activate the option to buy clause in his loan contract that will see him at the club for another three years. 


Opoku made 28 appearances for Basaksehir last season, scoring four goals and keeping eight clean sheets. 


Opoku made his national team debut in a 4-0 friendly loss to the United States. 


His other two caps for Ghana came in a 2-2 draw with Uganda, in which he got sent off, and a 2-1 loss to Nigeria, in which he scored his first-ever international goal.

Euro 2024: Georgia shock Portugal to reach first knockouts,"Georgia made history and reached their first major tournament knockout stage with victory over Portugal at Euro 2024.


Portugal had already won the group, but were shocked in their final group stage game before the clock struck two minutes as Khvicha Kvaratskhelia drilled a low shot past Diogo Costa.


That goal came as Georgia hit Portugal on the break after overturning possession and set the tone for how much of the rest of the night would play out.


The underdogs did not require dominance and made their chances count as Georges Mikautadze delivered from the spot when they were handed a second-half penalty to further propel Georgia to their shock success.


Georgia were content with letting Portugal control possession - as they were steely in defence and closing down space to limit Portugal's chances - and waited for the opportunity to threaten on the counter.




Few opportunities came Georgia's way, but few of any real danger were handed to Portugal; the underdogs held their shape to perfection and caused the Group F winners to become increasingly frustrated.


Cristiano Ronaldo lacked the service to make the difference in the final third, Portugal's midfielders struggled to pass the ball in a way that did anything more than merely boost their possession statistics, and Georgia finished their group stage in fine fashion.


By beating Portugal, Georgia completed the biggest Euros upset in history, based on Fifa rankings, and created a night to remember in their debut major tournament. They will now play Spain in the last 16, while Portugal take on Slovenia.

Ghanas 200m athletes narrowly miss podium at African Seniors Athletics Championships,"Ghana's sprinters Abdul Rasheed Saminu and Mary Boakye narrowly missed out on podium finishes in the men's and women's 200m events at the African Seniors Athletics Championships on Wednesday.


Saminu, competing in the men's 200m, was initially placed third by the electronic timer with a time of 20.66 seconds. However, moments later, his position was reassigned to fourth place, as Cameroon's Emmanuel Eseme was awarded the bronze.


The discrepancy arose from a handwritten timer readjusting Saminu’s time to 20.67 seconds. 


This controversial decision ultimately denied the 23-year-old a bronze medal. The race was won by Liberia's Joseph Fambulleh, who finished in 20.25 seconds, with Zimbabwe's Tapiwanashe Makarawu taking silver in 20.51 seconds.


In the women's 200m final, Mary Boakye also finished fourth, clocking 23.40 seconds.




The event was won by Ivory Coast's Maca Gbai in 22.84 seconds. Gbai’s compatriot Maboundou Kone claimed silver with a time of 22.99 seconds, and Malawi's Asimenye Simwaka took bronze at 23.05 seconds.


In the field events, Ghana's Cadman Evans Yamoah, the reigning African Games men's high jump champion, struggled to replicate his past success.


Yamoah, a student at the University of Central Missouri, was unable to clear the bar at 2.10 meters, exiting in the first phase alongside his compatriot Kennedy Ocansey.


Morocco's Saad Hammouda, whom Yamoah had previously bested at the African Games, secured the gold medal with a jump of 2.15 meters.




Despite the setbacks, Ghana ended the competition with three medals, two gold and one bronze.

Malta Guinness holds capacity building workshop for Womens Premier League players,"Title sponsors of the Ghana Women's Premier League, Malta Guinness, organized a capacity-building workshop for selected players across all 20 top-flight clubs. 


Two players from each team were selected for the first edition of the workshop.


The event which took place at the Guinness Ghana Breweries premises at Achimota ABC junction on Wednesday, June 26, 2024, is part of the brand's plan to improve the communication levels of the players in terms of their public speaking as well as talk to them about their personal and social media branding.





The idea of the workshop was also to prepare the players for life after the end of their respective football careers. 


Former Black Queens player and head coach Mercy Tagoe-Quarcoo was one of the three personnel who spoke to the players on the day. 




She shared her experience of blending football and work and planning for her future after she retired from football. 


Speaking on the sidelines of the workshop, she told Joy Sports: ""I believe this is a very good program for these girls. During my time, we didn't get anything like this.""





""I think it's okay; life is about planning so if you bring such football players here like this to this place, I believe it will go a long way to let them understand that there is always life after football...get this opportunity is a step in the right direction."" 


Head of Public Relations and Strategy, Neil Armstrong-Mortagbe, also praised the initiative by Malta Guinness highlighting the importance of the workshop. 




""We spoke to [the players] about public speaking...they will be speaking to public so it was to break it to a level where they could understand that public speaking is not that difficult an act,"" he added. 





""It is an act that they need to grow their careers and also to promote the game of football and promote the interest of the sponsors of the Women's Premier League, in our particular case, the Malta Guinness.""


On her path, the Marketing Manager for the Adult Premium Non-Alcoholic drinks at Guinness Ghana, Dinah Adu-Asare, detailed the decision to come up with the capability-building workshop.


""We believe that there is life after football, we believe there is life beyond the pitch. As a brand, we thought about how we could invest in these women to prepare them for life after football,"" she said. 




""Today, we brought together resource people; some old players who are doing very well even after playing to come and encourage them, to share their stories with them and also direct them on how to make a better life after football.





""We also had a personal branding and social media expert to take them through their personal branding and to put themselves out there. I am very happy hearing the girls and seeing their visions and their ambitions.""


Malta Guinness Ghana has been the headline sponsor of the women's top flight in the last two seasons.


Hasaacas Ladies claimed the league title in the just-ended season after beating rivals Ampem Darkoa Ladies in the final at the University of Ghana.

Foden leaves England camp for birth of third child,"England midfielder Phil Foden has left the Three Lions' Euro 2024 camp in Germany and returned to the UK for the birth of his third child.


In a statement, the Football Association said the Manchester City player, 24, needed to go home because of a ""pressing family matter"".


It is hoped Foden will be back with the squad by Sunday, the day of England's last-16 match (17:00 BST).


In April, Foden and his partner Rebecca Cooke announced on Instagram they were expecting a third child.


They have two children. Son Ronnie, five, and daughter True, who is two years old.




Foden, who has 37 caps, started all three of England's group games at the tournament so far, including Tuesday's draw with Slovenia.


Gareth Southgate's side finished top of Group C with five points from three matches.


Their last-16 tie will take place in Gelsenkirchen, with their opponents to be confirmed after Wednesday's final group games.

Eric Alagidede: Nsoatremans GM on clubs FA Cup success and what lies ahead,"Nsoatreman FC marked a milestone last Sunday, winning the first major silverware of the club's young history after beating Brong Ahafo regional neighbours Tano Bofoakwa to be crowned Ghana's newest FA Cup kings.


The victory, a hard-fought one secured on penalties, complemented a fine sophomore Ghana Premier League (GPL) season that saw them finish fourth—a marked improvement on the previous campaign's 13th place.


Some would attribute that rise to the appointment of head coach Maxwell Konadu ahead of the season, and rightly so, but an arguably bigger factor in Nsoatreman's success was another pre-season recruit: Eric Alagidede, the 44-year-old who joined the club as General Manager (GM) around the same time as former national team coach Konadu's arrival.


It wasn't a role he had ever handled on such a scale, but Alagidede—who cites as an influence James Essilfie, former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Medeama—was not exactly a novice, having worked extensively in football administration prior to taking up Nsoatreman's job offer.





“I started off as CEO of Apata Kofi Soccer Academy in Winneba, going on to helm the affairs of Westland FC, a third-tier side which produced goalkeepers Richard Ofori (of Black Stars fame) and Yaw Ansah Fufuro (currently with Aduana FC),” he tells this writer in an exclusive interview. 




“GPL side Karela United were my next employers, and I served for four years as their Business Development & Communications manager before resigning in 2021 to become CEO of Koforidua Suhyen Sporting Club—a project started together with some partners—prior to my July 2023 move to Nsoatreman,” he continues.


Alagidede's new position entailed overseeing the day-to-day management of the club's operation on all fronts—including matters pertaining to the technical team, playing body, and activities of auxiliary staff—signing of player contracts and, well, so much more.


“About sixty percent of the success of a team depends on proper managerial skills,” Alagidede asserts, going on to detail how he goes the extra mile to ensure things are properly done.





“I do not limit myself to work that could be done behind an office desk, rather ensuring I am a regular presence at the training ground every other day so I have a fair idea of the players’ conduct, fitness, etc. 




“Even when the team is in camp preparing for home games, I go there at odd hours to monitor and observe happenings. That has helped me cultivate a personal relationship with the players which, in turn, facilitates my work and the team's functioning.”


The results, as pointed out at the outset, have been amazing. Actually, given what he set out to achieve in his first season, Alagidede's Nsoatreman have exceeded targets.


“In my inaugural speech,” he says, “I made it clear that I would want to secure the team's top-flight status for the 2024/25 season, and also change the narrative of Nsoatreman being the division's worst travellers.”





The latter was a sore point in a fairly decent debut campaign, with the team picking just a win and a draw away from their Nsoatre base.




Under Alagidede's guidance, however, that has been fixed in some style. In the 2023/24 season, no team won more games on the road than Nsoatreman's five, and only Asante Kotoko racked up more points in that column (19) than Nsoatreman (18).


To climax it all was, of course, the FA Cup triumph whose glow is still apparent on my interviewee's face.


Alagidede rates the season just gone as merely “successful”, modestly, and refuses to take all the praise for it.





“None of this would have been possible without a well-motivated squad made up of a blend of experienced players and eager youngsters, a brilliant gaffer who maximised the resources at his disposal, and a very capable and supportive Board,” Alagidede rolls out the credits.




It has not been all plain-sailing, though, he is keen to point out.


Managing a Ghanaian club, especially one still quite new to the harsh realities of challenging at the highest level, is fraught with difficulties, and Alagidede emphasises how easy it is not for “most young teams or newly-promoted clubs—like Nsoatreman—to compete favourably with the Kotokos and Accra Hearts of Oaks for quality players due to the sheer financial muscle required to do so”.


Having qualified for next season's CAF Confederation Cup (by virtue of winning the FA Cup), though, Nsoatreman would have to pull out all the stops to get the best players they can—during a period when traditional heavyweights Kotoko and Hearts are also looking to significantly upgrade their respective playing bodies—so their maiden continental campaign proves a truly memorable one.





“We are already in the market for some experienced players both locally and within the sub-region as well as other parts of Africa to beef up the squad,” Alagidede reveals, adding that Nsoatreman “understands the pressure that comes with playing in Africa.”




That pressure has certainly been ramped up by fellow GPL side Dreams FC's impressive run to the Confederation Cup's semi-finals last term, but Alagidede insists that sterling example is anything but daunting, only an encouragement that “anything is possible with proper planning”.


And while making a mark in Africa is the immediate goal, Alagidede is clear about what legacy he hopes to create at Nsoatreman in the long term.


“I intend to set up a structure that will bring financial benefits to the investors and instil a winning mentality in the club,” he concludes.


He has, without a doubt, got that mission off to a blistering start.

Ken Bediako: Ghana and the Seoul 1988 Olympic Games,"This was the first “full scale,” Olympics since the past three boycott prone Olympiads of Montreal 1976, Moscow 1980 and Angeles 1984. A record 159 countries were in the South Korean capital for the biggest sports festival on the planet.


Ghana entered three disciplines, boxing, athletics and table tennis. Even though a couple of the boxers and athletes showed much improvement their performances were not good enough to win any medals.


The four-man boxing squad of flyweight Alfred Kotey, lightweight Ike Quartey, Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah (captain) and Lightmiddleweight


Emmanuel Quaye. All the boxers had an early boost when all of them luckily drew a bye in the first round.


Alfred Ankamah inspired his colleagues with one of the fastest knockouts in the tournament when he stopped Jay Smbeye of Malawi in 1 min 15 secs in the first round. A terrific right caught the Malawian flush on the jaw and he dropped heavily on his back to be counted out.




Flyweight Alfred Kotey followed suit with another first round win for Ghana over Husain Almuntari of Kuwait. The referee stepped in at 2mins 43secs to save the clearly outclassed Kuwaiti from undue punishment.


Lightweight Ike Quartey also won with unanimous decision over Saizozena of Dominican Republic. Ike did well but his stamina appeared suspect in the closing stages of the fight.
















Lightmiddleweight Emmanuel Quaye, lost to Lauren’s Mercando of Equador. Quaye was just too inexperienced and not even the fact that his opponent was given a public warning in the second round for persistently hitting with open gloves, could make any difference. Quaye was given a standing count as round three began and it was obvious that he couldn’t last. It was not surprising therefore when he was decked just before the end of the round to be counted out.


In his second fight, Flyweight Alfred Kotey produced a blistering double fisted attack to score a unanimous points victory against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath. He dominated the Tanzanian in the first two rounds but the Tanzanian came out strongly in the third round. In hot exchanges late in the round, the Tanzanian opened a cut on the left cheek of Kotey but Kotey had done enough to get the verdict.




Lightweight Ike Quartey lost his second fight to Australia’s Grabane Chevey in a close contest. The first round was even and Ike won the second round. The third was also quite close but when the scores were called, the Australian had been made winner by all the five officials. Most Journalists were of the opinion that, perhaps the aggressive brawling tactics of the Australian might have bamboozled the judges. Ike Quartey obviously felt cheated and he dramatically staged a mini protest by refusing to leave the ring for a couple of minutes. He eventually left after bowing out amidst applause from the crowd.


Lightwelterweight Alfred Ankamah also lost his second fight against American Kenneth Gould. The American, stronger and much more muscular, was the better boxer Right from round one, he established his superiority proving too elusive for Ankamah to catch with any of his usual bombs. Ankamah was however courageous and determined to fight but he never really found an antidote to Gould’s tactics. The unanimous verdict was never in dispute.


The biggest setback to the boxing team was when medal hopeful Alfred Kotey was declared unfit at the ringside moments before his quarter final bout against Mexican Gonzales. The medical commission of AIBA (International Amateur Boxing Association) ruled that a cut which Kotey had sustained in the previous fight against Tanzanian Benjamin Mwangath and which had been stitched, was unsafe for the Ghanaian to fight. All attempts by the Ghanaian officials to have the ruling reversed failed. Team physician Dr Forjour was particularly a sad person for sanctioning the stitching of Kotey’s cut.


In athletics, sprinter Leo Myles Mills emerged the most outstanding Ghanaian athlete. He won both the first and second round heats in the 100 metres in 10.33 secs and 10.12 secs to reach the semi-finals.




Team officials believed that the draw of lanes in the semis which put Myles Mills next to the indomitable Carl Lewis of the US, would inspire him. Instead he appeared overawed and tensed up and was surprisingly left behind on the starting blocks as the gun went. In the event Myles Mills finished last in the semis with a time of 10.43 secs having clocked 10 33 secs and 10.21 secs earlier in the heats.


Again in the 200 metres Myles Mills qualified for the second round heats by placing 4th behind Italy’s Stefano Tolli, Carl Lewis and Nigeria’s Olapide Adenikan in 21.04 secs. Then in the quarter finals he finished 6th but didn’t qualify for the semi-finals because his time of 20.95 secs was a shade slower than Belgium’s Patrick Stephens. 


The men’s 100×4 relay quartet of Eric Akogyeram, Nelson Boateng, Salam Gariba and Myles Mills qualified for the semis finishing third behind the Soviet Union and West Germany in 39.13 secs, the 6th fastest of the 14 qualifiers.


The Ghanaians were hopeful of a medal following the disqualification of the strong US team for changing the last baton in the wrong zone whilst winning their first round heats. Poor baton changing however cost Ghana and the team placed fifth in the semis in 39. 46 secs earning an overall 12th position in the rankings. All the first eight clocked under 39 secs.




Triple jumper Francis Dodoo failed to make it to the second round. He managed a poor 16.88 metres after four attempts and thus failed to qualify for the second round.


In the women’s division top star Diana Yankey didn’t have much of a chance in the sprints. Running against the likes of super star Florence Griffiths Joyner the Olympic and world record holder and Evelyn Ashford both of the US. However, she managed to qualify for the second heats where she was eliminated by placing last in 11.64 secs. Also in the women’s 100m metres hurdles Diana Yankey failed to qualify for the second round when she placed 4th in her heats. Her time of 13. 64 secs put her in the 24th ranking out of 33 starters and was not good enough for her to advance.


In the women’s long jump, 16-year-old US-based student Juliana Yendork finished 27th among 29 competitors.


She fell at the end of the first round but one expected Yendork gaining inspiration having compelled against top class athletes like Olympic record holder Jackie Joyner Kersey.




The women’s sprints relay quartet of Veronica Bawuah, Diana Yankey, Mercy Addy and Marha Appiah crashed out in the semis after running the 13th fastest time of 44.12 secs in the quarter finals.


In table tennis young Patricia Akosua Ofei lost all her four matches to place 6th and last in her group Patricia lost 3-1 to Australian Kerry Tapier 21-19, 21-12, 20-22, 21-16. Lost 3-1 to Wai Cheng Lau of Malaysia,18-21, 21-18, 21-17, 21-17 beaten 3-1 by Ka Sha Kok of Hong Kong 21-18, 18-21, 21-17, 21-17 and then 3-0 to Kiyomib Ishida of Japan 20-22,16-21,15-21.


For young Akos, the experience gained by facing top class opposition from China, Malaysia and Japan proved invaluable. She rose to become a national star.

Phil Foden leaves Englands Euro 2024 camp to return to UK,"Phil Foden has left England’s European Championship camp due to a “pressing family matter”, the FA announced on Wednesday.


No details were given, but the Manchester City player’s departure was described as “temporary”.


It raises the possibility that Foden could return to Germany in time for England’s round-of-16 match in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday.


This is not the first time an England player has left a recent tournament camp due to a family matter.


Chelsea forward Raheem Sterling flew home from the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 following a break-in at his home. He returned in time for the quarter-final against France and came on as a second-half substitute.




Foden has started all three of England’s games in Germany to date and was supported by family members during the 0-0 draw with Slovenia in Cologne on Tuesday.


The 24-year-old has started all three group matches for Gareth Southgate’s side on the left-side of an attacking midfield three, behind central striker Harry Kane.


Foden clinched the player of the year awards from the Football Writers’ Association (FWA) for the 2023-2024 season, securing 42 per cent of the votes after helping City to win their fourth successive Premier League title.


Foden has been capped 37 times by England, scoring four goals.

Asante Kotoko coach undergoes successful surgery,"Prosper Narteh Ogum has successfully undergone a surgery following a brief illness, Asante Kotoko has announced on Wednesday.


Although the club did not specify the nature of the illness that required the surgery, they confirmed that the procedure was successful.


Ogum is now focusing on regaining full fitness ahead of the next season.



""Our head coach, Dr. Prosper Narteh Ogum has undergone a successful surgery after a short illness. We wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to having him back soon"".GET WELL SOON, Coach!"" the club wrote on social media.



Ogum, who is also part of the club’s Interim Management Committee, is spearheading the restructuring of the playing squad.




The club has released 19 players, including goalkeeper Ibrahim Danlad and striker Steven Mukwala, following the conclusion of the 2023/24 Ghana Premier League season.


“We need to implement several structural changes in the playing body with regard to signing players to strengthen the squad. This time, we are targeting players who have experience in the Premier League, not just those from lower divisions,” the 46-year-old said in a recent interview with the club’s media.


“We need to act swiftly to ensure we secure the players we want as quickly as possible,” he added.


Kotoko finished last season without a trophy, placing sixth in the Ghana Premier League.




Prosper Narteh Ogum is expected to recover in time to lead the team for their upcoming Democracy Cup game against Hearts of Oak next month.

African Games 2023: Every cedi will be accounted for  Sports Minister assures Ghanaians,"The Sports Minister, Mustapha Ussif, has assured Ghanaians that his office will account for every amount spent during the 2023 African Games.


Ghana hosted the 13th edition of the continental competition back in March with the University of Ghana Stadium and Borteyman Sports Complex being the main centres for the games. 


Ussif appeared before Parliament on Tuesday, June 25, to report on the aftermath of the games but his report did not capture the financial account of the competition.


The Minister explained the expenditure for the games was not included in the report because a question had been filed for him to appear before the house and account for it.


""We are not hiding anything. I want that clarity to be made. Every cedi is going to be accounted for. Be rest assured,"" he said. 




""Rather you should congratulate team Ghana because so far we have not seen the Minority issue any statement in congratulating the sportsmen and women who fought very hard in lifting the flag of the country very high.""


At the end of the games, Ghana amassed 69 medals overall, the country's most medal haul in the 59-year history of the competition.

African Games 2023: Minority clashes with Majority in Parliament over competition expenditure,"Ghana’s Parliament witnessed a heated disagreement between the Minority and Majority groups on Tuesday, June 25, over the expenditure for the 2023 African Games held in Ghana.


The Sports Minister, Mustapha Ussif, presented a report to the House about the continental event, which took place from March 8-23, 2024.


However, the report did not include details about the amount spent.


The Minority in Parliament, led by Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, criticized Ussif and demanded full details on the expenditure.


Dr Forson said: “We know for sure $15 million was allocated to a company called M and L Company Limited for 18 days of feeding, that amounts to 226 million cedis for 18 days.




“You cannot come here and deliver a statement without accounting for $15 million for 18 days. This is public money.”


Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa also quizzed: ""There is no mention of how much this country has spent on the games. What is honourable minister concealing from this house? What is he hiding?.""


In response, Majority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin said the Minority’s priorities are misplaced.


“Instead of commending the Minister for a good job done, you want to use the opportunity to critique and say things that are not factual.”




Former Majority Leader Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu defended the Sports Minister, arguing that adequate time is needed to account for the expenditure. 


“You cannot say that within two weeks or three weeks, the Minister should be able to come before this house and explain everything. The Minority Leader, fortunately, is an accountant and he understands these things.”


Ghana won 69 medals at the competition, which was hosted on home soil for the first time in the country’s history.

Consistent 4th place finishes affected me mentally  Ta Lou,"Ivorian sprint star Marie-Joseè Ta Lou has opened up about the mental challenges she faced after repeatedly finishing just shy of the podium in the World Championships and Olympic Games.


The 34-year-old finished fourth in the 2016 Olympics, 0.007s out of the podium, and she reflects on how these near-misses have affected her mindset and her approach to the sport.


""I was mentally disappointed by many poor results, especially finishing 4th each time,"" Ta Lou revealed as quoted by satelliteinfos.net. 


""It affected me a lot. If I came back again it’s because I have a strong mind.""


Ta Lou's career has been marked by numerous close calls, where she found herself narrowly missing out on a medal including the last championships in Budapest.




These fourth-place finishes, while demonstrating her elite capabilities, have also been a source of frustration and mental strain.


Despite these setbacks, the Ivorian remains resolute in her commitment to give her best performance at the upcoming Olympics.


""This time, I do not want to make any promise to the Ivorians. I will do my best at the Olympics,"" she said.


At 35, she acknowledges the possibility that these could be her last Olympic Games. ""You have to know how to leave,"" she noted. ""But if God gives me the strength I will still be here.""

I withdrew from Douala Athletics Championships due to poor organisation   Marie-Josee Ta Lou,"African Athletics Seniors Championships double winner, Marie-Joseè Ta Lou, says her decision to withdraw from the 2024 African Athletics Seniors Championships in Douala is due to poor organisation.


The Ivorian sprint queen withdrew from the competition after Day 1, citing concerns about the event's organisation, which she described as substandard and risky for athletes.


""This is for security reasons. I did this because the start of the competition wasn't too great,"" Ta Lou explained as quoted by satelliteinfos.net.


""I can't come and run and stay there without knowing the results on site and even the next step. I didn't like it at all. The conditions from the start of the competition were not pleasant for me.


""I wanted to stop because I hurt myself a little. Since the Olympic Games are already on the horizon, I preferred to stop to avoid big risks.""




Ta Lou, known for her consistent presence and performance in African athletics, emphasised the need for improved conditions.


""We don't talk for the sake of talking but for things to change. Not just for us. We could have not come and stayed in our corners. 


""But we decided to come and promote African sport because it is our competition. And that's what I've always done.""


Addressing the withdrawal of other athletes, Ta Lou said, ""I'm 35 years old and I take responsibility for what I do.




""Since last Wednesday as you noticed, I have not complained but if I did, it is because I just wanted to attract the attention of the leaders. Not with any intention of harm.


""The African championships are our competition as Africans. I am not asking that we be in American or European conditions either, I am aware of our realities.


""As proof, I always attended the African Championships. In 2018, 2016, 2012 and 2014, it was only the 2022 championships that I was unable to do because I had changed coaches and a shoulder problem. I am still happy because the conditions have improved.""


Ta Lou, Nigeria sprinter Favour Ofili, and 2023 World Athletics Championships silver medalist, Letsile Tebogo had all threatened to pull out over what many described as a chaotic organisation of the event.

Injured Murray not made decision on Wimbledon farewell,"Andy Murray has not made a decision on whether he will be fit enough to make a planned Wimbledon farewell next week.


The 37-year-old Briton had a procedure on a back issue at the weekend.


Murray is set to retire later this year and hopes for a final appearance at Wimbledon, where he won two of his three Grand Slam titles.


""Following his surgery on Saturday, Andy is continuing to work with his medical team to confirm when he will return to the court,"" Murray's team said in a statement.


""At this stage, no decisions have been made and we will update further as soon as anything has been finalised.""




Wimbledon, where Murray became the first British men's singles champion in 77 years when he won in 2013, begins on 1 July.


A report in the Telegraph, external on Sunday said Murray would not be able to compete after having surgery on a spinal cyst.


Murray would not confirm the nature of the procedure when asked by BBC Sport.


Before his back issue flared up at Queen's last week, the Scot had intended to play in the singles and doubles - alongside his brother Jamie - at the All England Club.




Murray has also been selected for Great Britain at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.


The tennis event starts on 27 July on the clay courts at Roland Garros.


Murray, also a two-time Olympic gold medallist, said earlier in June that retiring at Wimbledon or the Olympics would be ""fitting"", given his success in both events.


He had previously said he was ""not planning to play much beyond the summer"" but did not confirm what would be his final tournament.




Andy Murray was the first British men's singles champion in 77 years when he won Wimbledon in 2013


Why Wimbledon means so much to Murray


Wimbledon has been the scene of some of Murray's greatest moments on the court.


Weeks after the emotional defeat by Roger Federer in the 2012 final, and the teary post-match interview that changed public opinion of him, Murray returned to win Olympic gold on Centre Court against the same opponent.


That triumph set the platform for Murray to end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's Wimbledon champion in 2013, with victory over world number one Novak Djokovic.


In 2016, he became Wimbledon champion for a second time, beating Milos Raonic in what would ultimately become the best year of his career - ending up as the world number one for the first time.




So it is little surprise Murray wants to give himself as much time as possible to make what is expected to be a fond farewell on Centre Court.


With the main draw for the men's singles taking place at 10am on Friday, it appears Murray is giving himself the rest of the week to see how he responds to the surgery before making a decision.


How Murray ended up in latest fitness battle


Murray, who thought in 2019 he would have to retire because of a hip injury, knows there is no perfect ending to a tennis career.


But it would feel cruel if the best British player of his generation is not able to say goodbye on home turf as planned - fully fit and perhaps with one last hurrah.




Rupturing ankle ligaments at the Miami Open in March - shortly after Murray said he did not intend to play much past the summer and just as he began to show signs of resurgent form - was a big blow.


After returning on the clay seven weeks later, he started struggling with a problem on the left side of his back, where he had surgery in 2013, and said he has ""degenerative"" issues.


At Queen's, where he had to stop playing after five games of his second-round match against Australia's Jordan Thompson, Murray said he suffered ""nerve-type discomfort"" on the right side.


Murray said it caused a ""loss of strength, coordination and control"" in his right leg.




""I hadn't experienced that before,"" he added.

Euro 2024: England top Group C despite draw with Slovenia,"England moved into Euro 2024’s last 16 at the top of Group C - but it was only achieved after another drab display with a draw against Slovenia in Cologne.


Gareth Southgate’s side offered up slightly more than in the abysmal performance against Denmark but once again it was nowhere good enough to justify England’s status as pre-tournament favourites.


England were laboured and only showed quality in flashes, namely in the first half when a slick passing moved ended with Bukayo Saka’s goal being ruled out for offside and once again felt the full fury of their fans at the final whistle.


Conor Gallagher failed to justify his inclusion and was replaced at half-time, with the introduction of Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo providing more urgency after the break.


England were also short on creativity in a group where no team scored more than one goal in a game for the first time in the competition’s history.




Denmark's 0-0 draw with Serbia means they finish second and Slovenia qualify as one of the best third-placed teams.


It was a good night in other respects for England, with results elsewhere meaning the dangerous quartet of France, Spain, Germany and Portugal have dropped into the other side of the draw.


England's last 16 opponents are currently the Netherlands - but that could change after the final round of matches.

Euro 2024: Serbia knocked out as Denmark go through with draw,"Serbia failed to put up a fight as they were knocked out of Euro 2024 following a draw which saw Denmark progress.


Neither side produced a performance that reflected their potential, but Denmark were the better team in a forgettable encounter in Munich.


Jonas Wind had a goal disallowed for Denmark in the first half because the ball had gone out of play before he bundled it over the line from a corner.


The Wolfsburg forward also slipped as he tried to connect with a smart flick-on from Rasmus Hojlund, slicing over the bar from a good position, and was substituted at the break.


Denmark continued to create chances despite a poor display by their standards. Alexander Bah headed wide and Christian Eriksen's shot had to be parried behind for a corner.




Serbia, who knew they would be eliminated if they did not win because of Slovenia's stalemate with England in the other Group C match, had just one shot on target that came in second-half stoppage time.


They did have a goal ruled out when Luka Jovic's shot bounced in off Denmark defender Joachim Anderson in the second half - but the striker was offside in the build-up.


Knowing their place in the last 16 was secure with a draw, a pragmatic Denmark side lacked ruthlessness. Although Jannik Vestergaard headed a corner delivery at Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic, they rarely tested him throughout the second half.

Euro 2024: Austria stun the Netherlands to progress to last 16,"Austria produced a hugely impressive performance that will make others take notice at Euro 2024 as they beat the Netherlands to progress to the last 16 as Group D winners.


Despite being handed a tough draw with the Dutch and France, Ralf Rangnick’s side won two of their three games to finish top of the standings.


The Netherlands had already guaranteed their progression to the last 16 but they will now go through as one of the best third-placed sides, with France second.


This was a fully deserved win for Austria as they played with spirit and desire throughout, and showed great determination to respond to a fast start to the second-half by the Netherlands as Marcel Sabitzer's strike secured the victory.


The Austrians had been gifted a sixth-minute lead when Donyell Malen turned home Alexander Prass’s dangerous cross.




And, although Malen had a chance at redemption but scuffed his shot, Austria took control as the Netherlands struggled to get a touch of the ball at times.


Rangnick’s side had chances to add to their lead through Sabitzer and Marko Arnautovic, but the Netherlands were level just 75 seconds into the second half.


The Dutch came out fighting in the second half and equalised when Cody Gakpo curled in a great finish.


That prompted a shift in tempo and Austria were holding on as Virgil van Dijk’s header deflected over the bar.




But Austria weathered the storm and retook the lead through Romano Schmid’s powerful header, which the unfortunate Stefan de Vrij could only help over the line.


Memphis Depay thought he had earned the Dutch a draw when his close-range volley survived a check for handball by the video assistant referee, but Sabitzer had the final say when he broke through and drove into the roof of the net to send the Austrian fans wild.

Euro 2024: Mbappe hits first Euros goal but France finish second in group,"A masked Kylian Mbappe scored his first-ever Euros goal but France were held to a draw by an already-eliminated Poland to finish second in Group D.


France needed all three points in order to seal top spot, but Robert Lewandowski's 79th-minute penalty cancelled out Mbappe’s spot-kick 11 minutes into the second half.


Ralf Rangnick's Austria produced a fantastic display to beat the Netherlands 3-2 and top the group, while the Dutch took third place.


The runner-up in Group E awaits Didier Deschamps' side, who now occupy the same half of the draw as Portugal, Spain and Germany.


Having returned to the starting line-up following a broken nose and donning a protective mask, Mbappe ended his wait for a first goal at a European Championships with the opener.




Ousmane Dembele was brought down in the area by Poland and Arsenal defender Jakub Kiwior and Mbappe made no mistake from the spot.


But France took their foot off the gas and a clumsy challenge from Dayot Upamecano gifted Lewandowski a golden opportunity to respond with a spot-kick of his own.


Mike Maignan thought he was the French hero after saving Lewandowski's effort but the goalkeeper had encroached off his line and the penalty had to be retaken.


The Poland captain slotted into the corner to score for a fourth European Championships, joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric in achieving the feat.

Kotoko to terminate Richmond Lampteys contract,"Ghana Premier League side Asante Kotoko and midfielder Richmond Lamptey have reached a mutual agreement to part ways.


The imminent termination of his deal comes following a disappointing end to the 2023/24 season and on the back of the club’s massive clearance.


The midfielder, who has two months left on his deal at the club, will now leave as a free agent and the freedom to join a club of his choice.


He is set to become the 20th player to depart the club after the season with the club already letting go off 19 players.


The Porcupine Warriors released 18 players last week as they begin plans for a fresh start ahead of next season.




On Monday, the club also announced the departure of Steven Mukwala who is reportedly said to be on a move to Tanzania.


Other notable players to have been released include Danlad Ibrahim and Isaac Oppong who were both instrumental for Prosper Narteh Ogum when the club won the league at the end of the 2021/22 season.


Lamptey joined Kotoko from Inter Allies in September 2021 and helped them to Premier League triumph in his first season.


The midfielder was part of the Black Stars squad at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Côte d’Ivoire.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.
