"I used to be followed by 6 policemen, 8 soldiers, and 15 bodyguards but no more  Obinim","The head pastor of the International Gods Way Church, Bishop Daniel Obinim, has lamented about the privileges he used to enjoy some time ago as a pastor.

He disclosed that his security personnel previously encompassed six (6) policemen, eight (8) soldiers and fifteen (15) bodyguards who were following him wherever he went to protect him. 

Obinim said that the situation is different currently as he is escorted by his pastor or walks alone when he is embarking on a trip to other places. 

Speaking in a TikTok live session monitored by GhanaWeb, Bishop Daniel Obinim advised the general public to be careful with their lives especially when they are thriving and making money. 

""People are saying they like the current Obinim. Brother, what I have gone through in life, that I am not in the limelight anymore, is a lot. Right now, when I am walking, no one follows me. There is no soldier or bodyguard apart from my driver, Pastor Raymond.

""Previously, I was followed by 6 policemen, 8 soldiers, national security, Bureau of National Investigations (BNI) officials, and 15 bodyguards, but today, where are they? No more. I walk alone or with my pastor,"" he said.

It is not known why Obinim would make such claims; however, he is not as loud in the public domain as he used to be some time ago.

Man commits suicide after reportedly losing N2.5 million online bet,"A 31-year-old man has committed suicide in Abia State, Nigerias South-east, after reportedly losing N2.5 million in an online bet.

The deceased, Chukwuma Onoh, was said to have borrowed N1.2 million from friends which he combined with his N1.3 million to place a bet but failed to win it.

Mr Onoh had, earlier on the same day in a WhatsApp message, pleaded with a man said to be his boss to help him clear a debt of N1.2 million which he incurred after losing the N2.5 million bet.

The only option is to end my life as I cannot live with the shame. I have turned into a gambler because of no job, and right now, I am at a point if I dont redeem my debt, I might kill myself to pay the debt, he reportedly wrote in a viral WhatsApp message.

A screenshot of the victims WhatsApp chat with the man has been circulating on social media.

I used N2,500,000 to place a bet and N1.2 m is not my own and if I dont pay up today. I will be dead by the time you read this message. As I type this message, I am where I want to buy a sniper, he added.

The man told Mr Onoh that he was out of cash to help at the moment and that the victim should ask his creditors to hold on so he (the victim) could clear the debts based on instalment payments.

How it started

On Tuesday, Mr Onoh dropped a suicide note on his Facebook page which prompted some of his friends to reach out to him.

Today is my last day on earth! I (am) going to meet my maker, he wrote without giving a reason.

The victim thanked some of his associates and friends.

My spirit is with you all, he told them.

Mr Onoh, who hailed from Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, was said to have taken the sniper less than two hours after making the post on his Facebook page.

He was later rushed to Madonna Hospital Umuahia by friends but was declared dead by the doctors on duty.

Heartbroken

One of his friends, Chisom Ibeako, confirmed the development to PREMIUM TIMES on Wednesday morning.

Ms Ibeako said she was heartbroken watching the victim die at the hospital despite efforts by doctors and nurses to resuscitate him.

She expressed surprise that the victim would take his own life despite often helping to mobilise funds for various persons in difficulty, regretting that she did not see the victims Facebook post on time.

Some of his friends who saw his post first thought it was a joke until he did a live video. But as at the time, he has already taken the sniper, she said.

Ms Ibeako said the victim was not opening up to his friends and based on her interactions with the late Onohs sisters at the hospital, the victim did not also open up to his family members.

She said although the victim was a university graduate, he was not engaged in any known job.

Sniper, a highly toxic pesticide, has lately been used by some Nigerians to commit suicide.

When contacted on Wednesday morning, the police spokesperson in Abia State, Maureen Chinaka, said she was attending a conference outside the state and would not be able to comment on the incident at the moment.

I will get back to you later, said Ms Chinaka, an assistant superintendent of police.

Outrage

Meanwhile, Nigerians have expressed outrage on social media over the incident.

While many condemned the victim for taking his life on the basis of losing a bet, others expressed anger that his friends did not notice he was going through financial difficulty.

A Facebook user, Onyebuchi Ezeleonu, accused the victim of being driven by greed.

Whatever that had made you take this path, doesnt worth it. You allowed the pressure of the world and that of fake life to overwhelm you, Mr Ezeleonu wrote.

Abuchi Obika, another Facebook user, expressed anger that the victims friends did not notice that he was in trouble before now.

Those who are talking trash claimed to be closer to him, yet dont know what he was passing through, he stated.

'Youre jealous of Prophet Adom Kyei-Duahs crowd' - Kumchacha fires Evangelist Kwasi Awuah,"The founder of Heavens Gate Ministries, Nicholas Osei popularly known as Kumchacha has slammed Evangelist Kwasi Awuah over his incessant attacks on Prophet Stephen Adom Kyei-Duah. 

He bemoaned why Evangelist Kwasi Awuah would be obsessed with his colleague pastors church activities and chide him consistently as a man of God. 

The clergyman asserted that Evangelist Kwasi Awuahs criticisms of Prophet Adom Kyei-Duah are because he is envious of the number of people who attend his church and not his doctrines as he claims. 

Kumchacha called on Evangelist Kwasi Awuah to halt his attacks on Prophet Adom Kyei-Duah because it is a hypocritical attitude. 

If you look at the crowd the man [Prophet Adom Kyei-Duah] has in his church, he [Kwasi Awuah] is jealous thats why he is tarnishing his image so that the people would go to his church. Some pastors claim that some of their colleagues are not from God, those saying that, are they from God? Among the two pastors, the more beneficial one is Prophet Adom Kyei-Duah because of his contribution to the widows and orphans in the country. 

When was the last time Kwasi Awuah donated to the needy? Even the pastors who follow him are struggling to make ends meet because he is a miser. So, in what way has Prophet Adom Kyei-Duah wronged him for Kwasi Awuah to attack him 24/7? When God was calling him, he wasnt there so he should stop that hypocrisy, he fumed. 

Evangelist Kwasi Awuah recently launched an attack on Prophet Stephen Adom Kyei-Duah by labelling his teachings as Nonsense after he claimed everyone would die on the day they were born.

Bride weeps uncontrollably as her ex-lover storms wedding to disrupt proceedings,"A viral video captures a a bride sobbing uncontrollably at her wedding.

Several efforts by patrons to console her, proved futile as she was spotted heartbroken after her ex disrupted her wedding.

Reports state that a man who claimed to be the brides 'baby daddy' stormed the venue unannounced to cause mayhem.

The father of the bride's child appeared to be upset that the wedding was taking place without his consent, a situation that caused him to react.

The development which was said to have happened in Ivory Coast, has since stirred massive discussions on social media.

The caption of the video spotted on a popular blog read, The father of her child arrived to ruin the wedding because she was with him the day before.

While some netizens believe that it was staged, others have condemned the development, particularly the conduct from both parties.",,Tabloid, 30 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Bride-weeps-uncontrollably-as-her-ex-lover-storms-wedding-to-disrupt-proceedings-1890311
Have you seen me smoking before? - Rev. Obofour fights  Akwasi Awuah over weed claims,"Rev.  Obofour Dare, the founder of Anointed Palace Chapel (APC) worldwide, has responded to claims by Evangelist Akwasi Awuah stating that he smokes weed despite being a pastor. 

According to him, the claims by Evangelist Akwasi Awuah about him smoking weed are false and should be disregarded by the general public. 

The founder of APC Worldwide questioned how Evangelist Akwasi Awuah knew he was a weed smoker without seeing him in the act or staying in the same residence with him. 

Rev. Obofour disclosed that Evangelist Akwasi Awuah's claims are meant to gain fame and public attention to convince people to join his church due to the decline in his popularity. 

My uncle who smoked went mad when I was a child and the same thing happened to my colleague in school. So I see weed as madness. Because Akwasi Awuah wants clout, fame, and more people to go to his church, he came to tell Ghanaians that he had seen me smoking weed in a car.

""When I talked about his wifes issue he was pained. As an Evangelist who has not seen it, he is spewing lies to tarnish my image for fame, he said in a video shared by Express GHTV on their YouTube channel. 

 He continued: So the people around could tell others that Obofour smokes weed even though he has not seen it. Have you seen someone smoking weed at the roadside before?  

""Does Akwasi Awuah stay in my house? So how did he know? Some people have allowed their pastors to tune their minds like a remote and they believe anything the person says, said Rev. Obofour.

 

His reaction comes after he got to know that Evangelist Akwasi Awuah marred his image by telling his congregants and the general public that he smokes weed. 

The comment did not sit well with Rev. Obofour who has come out to respond to the allegations and rebuffed the claims.

"You are complaining there is hardship in Ghana, what should Somalians do? - Rev. Obofour fires","The founder and leader of Anointed Palace Chapel (APC) worldwide and the CEO of Sweet TV, Rev. Obofour has admonished Ghanaians to lessen the rate at which they ponder over problems bedeviling them in their lives. 

He entreated members of the public not to spend a lot of time thinking about their problems because the predicament they are grappling with is better than other countries like Somalia if we are to compare the economic situations in both jurisdictions.

The man of God claimed that the current state of Ghana is better than Libya, a country where people used to seek refuge hence Ghanaians should not allow problems to overshadow their lives. 

In a video shared by Amazing TV on their YouTube channel and sighted by GhanaWeb, Rev. Obofour, who was preaching to his congregants advised them to focus on the positives and desist from consistently fretting over their challenges. 

While you have locked yourself in a room and weeping over your burden, someone with the same problem is at the beach enjoying. If you dont get rid of the distress it will remain forever. No matter the situation, someones problem is worse than yours. You are claiming there is hardship in Ghana, so what should Somalians do? he quizzed. 

Rev. Obofour further advised, Libya used to be a place of refuge but today Ghana is better than them. So always let happiness exceed sadness. Tragedy is darkness but you have to let me know that it will not overshadow or overcome you. So you have to be serious and stop being sad all the time. The ball is in your court. 

It is not known what triggered Rev. Obofours advice but it comes at a time when the country is struggling with the economic crisis.

Why I destroyed my husband's manhood - Woman tells it all,"Angela, a woman who has been in an amorous relationship with another man while still married, has disclosed that she destroyed her husbands manhood with the help of her boyfriend so she could leave the marriage.

Speaking with Arnold Elavanyo, she disclosed that to leave the marriage, she needed to make her husband impotent and blame it all on him.

I needed to find a way to escape. I didn't want to be the problem but to push all the problems on him (husband). I discussed it with my boyfriend. I needed to discuss it with someone, not family.

So, I discussed it with my boyfriend and we agreed to kill his manhood so I would blame the problem on his manhood not working so, I am not blamed for denying him sex and to avoid family, pastors and counsellors coming in. For this reason, the manhood needed to go, she disclosed.

When asked if she ever thought of having another child with her husband, she admitted that she never wanted to have any more children with him because there was nothing more to their relationship than friendship.

According to Angela, if she would have a child again, it would be with the man she loves.

I don't love the man, why will I have his child? The first one is enough. If I want more children, I should be with someone I love. I have been with my boyfriend for three years. Sometimes my boyfriend comes to my place but most of the time I go to his place.

We are in love else we wouldn't have come this far. My boyfriend took me somewhere and I was given a concoction to put in his drink and after that, his manhood went off, she said.

Woman shares harrowing tale of developing features of an antelope after eating forbidden meat,"In a shocking and bewildering account on Kasapa tiktok page, a woman has recounted her extraordinary ordeal of seemingly transforming into an antelope after consuming a type of meat that had been strictly forbidden by her mother. 

The chilling story unfolds with a series of inexplicable events that left her in agony and questioning her very existence.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, disclosed, ""When I was with my mum, she would often caution me against consuming a particular type of animal meat, warning me that it could lead to my demise. Though I was unsure about the identity of this forbidden meat, I would always nod in agreement.""

However, fate took a peculiar turn when she found herself residing with a restaurant owner renowned for selling exotic bush meat. 

Eager to heed her mother's advice, she confided in the restaurant operator, explaining that her mother had warned her not to consume a certain meat, fearing dire consequences. 

With curiosity piqued, she inquired, ""Which meat is it?"" The woman's response sent shivers down her spine: ""It's antelope meat.""

she continued, ""One day, the woman served me a meal that included the very meat I had been forbidden to eat. After devouring the dish, she provocatively asked if I had perished from consuming the forbidden meat. To my horror, she revealed that it was indeed the same meat I had been warned against.""



The nightmare began unfolding soon after as the woman started experiencing excruciating pain and discomfort around her wisdom teeth, prompting her to seek help from her mother.

 Upon reaching her father's hometown, she was met with alarming comments from the community as many remarked that her face bore an uncanny resemblance to that of an antelope.

""It reached a point where my mouth began to contort, and I was plagued by persistent bleeding,"" she lamented.

Desperate for answers and a cure, she turned to her paternal grandfather, who offered an explanation that sent shivers down her spine. ""He told me that had I intentionally consumed the antelope meat, I would have perished. However, because it was unintentional, I would be marked by this transformation,"" she revealed.

In a bizarre twist, she was instructed to lick her uncle's feet as a form of healing, a painful and unusual ritual she undertook in her desperate struggle to alleviate the relentless suffering.

 Ultimately, all her lower right teeth had to be removed to address the agonizing symptoms that had manifested as a result of her consumption of the forbidden meat.

She has however concluded her surgery to reform her teeth.

My husband is not the biological father of our first child  Woman confesses,"A married woman (name withheld) has confessed on Rainbow Radio 87.5Fm that her husband is not the biological father of her first child.

The woman says she has not prepared to disclose or confess but was going through pain and depression over the matter.

She claimed she had no choice but to give the child to her current husband as his because his former boyfriend was unprepared to be a father.

In recounting her ordeal, she stated that the person responsible requested that she abort the baby because he was not ready to be a father at the time.

She claimed her previous boyfriend offered her GHC200 to have the baby aborted.

She told Kwabena Agyapong that she had accepted the proposal of the husband because of the circumstance, making him the father of the first child, and now they have a set of twins after the first child.

""I am married, but my first child was not fathered by my husband. My ex-boyfriend is the father of the child. When I became pregnant, my ex-boyfriend stated that he was not prepared to be a father. He gave me GHC200 to have the baby aborted. However, I refused to abort. I refused to have an abortion because I was afraid, and I had heard stories about women who had abortions and died as a result. At the same time, a man entered my life, and despite the fact that I did not love him, he was willing to marry me. Because his family was wealthy, I had no choice but to marry him.

Reactions as taxi driver rains heavy curses on lady who milked him dry and jilted him,"Netizens are reacting to a viral video of a taxi driver profusely raining heavy curses at his ex-lover and her family.

After chronicling events that led to the lady abandoning him, the young man, identified as Nana Poku, was seen evoking a deity with a bottle of Schnapp and eggs to wipe out the said ladys entire family.

Prior to the development, Nana Poku was captured on social media painfully narrating how the lady, who he lived with, cheated on her after providing for her and her family. 

The taxi driver, popularly known as, One Ghana, said after spending a fortune to enroll his lover (Maame Yaa) in school, she had jilted him for another man.

Nana Poku said he had spent all his life savings on the lady but all he got in return was scorn.

A lady I was with, I spent money and bought her a machine and even paid money for her to learn sewing. I am even preparing myself to marry her so she can be all mine and later learn the trade. I provide all her needs and I have even bought a phone for her. But today, I was with her and all of a sudden, she wants to go to school. I told her that if she intends to go to school, she should break up with me because I wont be able to stand the competition with different men. I later heeded and took her to school. 

Now the lady has totally run me down. Things are really hard for me and the car owner has come for his car. As it stands, I am jobless. Now she has her own job whiles schooling. She does what she likes. It has come to my knowledge that men even pick her with big cars and take her to hotels. She will go and do whatever she likes with the man and come back home and sleep by me, he stated.

Nana Poku established that the ladys family is solidly backing their daughter instead of apologizing or even making an attempt to appease him.

Nana said the ladys family has threatened to drag him to court on the basis that he devirginized their daughter and has since been camping her.

Nana Poku who feels cheated, has not taken things lightly. In a video making rounds online, the taxi driver was seen hurling curses at the lady and her family.

I met Maame Yaa while she was a virgin and then all of a sudden, she claims that I am out of her league because after funding her schooling.  I met Maame Yaa at a time she had a child, I looked after her and her entire family but after milking me dry, she claims not to love me anymore. Her parents are telling me trash. I met Maame Yaa when she was selling boiled eggs. After putting me through all these, I want you to strike her and deal with her. Kill her mother and use Maame Yaa to clean your sword.

I have given her mother money several times, but if today, they want to adopt a legal means of addressing this issue instead of begging me, let them die and fall off one after the other like ripe bananas on a tree, he stated.

Ive fallen in love with my sisters husband after threesome - Student confesses,"A video of a young lady who confessed her sexual escapade with her elder sister and husband to Prophet Elisha Osei Kofi, Head Pastor, Founder and Leader of Grace Family Church International has surfaced online and it is shocking.

 The Level 200 University student who prefers to be called Asantewaa said she has fallen in love with her sisters husband after the three had sex at the same time together (threesome).

 According to Asantewaa, her Elder sister and her husband suggested she stay with them because her school was closer to their house.

 She said they were both very good to her but one day, her sister made a wish to her husband that she wants to do something crazy thing about sex on her birthday and suggested a threesome.

 When she made the request, her husband asked who would be the third person and her sister mentioned her.

 After going out with them, Asantewaa said they all got drunk and the next morning, she woke up naked with her sister and her husband on the same bed, saying she does not remember how they all got back home.

 The Lady in question said after the incident, there has been tension in the house and after two months, she realised that she was pregnant.

 She said when she told her sisters husband, he requested for sex again from her and told her to keep the pregnancy because her sister had never given the man a child since they got married five years ago.

 The Lady said she consented to the sex because she had fallen in love with the man, admitting that he is a fine man.

 Earlier, Asantewaa said when she realised she was naked in her sisters matrimonial bed, she confronted her sister and she accepted there was sex but looked ashamed.

 As at now, she said she is keeping the pregnancy because the man was happy about it and has promised to marry her.

 When asked why she had not aborted the baby, she said in her family, they do not abort pregnancies.

 She admitted that she has also been having sex with the man because she has fallen in love with him and does not know what to do because she is confused.

 Meanwhile, when the Pastor asked her how she would feel if she was in her sisters shoes, she said she would feel bad.

 Prophet Elisha Osei Kofi who became emotional about the matter told Asantewaa that she needed a psychologist, adding that he could not handle the matter alone.",,Tabloid, 16 April 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/I-rsquo-ve-fallen-in-love-with-my-sister-rsquo-s-husband-after-threesome-Student-confesses-1750193

87-year-old spiritualist who asked a little boy to suck his tongue apologizes,"Popular spiritual leader, Dalai Lama, has apologized after being slammed on social media for asking a little boy to suck his tongue at an event.

Netizens on social media have expressed disgust, after chancing on the said video which has since gone viral on Twitter.

But reacting to the numerous backlashes he has since encountered, his office has issued a statement apologizing to the boy and his family as well as individuals across the world, for the hurt his actions may have caused.

His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras, parts of the statement read.

Background

At an event, a young boy approached the popular Buddhist leader cum YouTuber, and asked, Can I hug you?

The spiritual leader then invited the boy on stage and pointed to his cheek and said, first here, prompting the boy to give him a hug and a kiss.

The Dalai Lama then pointed to his lips, and said: then I think finally here also. He then pulls the boys chin and kisses him on the mouth.

And suck my tongue, he said after a few seconds, poking his tongue out.

Although the identity of the boy is not known, he was at an event with the M3M Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Indian real estate company M3M Group based in Dharamshala, India, where the Dalai Lama lives.

Bro we can cancel the Dalai Lama without circulating that disgusting video. The description was enough. Dylan Ali (@dylanali_) April 10, 2023 

This is NOT playful banter & so inappropriate to use 'affectionately plants kiss' alongside 'suck my tongue'. Hugs are fine not this.

I slept with my own son  Ex-lesbian confesses,"An ex-lesbian, identified as Bernie, has recounted some of her bizarre sexual escapades.

In an interview with Arnold Alavanyo on the Vibes in 5 show, Bernie recalled an instance where her young school son willingly offered himself to her, as a sex tool.

Narrating what led to her encounter, she said it all started with a post on her WhatsApp status.

I had it with my own son. Sometimes I post on my WhatsApp status that I feel like I miss my girls. I feel like going back to any of them to have sex with them and then he said, Oh mummy, you dont deserve this. Use me as your vibrator. 

""He said he has the real vibrator, and then I asked what his real vibrator was and he said his penis. That was when I noticed that my son isnt that old but he has a big prick. She is not my biological son though, she is my school son.

Asked how many times she had since slept with the young man whose age wasnt disclosed, Bernie said:

It was just once, but he has been calling me and telling me that he has missed me. He said anytime I want it he is available to make me happy. I did enjoy it, he was able to satisfy me but he is my son so I cant continue.

Bernie, who claims to have dropped the cloak of lesbianism and masturbation, however, established that since there is no man currently in her life, she intends to continue with their secret affair.

Now that there is no man in my life, my son is there to make me happy. 

Meanwhile, her statements have since triggered massive comments on social media with netizens calling for her arrest.

Condemning the practice which they have termed as molestation, some critics have drawn the attention of the police.

American porn star Nasir sends message to Shugatiti as orgasm challenge delays,"King Nasir has said he is not interested in dating Shugatiti after the Ghanaian actress and nudist asked her followers to choose between musician Gambo and the American porn star. 

For over a week, Nasir and Shugatiti have been trending on social media over orgasm. Shugatiti in an interview had said she has never reached an orgasm and doubted she would ever experience it with a man, triggering a response from Nasir who said he was ever ready to assist the nudist.

After days of anticipation from netizens which was ignited by social media posts from both Nasir and Shugatiti, the latter on March 11, 2023, shared a seventeen-seconds racy video of herself with the caption: Ohk lets settle this @gambo_ii or @KingNasirXXX.

In response, Nasir without mincing words said: Theres nothing to settle, he can have you... I dont wanna date you. The only reason Im entertaining this is to prove I can make you orgasm since you publicly claimed youve never had one in your entire life.

Meanwhile, Nasir has announced he needs another challenge.

I need a new opponent from Ghana. Which woman would you pick to challenge me? he asked. 

Since the post was made, some tweeps have been tagging Efia Odo. The actress who recently decided to venture into music has retorted, describing those who mentioned her as goats.

You people tagging me in this post are all Aponkyes, she fumed.

American porn actor King Nazir to storm Ghana in search of Shugatiti,"After trending in Ghana consistently as a result of his interactions with Shugatiti on Twitter, American actor, King Nazir has disclosed his intentions to visit Ghana.

King Nazir seems to have developed a special interest in the Ghanaian nudist after he offered to help her reach orgasm.

Shugatitis post where she claimed to have issues with experiencing orgasm went viral and, in the quest to help, the American actor is doing everything humanely possible to make that happen from all indications.  

After soliciting funds for a live telecast of a sex match between him and Shugatiti, Nazir has taken his plans to the next level.

The porn actor who seemingly cannot wait to visit Ghana said he intends to spend some time with Shugatiti and embark on a few media rounds.

 In a viral phone call interview on Twitter, he said:

I would love to do that in her home country. I would just love to really hear her thoughts and here some of the thoughts of the locals, the news publications, podcasts and so on. Anybody that has any interest in this interaction between me and her, will definitely see what happens, for sure.

According to King Nazir, he had always planned on touring Africa, and as such, he finds the timing right to make Ghana his first stop. 

It wasnt my intention to come to Ghana specifically but once this became as big as it became and we started trending, it sort of diverted my original plans. Now I wouldnt mind going to Ghana first. It was already my intention to come to Africa, he maintained.

Sex toys have unprecedented effects on women  Actress reveals,"Ghanaian actress and Fashion designer, Amma Serwaa, has advised ladies who use sex toys to be cautious as it might have negative effects on them.

According to her, some ladies who use it a lot are at a disadvantage of never being satisfied with men because they will always prefer sex toys.

This is why most men get jealous when their women use dildos because it reduces their self-esteem, she stated on e.tv Ghanas number one adult edutainment show In Bed with Adwen.

She revealed that apart from them having issues in their relationships or not being in a relationship at all, most women who use sex toys are usually accused of being lesbians or witches.

She believes that there are lots of misconceptions about ladies who use them but the fact is that some of these ladies just have a big sex drive and love to have long sex.

Some men are unable to meet their expectations so, this is why they turn to sex toys instead to satisfy them. Thinking about it, the sex toys can be used anytime and anywhere until the woman is satisfied unlike a man who will get tired after a few rounds, she added.

Moving on she also added that some ladies also use it to avoid pregnancy as the toy cannot impregnate.

However, she advised women to be careful when using it because anything positive also has its negative side hence, the need for them to be cautious.

Im not against anyone using it but be careful when using it because although its giving you pleasure, it also has its disadvantages and it can be lifelong, she highlighted.",,Tabloid,  3 February 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Sex-toys-have-unprecedented-effects-on-women-ndash-Actress-reveals-1707668

Economic crisis: Koforidua sex workers appease customers with beat-down charges this yuletide,"""We have reduced our prices to make Christmas exciting for you so come and patronise us,"" some commercial sex workers at Koforidua, the Eastern Regional capital have shockingly revealed.

Speaking to the reporter as the world gear up for the Yuletide, the prostitutes indicated that business has been down since the economic hardship broke out and are therefore devising strategies to get more customers.

""For some time now, business has been bad due to complaints of the current economic hardship. We have lost most of our customers because they also find it difficult to afford our prices"".

""Before the economic crises, we use to charge at least Ghc50 for a short time and an average of Ghc150 for night service but as we speak to you now, we barely get half of the above charges, and this is a big problem to us"" some sex workers lamented.

However, they are urging male patronisers to resort to them for their services as they are willing to beat down the price as a way of helping to cushion them from economic hardship.

""We know things are hard now so we are prepared to accept as low as Gh20 for short time and Ghc80-Ghc100 night services,"" prostitutes told Bryt FMs Nyarko Abronoma.

Since I started the journey, it took ten years to settle in Germany. Ive lived in Switzerland, Belgium, and France, but for two weeks each. If the country does not feel like home, I go to another country. I check a few things in the country to see if they can accommodate me, he told DJ Nyaami.

Kelvin made a stowaway journey through the Mediterranean Sea to Europe and first landed in Italy before scouting for an accommodating country to settle in. He finally settled in Germany due to a few reasons.

"I made GH20,000 in three months but business is now bad  Sex worker","The impact of the current economic hardship in Ghana is cutting across all spheres.

A commercial sex worker, Ama, which is her pseudo-name, has shared how the state of the economy is impacting her trade.

The Nigerian who arrived in Ghana about a year and a half ago, said she made over GHC20, 000 in her first three months of selling sex.

Last year when I came here, I used two months to make a lot of money. You people call it twenty thousand, which is two hundred million [old cedis]. I used three months to make such an amount last year. But up until now, I have not gotten such an amount,"" she told Oyerepa TV's Kwasi Parker Wilson in a special report.

According to Ama, her usual clients now come to her with very little money to offer for her services due to their economic situation.

""Now it is worse than last year because they are complaining everywhere that there is no money. Some of them who used to pay GHC100, now when they come, they will tell you they don't have money. What they have is GHC20 or GHC40 and you cannot send them back because they have been your customers and now there is no money. So now we are working with consideration,"" she said.

She is, however, hopeful that the current situation will improve for her trade to thrive so she can return back to her country.

Ghanaians have recently been hit hard with economic hardship brought about by high inflation, persistent increase in fuel prices as well as a depreciating local currency.

I married someone who qualifies to be lucifer -  Man discloses,"A middle-aged man who has identified himself as Amos claims that he married a woman who qualifies to be the devil himself.

Speaking with Arnold Elavanyo on his Vibez in 5, Amos indicated that his wife aborted their first child less than one year after marriage and denied him sex.

According to him, she got pregnant again claiming that it was the previous pregnancy which wasnt properly terminated and still wanted to terminate it.

There was excitement and happiness when we got married but it didnt take long and the shocks started coming. When she got pregnant, I was the happiest person and I was excited. I said yeah, Im going to be a father. 

Then she called me and said this pregnancy was going to interfere with her career, so, she wanted to abort it, and that, I should give her money to do the abortion. I said, "" No, I was young, and for me, I was not perfect, and I cannot claim to be perfect but contribute to the abortion or the killing of my first child, he narrated.

According to the man, after he refused, his wife got home one day and told him that she had done an abortion which infuriated him. 

He disclosed that his wife also stopped having sex with him because she didnt want to get pregnant.

""Yeah, she put it (sex) on hold. She will tell you that she is not in the mood and she cannot. If we continued the sex life again, it was possible she would get pregnant again and then there will be a problem. 

""So she wanted to regulate the marriage. Regulate sex. So as this happened, I saw that, no, this lady was up to about to do something. Then you could see that her movement was changing. She will tell you that she was going to work and  I will get calls from her workplace and they will tell me my wife has not come to work,"" he shared.

As per Amos, after his wife's abortion, he noticed that she had changed and was sneaky with so many things.

Not long after, Amos claims his wife got pregnant again and when he confronted her, she said it was the old pregnancy which wasn't terminated properly and would want to abort it.

""I asked her if she was pregnant, and she said yes, the old pregnancy. So if it was the previous pregnancy, it means we need to calculate from that time and let's see. Because a normal pregnancy is nine months. 

""She decided that she was going to abort that one too. According to her this one too was my baby which I didn't believe because our sex life was on hold,"" he revealed.

Amos revealed that in the end, his wife was diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases while still pregnant, and a test he conducted marked him negative for the STI.

"'Leave GH4,000 behind for caskets before your death' - Abusuapanyin warns family members after price hike","Prices of coffins and caskets in the Ashanti region have increased due to economic hardships in the country.     As a result, a bereaved family head said in an interview with unique news shared his frustration with the price hike and decided to back home with options for his family members.     I will discuss with my family to adopt the Muslim method. We would get a metal coffin that can be reused whenever a family member dies because I bought one recently at GH1,200, but it is GH3,000 today.

Due to the economic hardship, we no longer accept any part payment for these caskets because the prices of materials keep changing, and we dont want to run at a loss, Ato, manager of Gods way Casket Shop, said.",,Tabloid,  7 November 2022,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Leave-GH-cent-4-000-behind-for-caskets-before-your-death-Abusuapanyin-warns-family-members-after-price-hike-1657910
Ghanaian women are attracted to me because I speak Twi fluently - Korean-Ghanaian,"Nicholas Kim Young was born to a Ghanaian mother and a South Korean father. The 27-year-old has lived in Ghana for most of his life and only visited Korea once before his fathers demise.    Speaking on SVTV Africa with DJ Nyaami, Nicholas indicated that he has no connection to Korea because he was raised here and only knows Ghana to be his home.     DJ Nyaami quizzed Nicholas on how people, especially women react when they see him. He responded that women are naturally attracted to him.     I dont go out looking for women. They come to me mostly. Women are amused and amazed when they hear me speaking Twi, but they like it. They dont believe me when I tell them I was born in Ghana because of my skin colour, he said.    Following in his actor-brother, Se Korea Se Chinas footsteps, Nicholas wishes to venture into the creative industry as a Dancehall artiste.     He expressed his love and admiration for Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale and added that he wishes to be like him someday.      I choose Dancehall because of Shatta Wale.

I curse people who cancel trips without reason - Bolt driver says after hikes in fuel prices,"Ride-hailing service driver Gabriel Nartey-Kwao has disclosed that he threatens to curse riders who cancel orders without reason because not only do they lose fuel, but it also affects their driving score.    In an interview on Daily Hustle on SVTV Africa, Gabriel mentioned some challenges they face. He indicated that each cancelled trip affects their driving score, and they ran at a loss. As a result, he calls riders who cancel orders and threaten to curse them.    When you dont accept a ride order as the app has given you, your activity drops. But, sometimes, the rider also cancels the ride and reports that I asked them to cancel even after I have accepted. Meanwhile, I never asked them, and the score drops after that.     When that happens, the driver is blocked out of the system. I dont take such things lightly these days. I will threaten to curse you if they dont find a reasonable excuse for me, and they send me MOMO to compensate me because Ive wasted fuel to get to your destination, Emmanuel explained.    On sex for rides, Gabriel confessed to having sex with a rider as payment for a ride. He mentioned that sex workers patronize him more due to the time he works.",,Tabloid,  4 November 2022,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/I-curse-people-who-cancel-trips-without-reason-Bolt-driver-says-after-hikes-in-fuel-prices-1656575
Man trapped after bonking customer now sugar mummy,"After engaging in an amorous relationship with a customer he has once helped, a man feels trapped and insecure about his life and the future relationship with his girlfriend.    Godwin, a former salesman at the Accra Mall, met the new lady when she visited the shopping centre to get some groceries.    After helping her with her groceries to her car at the car park and she took my number and we started talking, he said on a program dubbed Confessions on TV3, monitored by Angelonline.com.gh.    According to him, the lady is almost 20 years older than I am and we started talking and conversation got more interesting and we became lovers.    When asked whether he had a girlfriend, Godwin denied it.    According to him, he started to be intimate with her after the woman bought him a car, rented an apartment for him and got him a better-paying job.    He said, to play my cards well I arranged for her to only come to the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays and then my girlfriend will come on Friday to spend the weekend.    But unfortunately, one Saturday, the woman showed up at his house to find him making love with his girlfriend.    He said he feels trapped because after the woman found him out with his girlfriend she has remained silent about it and anytime he tries talking about it she would say its okay and I shouldnt worry.    Beyond the discomfort about the silence, Godwin disclosed that his sugar mummy gave him an oily product in a bottle to smear on his manhood whenever he will make love to his girlfriend.    This, he intimated, scares him a lot because he does not know if using it before sex with his girlfriend may cause the death of the girlfriend or if something bad would happen to himself.    Caught in a web, he said, If I let this woman go, we are going to go back to ground zero...shes going take back the car, the apartment and I may even lose the job because I know what shes capable of doing.    Worst of all, Godwin feels she could just come into the house to cause harm to him or his girlfriend because she could even ask for anything to be done to me while driving the car or even when going to work and that makes him uncomfortable.    Meanwhile, he has said nothing about the situation to his girlfriend for fear of losing her too.",,Tabloid,  4 November 2022,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Man-trapped-after-lsquo-bonking-rsquo-customer-now-sugar-mummy-1656089
Azuka is an angel who stands 2000 inches tall - Ogya Nyame,"Ghanaian preacher and leader of the Shinning Grace Chapel International,  Prophet Isaac Appiah, known chiefly as Prophet Azuka or Ogya Nyame has explained that he 'serves' a male angel known as Azuka.    According to the prophet, Azuka is a male angel who stands about 2000 inches tall and has been put in charge to bless Africans and provide for their needs.    The question many have been looking for an answer to is whether he believes in God.    The preacher whose 'strange' prophetic deliverances and miracles have gone viral on social media in an interview with GhanaWeb's Paula Amma Broni disclosed that it was God who called him to preach the good news.    ""God revealed to me that Azuka is the angel put in charge of blessing Africans. He helps people..."" he said. ""You can google it, he is not a demon or dwarf. Before you can take up that name and spirit, you need to meet some demands. You can't just pick up a name, you need to perform some directions before it can grow. I was told that that force was my ticket to conquering Africa. It is manifesting, my videos are viral on TikTok and in Africa.""    ""My angel is male, he is 2000 times taller than me and yes I have seen his face before,"" he told GhanaWeb in an interview with Paula Amma Broni on Talkertainment.    Prophet Azuka has instructed his critic to humble themselves as he educates them on how things operate in the spiritual realm.    He added that one requires spiritual eyes to appreciate his works.    ""I can transform into an angel, I can come to you in different forms and shapes and you wouldn't recognize me. I can transform myself into a madman and anything physically.    ""I can transform into an old woman and take something precious from you. The country doesn't understand things of the spirit so I will tell them to just keep quiet! Humble yourself and let us bless you with what we have,"" these are the words of Prophet Azuka to critics.",,Tabloid,  1 November 2022,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Azuka-is-an-angel-who-stands-2000-inches-tall-Ogya-Nyame-1654472
I dare my critics to inquire from God whether I'm fake or not - Prophet Azuka,"Prophet Azuka also known as Ogya Nyame has for years been tagged as a fake man of God by a section of Ghanaians who have punched wholes in ministry.    Despite the negative perception of his brand and church known as the Shinning Grace Chapel International, he continues to live his best life. As he loves to put it, the goal is to please God and not man.    ""I don't do things to please man but instead God. I don't care what someone has to say about me,"" the preacher said.    The Ghanaian preacher who spoke to Paula Amma Broni on GhanaWeb TV's Talkertainment dared his critics to provide evidence that will confirm that he is not a genuine preacher.    ""What do we understand when we talk about things of the spiritual? You can't see things in the spirit unless you have a spiritual eye. They have no idea of what I carry and that is exactly what I want to clarify in this interview.    ""Ghanaians will judge you by the dress you wear and how you look. We don't pray to enquire from God, we just judge. Both the fetish priest and pastor claim I am not from God. They all claim I don't serve God but something else, how did they know? They just judge me without a just course,"" he told GhanaWeb.    He maintained that he worships God and seeks to win souls for his kingdom.    ""I dare you if you claim that God has indeed called you into ministry, pray and ask him if I am a true prophet. Ask God how Prophet Azuka got his power,"" he charged naysayers.

God has given me power over Ghana and Africa - Prophet Azuka,"Ghanaian preacher and leader of the Shinning Grace Chapel International, Prophet Isaac Appiah, known chiefly as Prophet Azuka or Ogya Nyame, announced that God has put him in charge of Ghana and the entire African continent.    In one of Prophet Azuka's many encounters with God, he was promised control over nations.     In an exclusive interview with GhanaWeb, the prophet said God made him great among nations when he accepted his call to preach the good news to Christians.    The man of God has earned the tag as being 'controversial' due to his strange miracles but according to him, critics lack knowledge of what happens in the spiritual realm.    Speaking to GhanaWeb's Paula Amma Broni on Talkertainment he said: ""In an encounter with God, he told me the special gift upon my life. He gave me the power of fire. That was what I was going to work with and so I launched into the scene with the name, Ogya Nyame (God of fire)...it is on all platforms but now I am also known as Azuka. God again told me to adopt the name, Amansie Nsoroma.    ""When God called me into his ministry, He told me that I was going to be in charge of Africa and have control over the world. His promise was to put Ghana in my care.""    Based in Kumasi and Accra, the leader of the Shinning Grace Chapel International plans on spreading his tentacles to the rest of the world.

Married man destroys girlfriend's Range Rover after he allegedly caught her cheating,"A Nigerian married man identified as Olufunmilayo Ochuko Edo, caused a scene at a popular Lagos Night club when he destroyed a Range Rover belonging to his side-chick, Ifeyinwa after she allegedly cheated on him.    In a video making rounds on social media, Ochucho was captured in the company of security guards who restrained him from inflicting harm on his girlfriend and further ruining the vehicle.    According to reports, he was said to have traced Ifenyiwa to the nightclub upon a tip-off only to find out that she was in the company of another man.    Upon arrival at the scene, he decided to take revenge by damaging the exterior of her car and breaking its glasses and side mirrors.    Mr. Ochuko Edo was also heard yelling that he bought his girlfriend the car while labeling her a prostitute for cheating on him.    Ifenyiwa on the other hand went haywire, as it took the intervention of some guards to prevent her from doing the worst.     Chancing on the video on social media, many have expressed shock at seeing how a married man could publicly fight over another woman.    Others have lambasted the married man for shamelessly overreacting over a side-chick.    However, Ife has spoken on the entire incident;    I never knew he would go this far as he saw me at W-bar lounge chilling yesterday and decided to destroy the car I bought with my hard-earned money. He was screaming on top of his voice that he bought the car for me which is a lie from the pit of hell. I bought the Range in May 2022, with some of the money I got from selling my Venza.     ""This man has never bought even a bicycle for me. This is a clear case of mental derangement cause I never asked him to leave his wife and kids for me as he claimed in the viral video.

We dont wear diapers  Ghanaian gay debunks rumours,"A Germany-based Ghanaian gay, Maswood Hussein, popularly known as Madea, has shot down rumours that people of his caliber usually wear pads to absorb fluids that flow out of their private parts.    There is the assertion that the lining of the rectum, due to how delicate it gets during rough sex, can cause damage.    Other reports indicate that the rapid and forceful overstretching of the anus can tear the anal sphincter and, in some cases, the bowels cannot be controlled due to its loose nature.    This, according to some critics, often drives a lot of individuals who regularly have annal sex, particularly gays, to wear tampons to stop the poop.    But reacting to these assertions, Madea labeled such claims as ""big fat lies.""    Anyone who claims that gays wear pads or pampers is a big liar. Our private parts dont leak. Did you spot any pad the whole time you have been here? Why would I wear pampers? For what? And with the other rumours that our anus usually widens, I can strip for you to see for yourself. Its a complete lie,"" he stated in an interview with Zionfelix.    Touching on some assertions that gay men usually battle countless health complications, Madea added;  If someone says that gays usually have a lot of health complications, then they are lying.

Some men cheat because of bad attitude from their wives,"Ghanaian female broadcast journalist, Debbielyn Jackson has stated that some bad behaviours and characters of most women/ladies are the reasons why men/guys cheat in relationships.    Debbielyn Jackson a.k.aOhemaa prove them wrong' who has recently taken it upon herself of advising her fellow women/ladies about relationship issues made this statement on one of her social media platforms (Facebook) whilst she was advising them.    According to Ohemaa prove them wrong she said, most married men and guys are cheating in their relationships due to some higgledy-piggledy attitudes and the characters of some women and young ladies. She said a lot of women/ladies are soo rude to the extent that, they even insult their own husbands/guys which is very bad. Ohemaa said the rate at which some women/ladies treat their partners in relationships is so appalling and unbearable.     She said some women/ladies control their partners anyhow with no respect and men/guys dont like that at all. Ohemaa said, men are not supposed to be treated harshly but rather pamper them. Ladies like pampering likewise men/guys too. She said men dont like it when they are being treated harshly or anyhow, it really hurts them a lot so women/ladies should try and treat their partners nicely and lovely and stop this their uncultured characters.    Later Ohemaa said, if you see your man cheating on you, dont fight or insult him but rather talk to him in a polite manner. She said, insulting and fighting your man because he is cheating on you will never solve it but rather gives him the vim to continue because of the insult and the fight. Ohemaa said, some women/ladies even go to the extent of picking the number of the new women/lady that their partners are going out with, fighting, insulting, and threatening them.     She said, if you do that, you are uncivilized and uncultured. Fighting, insulting and threatening the new woman/lady will even worsen your case so ladies should stop that. Deal with your man/guy in a mature way when you see him cheating on you, its painful though but thats the best way to go about it.     She said men/guys should also respect themselves and stop cheating in relationships because it doesnt add any value or benefits. If you are a man/guy and you cant stick to one woman/lady, meaning you dont respect yourself and dont even know what you really want in this life, she added.    Finally, she urged all cherished viewers of Hitz Factory and her fans to keep on supporting Debbielyn Jacksons brand and the show.",,Tabloid, 15 October 2022,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Some-men-cheat-because-of-bad-attitude-from-their-wives-1643477

Ghanaians are wicked people  Avram Ben Moshee,"Leader of Common Sense Family, Avram Ben Moshe has called all Ghanaians wicked for not supporting other Ghanaians when they need it.

Per his observation, most Ghanaians will rather support an outsider rather than help them succeed and support other Ghanaians.

In an interview with Rev Nyansa Boakwa on Happy 98.9 FMs NsemPii, he said, Twene Jonas can upload a video on YouTube and about 9 hours later you notice only 2000 people have viewed the video but a Ghanaian doesnt mind streaming Messis video non-stop on YouTube which doesnt make sense to me.

Citing another example he said, If you go on an Indians YouTube site youll see encouraging views like 6million views, 120million views and others. Although they are more populated than we are they support their own unlike Ghanaians.

He went on to say, Ghanaians are wicked to the extent that, they will rather prefer to watch videos of foreigners like Jay Z and Beyonce but not support a Ghanaian artiste like Nero X or Strongman whereas foreigners will always support their people till they get to the top but Ghanaian never do that they rather criticize you and try to bring you down.

Avram emphasized that, until Ghanaians change their attitude and begin to support their own like they do to other countries, Ghana will continue to be at a standstill.",,Tabloid,  7 June 2021,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ghanaians-are-wicked-people-Avram-Ben-Moshee-1280818
Poverty is caused by witches attacking our leaders - Bishop Salifu Amoako,"Archbishop Elisha Salifu Amoako has attributed the poor state of many African people to the work of witchcraft and nothing else. 

The problem of Africans in poverty is caused by witchcraft, he told Maame Grace in an exclusive interview on Sunday on a show called Revelations.

According to him, the problem of poverty is not only an African issue but cuts across the continent to every black person. And to him, poverty is caused by the works of witchcraft and idol worship. 

He explained that our forefathers worshipped many bad spirits and idols and these have caused many problems for Africans across the world. 

The host, Apostle Maame Grace asked him why our leaders who are mostly Christians have not been able to solve the problems of Africa. Answering this, Archbishop Salifu Amoako stated that, most of our leaders are religious but not born-again Christians. ""They mostly go to orthodox churches and practice dark occultism in the name of being Christians. They are not believers and born again"" - he reiterated. 

To him, the leadership of Africa is under spiritual and witchcraft attack. That is the biggest problem in Africa, he explained. 

""Everywhere theres a black man in the world, theres the same African problem""  - Bishop Salifu Amoako. 

Over 70% of global poverty is in African countries

While poverty rates had been slowly increasing on the continent since the beginning of the SDG period (less than 1% in the previous 2 years), from 2019-2020, the number of people living in extreme poverty in Africa is projected to jump by approximately 8% to nearly 520 million Africans. This is around 40% of the entire population of 1.3 billion on the continent. Data according to OECD. 

In the 21st Century, there are 77 gods being worshipped at Cape Coast. These are bringing curses onto the land. Our ancestors worshipped rivers and trees when the world was driving towards God. When you do what God dislikes, you invite his curse on you. Curses reduce you. That is why Africa has been cursed with poverty even though we have all the natural resources in the world. 

We have diamond, cocoa, and gold but we are the poorest of the poor. - Bishop Salifu Amoako. 

""People are committing crimes and doing blood sacrifices looking for quick money. These are acts of witchcraft manipulation. Poverty, sickness, hatred, suffering are all manifestations of witchcraft"". Bishop Salifu Amoako explained.", Kelly Nii Lartey Mensah,Tabloid,  7 June 2021,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Poverty-is-caused-by-witches-attacking-our-leaders-Bishop-Salifu-Amoako-1280659
"Ghanaians behave like animals, democracy won't work - Retired military woman","Retired military officer, Hajia Aisha Alhassan has revealed that democracy has not helped Ghana and suggested that our system of governance should be an authoritative one.

In an interview with DJ Nyaami on SVTV Africa, Hajia stated that democracy is not properly practised as people are threatened anytime they speak up.

If we had freedom of speech, people would not be beaten for saying the right one. I would prefer authoritative governance. Democracy is too feeble for us, we need iron hands. Maybe I'm talking as a soldier but it is what Ghanaians want. We need to be forced to do things. Back then people were scared to misbehave. Now, we are living like animals instead of using our senses and discretion. Purple litter and ask where the AMA is. That is why we experience flood every year, she said.

Having served in the army for 12 years, Miss Alhassan retired in the early 80s. She confirmed that being in the army has been beneficial to her.

My father reported me for deportation: Woes of a young Ghanaian entrepreneur surviving abroad,"A young Ghanaian man recounts his turbulent experience with his father while striving hard to break through the odds in a foreign land.

Eric Watson in an interview with MzGee narrated how his father connived to have him deported back to Ghana. He said he lost hope when his biological father reported him to law enforcement in the US as an illegal immigrant.

He said his father made false reports about his first marriage with an African American lady, which would have guaranteed his green card. And permanent stay in the United States.

I met my first wife in school, and we got married. She filed for me and for some reasons, it took more than the usual six months of a response from the immigration office. So I had to follow up on it. I was arrested at the same point for having a fake marriage. This was reported by an unknown caller. Apart from my roommate, nobody knew about it.

The young man formerly known as Eric Okyere said he had a tough time with his father while schooling. He revealed how his father forced him to pay for house rent while schooling and his refusal to settle his tuition fee. He had no option than to search for a job to see himself through school whiles living with a fellow Ghanaian.

I came for schooling here for one year, and I called my dad. He agreed to allow me to stay with him. So I came to America to meet him for the first time in my life at age 26. 

""I was excited, but he wasnt. He asked me to leave the house, and we had stayed for only a few months and asked me to pay rent. I was a student, and I couldnt afford it. My stepmother loved me so much and paid my school fees for the first semester. But my dad wont do it. 

""I all the work I was doing, I was saving up for the next semester. Then I met a Ghanaian brother and he took me in just like that, and he is the same person that connected me to the job I was doing. And a stranger called Yaw and he helped me, he said.

He told MzGee about how he spent months in jail because of his dad reports about allegations of a fake marriage. He disclosed how good Samaritan paid 30,000 dollars to have him released and his decision to remain in the US to pursue his life opportunities.

When I was arrested, this lady in the church asked about me from my pastor in the church. She had to pay about 30,000 dollars to release me. Afterwards, I was asked to choose between going back to Ghana or staying in the US. I choose the US because the system in Ghana wasnt working. I was processed for court, and the audio of the caller was played in court. It was nobody but my father. I was lost for words, and I nearly collapsed, he shared.

Eric Okyere changed his name to Eric Watson when he realized that his Dad refused to plead for a change. When the need arises and had to resort to using his mothers maiden name Watson. He has survived through all the pains and has successfully achieved a career through his experience.

 To him, fair women usually go through unsuccessful, unstable marriages

He said fair ladies contribute to the majority of women who usually storm his office with masturbation problems.

Touching on the basis for his assertion, Bishop Kwabena Asiamah said he came by such findings after sampling both fair-skinned and dark-skinned women during consultations.

Fair ladies are more addicted to masturbation as compared to the darker ones. 90% of fair ladies are addicted to masturbation. If it will interest you to know, I am a prophet and a lot of women come to me for consultation. Those who usually come to me with masturbation problems are mostly fair women. I am stating my points based on comparison. You can ask those who usually sell dildos or vibrators, theyll tell you majority of their clients are fair women, he told Zionfelix.

If you are a fair lady, you need to avoid having sex in a swimming pool, in cars or even stay around the beach after 6pm. How many fair women have a sound or peaceful married life? I know of some fair Ghanaian celebrities whose marriages have been unsuccessful, he added.

 ""Since I did not have the money, I consulted a friend who paid the tenants and promised to rent it out so we can both earn from it, Francis said.

 According to Mr Agbovito, his friend eventually sold the house to Togolese footballer, Emmanuel Adebayor without his approval.

 Ghanaians on Twitter are demanding the arrest of a young man named Bondzie for allegedly knocking down a man who has been pronounced dead.

 Bondzie, as he is identified by many, has been described as a reckless driver who is fond of driving at top speed.

 In what seems to have triggered a whole campaign on Twitter, many Ghanaians appeared to be livid at the whole situation since the young man in question has not been picked up by the police for investigation.

 Information about the victim also appears sketchy.

In a chat with SVTV Africas DJ Nyaami, Charles stated that the forestry commission has instructed them not to hunt antelope in the third and fourth quarter of the year. 

He added that due to this, most of the sellers are arrested and put in cells until released on bail. 

""The forestry commission told us not to hunt from August to November because the antelopes only give birth once or twice a year unlike grasscutter, he said. 

Charles further explained that when the hunters bring the game, they are unable to reject it because that is their job.

"Marriages collapsing because people married money, jobs of their partners - Nhyiraba Kwabena Asirifi","Host of Weekend Morning Show, Nhyiraba Kwabena Asirifi, has advised the public not to marry people because they are wealthy or their profession.

He argues some marriages have collapsed because people married their partners because they fell in love with their professions and not because they were compatible.

He said some parents push their daughters, especially to marry wealthy people and not because the daughters love the partners.

Such marriages he decried dont last because when these partners lose their wealth or lose their jobs, the other partners lose interest in the marriage.

He noted that gone were the days when people married people with good character, unquestionable wealth, integrity and godliness, the generation of today, are moved by wealth, beauty and people without good behaviour.

To him, if someone is a petty trader and with a good character, it would be best to marry such a person than to marry someone with wealth who lacks respect and ungodly.

Societal pressure, he added, is also pushing many into abusive and terrible marriages.

Several people he said have been pushed into marriages only to discover their partners are criminals, social miscreants and persons with negative attitudes, with some leading to crisis, including death.

He also stated that when expectations are not met based on what the partners perceived before the marriage, it would be a recipe for disaster.

This usually the form of complaining, blaming, criticizing, nagging, threatening, he said.

They are parents asking their daughters to marry bank managers, soldiers, journalists and people are wealthy although they dont know the character of the people of how they make their money. They are only interested in their money and the profession. When you do that, the marriage will not last. It will soon collapse.

You cannot marry someone because of the job they do or their wealth. Should your partner lose these things, you will lose interest in the marriage because the reason why you accepted to marry them is no longer there. Marry someone with an unquestionable character, godly, and someone compatible, he concluded.",,Tabloid, 25 May 2021,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Marriages-collapsing-because-people-married-money-jobs-of-their-partners-Nhyiraba-Kwabena-Asirifi-1269535
Twene Jonas sets social media on fire after chastising chiefs over galamsey,"    The social media sensation is an ardent critic of the government

    As part of efforts to fight galamsey he has called out authorities, blaming them for the rise in the galamsey menace

    His outburst has divided Ghanaians on social media site, Twitter after he topped trends


A popular social media commentator has divided social media after he rained invectives on authorities in the country over what he described as poor handling of the galamsey menace.

Taking to Twitter, Twene Jonas accused government officials and chiefs in the various regions of playing key roles in the destruction of the countrys lands.

According to Jonas, chiefs who serve as custodians are to blame for the galamsey menace since they are responsible for selling the lands to individuals and corporate bodies that indulge in the destructive menace.

Some Ghanaians while reacting to the social media sensations stance have commended him for what they describe as being candid and calling out authorities.

But others have also chided him for not showing respect to those in authority, particularly traditional leaders in the country.

Government, led by the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources Samuel Abu Jinapor has intensified the fight against galamsey across the country.

A few weeks ago, a task force, implemented by the Lands Ministry raided a number of galamsey sites destroying mining equipment including excavators.

The approach has been criticised by many stakeholders, who have said the decision to burn the mining equipment is a bad move by the government.

Below are some social media reactions:

Rinsing my mouth with squirt fluid gave me white teeth  Actor reveals,"Grand Paa, a popular Ghanaian actor, has revealed that rinsing his mouth with the fluid squirted from his partner is the secret behind his white teeth.

Interviewed on Ghanas most-watched adult edutainment programme In Bed with Adwen which airs on eTV Ghana, he advised that when a man finds out that what turns his partner on the most is cunnilingus, he must please her with it to the maximum.

Fake Fetish priest reveals why he chose to scam people,"A Ghanaian man who pretends as a fetish priest and has scammed countless people has come out to confess reasons for his actions.

Coming from a very poor background where his single mother had to take care of him and his other siblings, he decided to come to Accra from the village to seek greener pastures.

The pressure from home and not being able to even buy a piece of cloth for my mother after all her suffering and sacrifices pushed me into scamming, he shared.

In an interview with Rev Nyansa Boakwa on Happy 98.9 FMs Nsem Pii, he shared, In Accra, I realized life was even tougher than I imagined and it was full of people who were also struggling. I lived with my brother here in Accra and he convinced us to go see one Mallam who can help us and change our lives.

He stated that due to desperation he went ahead with his brother to this Mallam who they later realized to have scammed them.

Upon seeing what he did, I thought I could also do same and make money to cater for my mother and siblings back in the village, he noted.

He went ahead to get the most important tool he saw the man use which was the magic black stone, made posters and pasted them around. He also bought a few pieces of red cloth and settled at a far place and started the business.

The man mentioned that not long after he did that, he started receiving phone calls from interested persons and that was how it all began for him.

I got a book in which I recorded the name, purpose and amount everyone who came to me paid because I didnt want to make any mistakes. The scheme went on well for a while and I was making enough money until I realized what I was doing wasnt advisable and now Ive changed.

I'm now Evangelist Patricia Oduro Koranteng  Fetish priestess Agradaa declares after spending a day in jail,"For years, popular Ghanaian fetish Priestess, Patricia Asiedu popularly known as Nana Agradaa has been tagged as a notorious cunning fraudster who has conned many with her purported ability to make people rich overnight.

With several efforts made by various persons who have all fallen victims of her alleged fraudulent activities, it had to take her spending a day in the coolers of the National Security to cause her repentance.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Nana Agradaa said her arrest and subsequent time spent in jail has allowed her to commit herself to preach the word of God and has therefore denounced her fetish priestess title.

Sitting here today, God has delivered me and he has changed my name from Okomfuor Agradaa. He has given me a new name, Evangelist Patricia Oduro Koranteng, she declared whiles holding a big bible followed with a song of praise.

Pastors taking tithes are stealing - Common Sense Family,"Leader of the Common Sense Family (CSF), Avraham Ben Moshe, has described head pastors of various churches across the world that collect tithe from their members as people who engage in stealing.

To him, the study of the tithe guidelines reveals that it has no application whatsoever to Christians and is violated by any pastor who takes it from church members.

Speaking on the Best Entertainment Show on Okay FM Monday morning, Avram said tithing is biblically inapplicable.

Every pastor who collects tithe is a thief. Their numerous schools and hospitals are not free. Churches and pastors havent contributed anything to the development of Ghana. Telling a woman I love you is no sin, giving a woman money is not a sin but with the mindset of giving her money in return of sexual intercourse is a sin. If the churches had not built the hospitals and schools, you mean our leaders wont have the sense to build some for us? Should it be someone who will come and build it for us?

He added. 

The black man cant survive without the white mans God, without the white mans intervention and any other thing. Is that what we are saying? We have our religion too and we dont necessarily have to be dependent on the white mans beliefs and things. Kwame Nkrumah told us that, the black man is capable of managing its own affairs so why the interference of foreign cultures and things.

Prayers

He further described persons who use one or two hours of their time to pray to God as those who lack understanding about life principles and lack the adhesion to development.

According to him, prayers do not solve any issue of life but rather hard work and dedication adding that, God himself is a principled personality and expects his children to be same in line with achieving all the needed goodness on the earth. 

God doesnt need more prayers to listen to his children. Christians that pray up to an hour have mental problems. God told his children to pray with few words to him, a Christian can pray for about 2 hours, why, are God's ears not functioning? The concept of prayer does not even make sense. The black man always thinks spirits are damaging him whiles we are lazy and careless. Prayer doesnt change the mindset of God, everything is effort  success is everything.", Justice Walker Junior,Tabloid, 27 April 2021,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Pastors-taking-tithes-are-stealing-Common-Sense-Family-1244206

Obofour and Agradaa must settle their beef in court instead of social media  Onegod,"Self-styled spiritualist, Kwaku Amoateng known as Onegod has entreated the founder and leader of Anointed Palace Chapel International, Rev Kwaku Obofour to seek legal redress in his unending tussle with female fetish priestess, Komfo Agradaaa.

According to Onegod there is no need for the man of God to be engaging with the priestess on social media as it is not the right avenue for him to seek justice over some statement made by Agradaa that impugns his integrity.

My advice to Kwaku Obofour is that if Rev Owusu Bempah has advised him to back down, he should listen and instead live the matter in the hands of the judiciary. The judiciary have been empowered by the president and they are ready to deal with your issues. The social media battle is getting too intense, he said.

Rev Obofour and Komfo Agradaa have recurrently engaged in social media fights with most of it being ignited by certain allegations the priestess keeps making against Rev Obofour. 

In his recent reply to Agradaa, Rev Obofour swore that the Priestess had drawn a battle line after three years of coming at him by insulting his wife and that he was not going to hold back against her this time around.

Explaining the spiritual angle to the fracas between Obofour and Agradaa, Ongod stated on Oman Channel that the two spiritually are a lion and a lioness respectively and that they are engaged in a spiritual battle for supremacy.

In the spiritual world it is a battle between a lion and a lioness. It is a spiritual battle, he stated.

In a related development, however, the two have become victims of a crackdown by the National Communications Authority on some unregulated TV stations.

Agradaas media house was on Wednesday raided with her two TV stations shutdown by security operatives. She was also arrested for promoting and engaging in fraud. In a subsequent release by the NCA, it listed 47 other TV stations to be shut down including Rev Obofours Ice TV and Kiss TV.

When asked by the host why he goes back to smoking if he makes the effort to put a stop to it, he answered, the devil finds work for the ideal hands, and if you dont have God, you do things that wouldnt be beneficial.

When his [Samuels] father was asked about when and how the mental issues began, he disclosed that Samuels situation started when he was in form two (2) during which he was always preaching the word of God of which usually did not make sense.

It started in form two. When it started, he preached the word of God, some of which didnt make sense. But he was never violent and has never been violent. His brains were just not like that of his other siblings.

According to Mr. Yaw Mensah, the father of Mona Mo Ble, his son was taken to Ankaful for treatment but because of the way he interacted with and answered the doctor when asked questions, he wasnt admitted.
