Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Reality zone with Vicky Wireko: Welcome to another bailout; thank God for election year,"Imagine my excitement listening live to the Finance Minister speaking at a town hall meeting in Croydon, London, last Monday on the possible bouncing back of the Ghanaian economy.


My excitement was the promise he made on that platform that day that all those owed money by defunct financial institutions will receive reimbursement in October this year. My financial anguish, after the first bailout in November 2019, was that the final payment of one’s mired retirement investment was going to be realised soon after the elections of 2020. It did not happen.


That is why for some of us, the soliloquy has been how good this recently announced bailout is. I tried to recollect the pittance payout some of us received during the first bailout as compared to one’s substantial investment that was on hold. My consolation has been that since the first bailout happened on the eve of an election year, this recent announcement will also happen since the general election was only months away.


Payout


Some of us, with alacrity, have already reached out for the forms to complete together with verification documents for good news after five years of painful waiting and watching one’s investment painfully lose critical mass in terms of its value. One cannot be more ready than now for a final and total payout which would hopefully bring one’s financial agony in this matter to a conclusive end.




Though the promise is silent on interest payments, one’s hope, for now, is that the reality of payment will happen as media reports confirm that the President himself has instructed the Minister of Finance to release a bailout amount of GH¢1.5 billion towards the exercise.


And even more encouraging is that since the President’s confirmation, one has seen the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also commencing moves for affected customers to complete the claim process in readiness for payments.


The good news for hundreds of affected persons at a time when most people are under the reel of economic squeeze is that by December 7, pockets would be beautifully lined and financial anxiety levels lowered if not eliminated.


Claim




While with a good heart, one was beginning to appreciate the promise and start the process to claim one’s stalled investment, it is disappointing for an added remark by the Minister during the town hall meeting making one wonder whether it was all a political gimmick made only in passing. He probably did not realise that some ill-communicated comments have a way of negating any good intention.


The Minister of Finance did not need to come out as if the government was favouring customers with the bailout. In one breath he informed the town hall meeting attendees that there was going to be a bailout, yet in another breath and according to media reports, he said, “Ideally, the government should not be held responsible for the investment decisions of individuals, but this government is caring.”


If he had not asked a specific question on why the bailout, he owed no one that explanation about a caring or uncaring government. The decision, in an election year, is to be left to the people whose investments came to an abrupt end and payment has become a tussle since. 


People who had worked hard all their lives saw the wisdom in putting some money aside for their future hence selecting financial companies that were seemingly licensed by regulators for which reason some had been in business for at least two decades. One understands even some institutional pension funds were invested in some such financial businesses.




So if regulators allowed such funds management companies to operate in the system, is it the fault of a worker or retiree who found it wise to put something away in terms of investment for their future, knowing how scanty state pensions were?


It was the banking restructuring of 2018 that crashed the hopes of customers with their decades of investment crumbling. In a case of this sort, why would a Minister of Finance preach good news in one breath and another want to add salt to injuries by adding that it is a caring government to have taken steps to pay out the monies? Is the waiting period of six years not hurting enough for customers for anyone to rub it in for us?


Unfortunately, things have moved so slowly for the recovery of one’s money. In the long dreadful wait, some customers never had the opportunity to enjoy their toils. They are reported to have lost their lives at a time when they needed cash for their medical treatments and medication. 


For anyone who has waited that long for their funds, the trauma alone has been crippling and sometimes even suicidal as one has learnt in the media. 




Customers will, for now, dress their wounds from the hurts and wait patiently for the bailout about to happen. Typically, it is an election year and with a few months to go, one would hold one’s breath for the fulfilment of a soon-to-come promised bailout.

Canoe Vibes with Anny Osabutey: A slice of Strasbourg,"In the middle of Alsace’s farmlands in France, a sea of Poppy flowers lures passersby onto itself. The famous flower that has become a symbol of remembrance for soldiers who fought in wars that snuffed out their breath, stood in the heart of thousands of lush green vegetation. Looking innocent and flapping its head, thanks to the direction of the wind, the red flowers provided a serene scene for first-time visitors making their way into Strasbourg.


The allure was so strong my two sons could not contain their excitement. I suggested to my wife we pull over, wander in the fields and later head into the apartment. But thought it will be ideal for us to get our bags out of the car, get the kids to use the bathroom and then head out. I agreed with her. They asked why. We offered them an explanation.








Not sure they understood but there was no protest.  The drive from the fields to the apartment was about 10 minutes. We pulled over in front of the apartment for the night. Our host, Marie, an amazing French woman with little English-speaking skills to her name (our French was all over the place, but we got by with the language app on our phones), welcomed us.


Her son, about six years old, was in tow.  He had a blonde hair. His eyes were bright and engaging. He wore a replica jersey of Paris Saint Germain; the reigning league champions in the elite division of the French league. At the back of the jersey was the name of Presnel Kimpembe, a centre-back. I asked him why not Mbappe on the back of his shirt. He offered a wry smile and darted off into their apartment.





Maybe he did not want to hear Mpabbe’s name, considering the circumstances surrounding his move to Real Madrid, I whispered. The main window in our room overlooked the green vegetation. They were mostly farmlands. I stood there for some minutes. I had flashbacks of some of the Ghanian mining towns I visited, and the scale of terror inflicted on the vegetation.




Sometimes one wonders about the level of greed in the veins of the so-called high and mighty in our society, who continue to ruin the environment for the now and the future if that secures them a lifetime of wealth acquisition and opulence. Who cares about galamsey, when there is money to be made?  The boys had a swim, got back into their clothes and we headed to see the Poppy flowers.





We pulled over in front of other vehicles whose occupants were already on the field, taking photos. I got out of the car, unbuckled the boys and marched them to the fields. They just took off before I could even get them ready. They roamed around the fields, almost interfering with a photographer who had come there to do some work. 


In another half of the fields, a female photographer, wearing faded blue jeans, a brown khaki long-sleeve shirt, and a blue Converse, was busy working her camera. The subject was a young French couple. She directed them as to how to pose. She then clicked away. “Un autre” I heard her tell the couple in French. We also did our own shoot.


We found a nearby park for the children to play. After almost an hour of jumping from zip lines to swings, their energy levels dropped. Back in the apartment, we had a light dinner and retired to bed.







We left the apartment on Sunday morning, after breakfast. We said our goodbyes to the smiling Marie and her son.  We hit the road, zigzagging through the remainder of Alsace’s enthralling farmlands, to Strasbourg. The Cathedrale Notre-Dame-de-Strasbourg was our first port of call. The weather was great. Hundreds of tourists had poured into the city to participate in various activities, including a visit to the cathedral, a masterpiece of Gothic art. Construction is said to have started in 1015 and completed in 1439.


Despite the Sunday mass at the time, tourists still queued to feast their eyes on the aesthetics.  At the main entrance are four French military officers armed to the teeth. Their red beret was slanted to the left. Their eyes were hidden behind sunglasses. They scanned the crowd to fish out miscreants with high testosterone to cause trouble. We managed to make our way into the auditorium. The mass was conducted in French. I managed to take some photos of the detailed architecture. I later pulled out my phone, and placed it next to a speaker to record the benediction.





Outside of the Cathedrale, different activities were taking place. A man hawking Strasbourg-designed merchandise walked through the crowd with the hope of getting a customer. In the far distance, a French lady serenades bystanders with a harp. Dressed in baggy jeans and a thick grey jacket, a nose ring to compliment her artistic looks, she caressed the chords with enormous patience.


Anyone moved by her performance dropped some euros in appreciation. She would then look up and say “Merci”, as she progressed to the next piece. She devoted the last performance to eulogising Strasbourg’s enchanting medieval history of imposing architecture, cuisine and multiculturalism.

Tetalestai  A note to Mawuena Adzo Dumor by Esther Cobbah,"Adzo, I have gone from deciding just to keep your tribute in my heart to now writing this little note to you.As you can imagine, your departure has left me with more questions than answers. One answer I get repeatedly is “She has finished her work. Let her go …”, and yes, Adzo, you have delivered a lot of work. 


Everything from going underground as a geologist to bring up gold, working with companies to deliver their messages and managing their relationships and reputation, to being the mind, heart and face of Ghana among investors. Being a great, loving, dutiful daughter to your mother and father who were so proud of you, a passionate big sister to your two baby brothers, and a doting mother to your princess, Katherine Joy. A precious one too too many, many seated here today and beyond.


Adzo, your departure is beyond painful, but I choose to focus on the beauty of your love, for me and for the numerous young people male and female that you mentored. You took on the load of many young women and often lived through their joys and pains with them. You became a sister, friend and mother tomany many young women, often angry about the issues they were having to deal with.


Adzo, working with you was so beautiful and easy because you appreciated and enjoyed excellence.You loved God and sought to please him in everything you did. I saw you live this till the very end. On the morning of Sunday 7th April 2024, I chose to worship with you alone and the scripture that came up in the devotional we used was John 19:25-30. 


The anchor text was, ‘When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished” With that he bowedhis head and gave up his spirit.’ “Tetelestai” - a bill had been paid, a task finished, a sacrifice offered, a masterpiece completed. For me at the time, it meant only one thing, that your suffering and pain in all their forms were going to be over and you were going to come out stronger and even better and realise all the amazing dreams you had, the plans we shared.




From then on, our prayers were just prayers of gratitude…but our Father who so generously gave you, this beautiful gift, to us had a different plan. You finished your task here on earth to take up a more noble assignment back in heaven from where you were gifted to us, for heaven knows your work and worth.Kwame, Kofi, Zara, Nana and your favourite little ones in the house- the Lilliputians as you called them (Katherine being the giant!), -are all missing you. You brought all of us so much joy.


Everyone in the house had a special place in your heart. Our home is not the same without you. Korkor is still dazed. My entire family is grieving. My friends who encountered you are just so heartbroken. I have often found myself picking up the phone to call you, or opening the house gate and expecting to see your car parked with you waiting to welcome me with your warm embrace…


Adzo, I still catch myself asking, How could this happen? I thought that “Tetelestai” in your case meant a new life here on Earth but, as the hymnist says,Blind unbelief is sure to err, And scan his work in vain;God is his interpreter, And he will make it plain.


We thank God that He gave you Katherine, your Joy, to whom you gave your all. May she grow to honour you and to be a woman after your own heart. Your dear Uncle Tsatsu says, You bravely battled through very difficult circumstances. 







Now God has taken away the earthly tent with its pain and hurts. Your generous spirit triumphs. Your impact survives. You remain in our hearts –always. You remain in our home –always. We miss your hearty laughter. We miss that twinkle –sometimes of mischief –in your eyes. We miss the intense sharing. We love you!


“Tetelestai”- Your work on this earth is finished my beloved precious jewel, Adzo, Adwoa, Ewuradwoa, Adzovi Dumor.


Rise and rejoice in Glory!

Priority setting strategies and executions for Ghanaian and African CEOs,"In the dynamic and rapidly evolving business landscapes of Ghana and Africa, CEOs face unique challenges that require strategic agility and forward-thinking. Setting priorities effectively is crucial for driving sustainable growth, fostering innovation, and ensuring the resilience of organizations. 


This article delves into the priority-setting strategies and executions employed by Ghanaian and African CEOs, highlighting their approaches to navigating the complexities of the regional and global markets.


Understanding the Context


The African continent, with its rich diversity and vast economic potential, presents both opportunities and challenges for business leaders. Ghana, as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, exemplifies this duality. CEOs in this region must address issues such as infrastructural deficits, regulatory hurdles, and socio-political instability, while also leveraging opportunities in emerging markets, technological advancements, and a young, vibrant workforce.


Strategic Priority Setting




1. Visionary Leadership and Long-term Goals: 


Successful CEOs in Ghana and Africa often start with a clear vision and long-term goals that align with their organization’s mission. This vision provides a roadmap that guides decision-making and priority setting. For instance, Strive Masiyiwa, CEO of Econet, emphasizes a long-term vision of transforming Africa through technology and connectivity, which shapes the strategic priorities of his company. Similarly, Patrick Awuah, founder and president of Ashesi University in Ghana, envisions an African renaissance driven by ethical, entrepreneurial leaders educated at Ashesi. His long-term goal is to expand the university's impact across the continent. Dr. Daniel McKorley, Group CEO of McDan Group, also exemplifies visionary leadership, with a focus on transforming logistics and aviation in Ghana and beyond. His long-term goals include expanding McDan Group’s footprint across Africa and establishing Ghana as a key logistics hub in the region.


2. Stakeholder Engagement:


Effective priority setting involves engaging with key stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, and the community. This collaborative approach ensures that the priorities reflect the needs and aspirations of those who have a vested interest in the company’s success. Patrick Awuah prioritizes stakeholder engagement to ensure that their strategies are inclusive and comprehensive. Raymond Bismarck, CEO of IZWE Savings and Loans in Ghana, regularly engages with stakeholders to understand their perspectives and align the company's strategies with their expectations.




3. Market and Competitor Analysis:


Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for setting strategic priorities. CEOs must continuously analyze market trends, competitor strategies, and customer preferences to identify growth opportunities and potential threats. For example, Aliko Dangote of the Dangote Group prioritizes market expansion and diversification based on thorough market research and competitor analysis. In Ghana, Ebenezer Asante, former CEO of MTN Ghana, emphasized understanding the local market dynamics and customer behavior to drive MTN's growth and maintain its market leadership. George Owusu Ansah, former CEO of Unilever Ghana, is another notable leader who leveraged in-depth market and competitor analysis to maintain Unilever’s competitive edge and expand its market share in Ghana.


4. Innovation and Technology Adoption:


Embracing innovation and leveraging technology are key priorities for modern CEOs. In Ghana and Africa, where digital transformation is rapidly unfolding, CEOs prioritize investments in technology to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer experience, and drive growth. Tunde Folawiyo, CEO of Yinka Folawiyo Group, focuses on technological advancements to stay competitive and agile. Albert Essien, former CEO of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated, championed the adoption of digital banking solutions to reach unbanked populations and improve financial inclusion. Moses Baiden, CEO of Margins Group in Ghana, is another notable leader who prioritizes innovation, particularly in the fields of secure identity solutions and digital transformation, to propel his company forward.




Execution of Strategic Priorities


1. Resource Allocation:


Effective execution of strategic priorities requires prudent allocation of resources, including financial, human, and technological assets. CEOs must ensure that resources are directed toward high-impact areas that align with their strategic goals. This often involves making tough decisions and reallocating resources from underperforming segments to more promising initiatives. For example, Kelvin Doe, CEO of the Rising Academies Network in Ghana, strategically allocates resources to expand educational opportunities and improve learning outcomes across the region. Rayan Sharara, CEO of Orca Decor Ghana, is known for his strategic allocation of resources to optimize operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction, ensuring the company remains competitive in the decor industry.


2. Building a High-Performance Culture:




A high-performance culture is essential for executing strategic priorities. CEOs must foster an environment that encourages innovation, accountability, and continuous improvement. This involves setting clear performance expectations, providing regular feedback, and recognizing and rewarding high achievers. Fred Swaniker, CEO of the African Leadership Group, emphasizes building a culture of excellence to drive the execution of his organization’s strategic priorities. In Ghana, Nana Kwame Bediako, CEO of Kwarleyz Group, is known for cultivating a high-performance culture that values creativity and innovation. Hayssam Fakhry, CEO of Interplast, also prioritizes building a high-performance culture, emphasizing continuous training, and development to enhance employee capabilities and drive company success.


3. Risk Management and Adaptability: 


In the volatile business environment of Ghana and Africa, risk management and adaptability are critical for successful execution. CEOs must develop robust risk management frameworks to identify, assess, and mitigate risks. Additionally, they must remain adaptable, ready to pivot their strategies in response to changing circumstances. Njeri Rionge, CEO of Ignite Consulting, highlights the importance of agility in responding to market disruptions and emerging opportunities. Kenneth Thompson, CEO of Dalex Finance in Ghana, emphasizes proactive risk management and adaptability in navigating the financial services sector. Mansa Nettey, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Ghana, exemplifies these qualities by implementing comprehensive risk management practices and maintaining strategic flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing financial landscape.


4. Performance Monitoring and Evaluation: 




Continuous monitoring and evaluation of performance are vital for ensuring that strategic priorities are being effectively executed. CEOs must establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly review progress against these metrics. This allows them to identify areas for improvement, make necessary adjustments, and ensure accountability across the organization. Kojo Annan, CEO of Africa10, underscores the importance of rigorous performance monitoring to drive the success of his sports and entertainment ventures in Africa. Julian Opuni, CEO of Fidelity Bank Ghana, is renowned for his meticulous performance monitoring systems that ensure the bank meets its strategic goals and maintains its competitive edge.


Conclusion


The priority-setting strategies and executions of Ghanaian and African CEOs are characterized by visionary leadership, stakeholder engagement, market insight, and a strong emphasis on innovation. By effectively setting and executing strategic priorities, these leaders drive their organizations toward sustainable growth and resilience in the face of regional and global challenges. As the business landscape continues to evolve, the adaptability and strategic acumen of these CEOs will be crucial in navigating the complexities and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead.

Enhancing climate resource mobilisation: A key strategy for addressing Ghanas nationally determined contributions,"The escalating impacts of climate change present a substantial risk to the global ecosystem and nations worldwide are compelled to enhance their commitment to environmental sustainability. 


Acknowledging the urgency of the issue, countries have pledged to address climate change under the Paris Agreement, establishing specific goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 


A crucial element of this commitment is bolstering the mobilisation of climate resources, a strategy that transcends national borders and aligns closely with domestic development objectives.


Ghana, navigating the complex terrain of climate action, takes a leading role in addressing its NDCs, striving to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance resilience. 


However, like many nations, Ghana faces challenges in fulfilling its NDCs. Climate finance is essential to support climate-related projects, encompassing adaptation and mitigation strategies. 




The global community, as highlighted by the Paris Agreement, emphasises the importance of financial support to help vulnerable developing nations achieve their climate objectives. 


As such, enhancing climate resource mobilisation is crucial for the effective execution of Ghana's climate action plan.


Challenges in Enhancing Climate Resource Mobilisation in Ghana


Ghana's NDCs outline ambitious objectives, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, bolstering resilience, and transitioning to a low-carbon economy. 




Achieving these goals heavily depends on the availability of financial resources. Ghana, like many developing nations, faces several challenges in enhancing climate resource mobilisation, such as securing funds for climate initiatives amid economic constraints and competing development priorities. Economic constraints and developmental priorities also pose significant obstacles to allocating sufficient resources for climate action. 


Additionally, reliance on traditional financing sources limits the execution of transformative projects crucial for sustainable development. The nascent green finance sector in Ghana, coupled with a lack of awareness among stakeholders, further complicates progress. 


Ghana's vulnerability to climate impacts, evident in erratic weather patterns and agricultural disruptions, underscores the urgent need for financial resources. 


Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive strategies to ensure a resilient and sustainable future.




Strategies to Enhance Climate Resource Mobilisation in Ghana


In its quest to enhance climate resource mobilisation and achieve its NDCs, Ghana recognises the need for substantial financial support to implement sustainable initiatives effectively. 


This strategic imperative aims to harmonise environmental stewardship with socio-economic development. Among the strategies that can lead to the realisation of the country’s efforts to domestically mobilise climate finance include:



Strengthening domestic funding mechanisms: emphasising domestic resource mobilisation, Ghana should explore innovative financing mechanisms like green bonds, climate taxes, and earmarked funds. This would establish a reliable and consistent flow of funds dedicated to climate initiatives.




Private sector engagement: engaging the private sector is crucial for advancing climate resource mobilisation. Investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly infrastructure can aid in achieving NDC targets while stimulating economic growth. Public-private partnerships can unlock the private sector's potential to support Ghana's climate agenda.




International collaboration: Ghana should strengthen its partnerships with international partners and global climate funds like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to accelerate the access to vital financial support for large-scale projects. Advocating for increased contributions from developed nations is also essential.




Capacity building and knowledge transfer: developing institutional capacity and facilitating knowledge transfer are vital for effective climate resource mobilisation. Resources should be allocated to training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives to empower local communities, government agencies, and businesses in adopting sustainable practices.




Climate-inclusive financial policies: aligning financial policies with climate goals is imperative. Integrating climate considerations into budgeting processes and ensuring that funds allocated are disbursed is critical to projects contributing to objectives NDCs. This approach creates a conducive environment for sustainable investments.



Policy implications for enhancing climate resource mobilisation in Ghana




Implementing the above strategies requires a coordinated effort among government bodies, regulatory agencies, and stakeholders. 


Regular reviews and adjustments are necessary to adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities in climate resource mobilisation. 


By incorporating the relevant policies into the national agenda, Ghana can foster a conducive environment for sustainable development while addressing its climate commitments.


Ghana stands at the forefront of a crucial mission to enhance climate resource mobilisation. 




Climate finance, as a strategic imperative, harmonises environmental stewardship with socio-economic development and the efficient utilisation of climate finance is key to pushing Ghana towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future.


The outlined following policy implications serve as a guide for various stakeholders, necessitating a collective effort and adaptability to evolving climate challenges:



The government should enact policies that incentivise domestic funding mechanisms such as green bonds, climate taxes, and earmarked funds. Regulations should be introduced to ensure transparency and accountability in resource allocation, while tax incentives or subsidies for businesses investing in sustainable practices should be explored to encourage active participation in climate initiatives.


Encourage private sector engagement in climate-related projects and supportive policy environment should be established to include creating financial incentives, simplifying regulatory processes, and providing grants or subsidies for businesses committed to sustainability. Developing clear frameworks for public-private partnerships will facilitate collaboration and shared responsibilities, ensuring a concerted effort towards achieving climate goals.


Enhancing policies to promote international collaboration and engagements in global climate finance mechanisms and advocating for increased contributions from developed nations to international climate funds. This would require developing clear guidelines for accessing and utilising these funds, ensuring alignment with national priorities, and establishing transparent reporting and accountability mechanisms.


Prioritise capacity building and knowledge transfer by implementing policies across government agencies, local communities, and businesses. This includes integrating climate education into the national curriculum to raise early awareness and expertise as well as establishing training programs, workshops, and knowledge-sharing platforms to equip stakeholders with essential skills for effective climate action.



Conclusion Enhancing climate resource mobilisation is a national obligation and a commitment to global well-being. Through a comprehensive strategy encompassing domestic innovation, private sector synergy, international collaboration, knowledge empowerment, and climate-inclusive financial policies, Ghana can lead the charge towards a sustainable and resilient future. 


As outgoing President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Ghana’s inspiring example for nations worldwide has reinforced the collective resolve in the global fight against climate change. 




The path forward beckons, and Ghana stands poised to make a significant impact on climate change and sustainable development.

A review of Dr Mahamudu Bawumias vision for Ghana  A gender perspective,"Introduction


In his 73-page presentation, His Excellency Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, the Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana who is also the flagbearer of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) outlined his vision, touching on some policies that he hopes to implement if elected President of Ghana in the December 2024 polls.


The much-anticipated speech was eloquently delivered on the 7th of February 2024 at the Accra campus of the University of Professional Studies (UPSA)’s Kofi Ohene Konadu Auditorium on the theme “Ghana’s Next Chapter: Selfless Leadership and Bold Solutions for the Future.”


The speech addressed a wide range of issues, cutting across the nation’s socio-political, economic and cultural fibre. The Vice President’s speech shed light on assignments he had spearheaded in the NPP government (including some 32 new policies); significant collective achievements of the ruling NPP government; and the need for continuity and building on the Akufo-Addo legacy. He also touched on some policy departures and repositioning, and the new ideas and policies he intended to bring on board – christened “Bold Solutions”.


In paragraph 110 of the speech, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia encapsulated the entirety of his vision vividly as follows: My vision is to create a tent big enough to accommodate all our people, to tap into the resourcefulness and talents of our people irrespective of our different ethnic, political and religious backgrounds, to channel our energies into building the kind of country that assures a food self-sufficient, safe, prosperous, and dignified future for all Ghanaians, to create sustainable jobs with meaningful pay for all, and for Ghana to participate fully in the fourth industrial revolution using systems and data.




As a core advocate for the advancement of women, children and the vulnerable in society, and a United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) Goodwill Ambassador to Ghana, I have passionately taken time to review the vision and policy direction of Dr. Bawumia in line with driving the economic and social growth of Ghana. In this article, however, my objective is to highlight and appraise Dr. Bawumia’s policies that are geared towards women and children while paying general attention to the overall well-being of the ordinary Ghanaian and the vulnerable in our society.


In this short piece, I seek to highlight some of the policy prescriptions as outlined by H.E. Dr Mahamudu Bawumia from a gender perspective. I will employ the skills of using compelling comparative analyses and citing examples of best practices around the world in reviewing how Bawumia’s “Bold Solutions” will impact the next chapter of Ghana’s quest for sustained development going into the second quarter of the 21st Century.



Education






Dr Bawumia indicated that he would enhance and reposition the education sector to cope with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This repositioning according to him, will prioritise Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Vocational Skills for innovation and job creation.


The much-anticipated speech on page 50, paragraph 129 summed up the vision for education: ""I will enhance the repositioning of the education system towards STEM, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and vocational skills to cope with the demands of the fourth Industrial Revolution.""




Current data has it that, women occupy only 25% of all jobs in STEM in Ghana, while the remainder 75% are held by men. In the US, women hold 27% of jobs in the STEM industry. Globally women made up 29% of the STEM workforce (Global Gender Gap Report, 2023). Looking at the statistics across the world, Ghana is not so different from the reality of the global gender disparity; however much more needs to be done.


Currently, there are seven STEM schools that are fully operational under the Free-SHS policy across the country. This initiative, which was launched by the current government, has significantly increased the enrolment of the girl-child in beneficiary Senior High Schools (SHS). It has also led to the establishment of iconic all-girls STEM Schools across the country.


 In addition to this, there are other gender-based education programmes already in progress that are focused on IT, such as Girls in ICT, Youth in IT, She Can Code, and Free Wi-Fi Connection for senior high schools, among others. 


By implementing these policies, which are deliberately targeted at closing the gender gap and bridging the digital divide, Ghana is set to achieve gender parity in education (especially in STEM, including Vocational and Technical Education) and in IT in just under a decade. The future looks bright for Ghana with a positive outlook in achieving its goals.




In Dr Bawumia's own words: ""As part of this process it is my goal to eliminate the digital divide by achieving close to 100% internet penetration. We have already made very significant progress in this direction by increasing internet penetration from 34% in 2016 to 72% in 2023 (by more than double!!!). The task in the next four years is to move from 72% to close to 100%! It is possible!""   


In respect of vocational and technical skills training and acquisition, the address envisioned ""A growth mindset curriculum to help students build critical skills such as problem-solving, risk-taking, opportunity spotting, and design thinking.""


Out of the 18,432 technical training institute trainees in the country, only 16% are women while at the National Vocational Training Institutes (NVTI), 26% of the 6,710 trainees are women. Even though there have been conscious efforts by individuals and organisations to bring more women into the field of STEM and Technical/Vocational training, the statistics show a clear underrepresentation of females.


It is therefore imperative to use multidimensional strategies to bring women and girls on board as Dr Bawumia envisions thus: ""Generally, there will be an enhanced focus on TVET education. My government will also support the establishment of a National Open University Ghana in collaboration with the private sector with a focus on Technical and vocational skills and ICT.""




""I want to see Ghana build the digital talent we require for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This will mean providing digital and software skills to hundreds of thousands of youths. This along with other policies, will create jobs for the youth, including school dropouts.


 In collaboration with the private sector, we will train at least 1,000,000 youth in IT skills, including software developers to provide job opportunities worldwide...My government would make coding and robotics standard in senior high school"" he added.


In the areas of higher learning, the speech categorically captured a very important issue in medicine and legal professional training which has generated public debate in recent years. The vision intends to ""...expand infrastructure at medical schools as well as the Ghana Law School to support an increase in admission for students for medical and legal studies."" Although not expressly stated, I strongly believe this will also be a win for females in the specialised fields of medicine and law. 


In this regard, I humbly submit that in the preparation towards rolling out such a laudable vision, much effort and attractive incentives should be geared towards closing the gender gap and being considerate towards the vulnerable in society, especially People Living with Disabilities (PLWDs) – for without these considerations, we are not building an all-inclusive society.  





Affirmative Action



Affirmative Action is one of the most definite ways of ensuring gender parity and adequate female representation in any country's decision-making space and nation-building process. There are examples of how impactful it has been in other African countries such as Rwanda, Guinea, Kenya, and Senegal, among others.


Dr. Bawumia’s vision prioritizes the full implementation of the Affirmative Action Act once the Bill is enacted into law. Paragraph 167 of the address captures this thus ""A Bawumia administration will prioritise the full implementation of the Affirmative Action Act as should hopefully have been passed by January 2025"".


The Affirmative Action Bill in Ghana aims to tackle the long-standing problem of discrimination and exclusion of women. If passed into law, it will ensure a critical number of women hold key positions in governance, public life, and decision-making spaces. 


The Bill defines Affirmative Action as ""a set of measures adopted by the government, public and private institutions to address a history of systemic discrimination and exclusion of women."" The Bill's primary purpose is to encourage gender balance in political, social, cultural, economic, and educational sectors. 




By 2030, the goal is to increase the active participation of women in public life from a minimum of 40% to parity (50%), aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).


The Affirmative Action Bill has faced challenges for some 24 years now, and still hasn't been passed into law. This makes it one of the longest-pending Bills in Ghana's legislative history. One of the main reasons for this delay is the lack of commitment and political will. 


It is therefore refreshing to hear that the Executive arm of the government will be championing this Bill to pass into law. Since it's a government agenda, I believe it should be given the prominence and urgency it deserves and receive the needed attention to hopefully pass into law by 2025, as stated in the address.


There is no exaggeration that the Affirmative Action Bill holds the promise to empower women and achieve greater gender parity in Ghana's governance and leadership roles. This will promote inclusivity and harness our nation-building efforts for national development. 




Rwanda, for instance, currently ranks as the first country in the world with a female majority in its Parliament with women making up about 61.3% in the Chamber of Deputies (one of two Chambers of Parliament). This feat was attained by the country through the prioritisation of the inclusion of women in their structures and processes. In 2003, the Constitution of Rwanda was amended and it included a quota system for women at all levels of government. 


A 30% quota of all representatives was reserved for women including those in Parliament. Rwanda’s quota is different from majority systems in the world, in the sense that, the quota is not exclusively reserved for women candidates but also reserves a minimum number of seats for women (often known as Equality of Result quotas). It allows for only women to be the voters for the women-only seats.


In 2010, Senegal also adopted a gender parity law, through the establishment of a 50/50 quota called Law of Parity. It provides that all political parties are to nominate an equal number of women and men on their party lists as constituency candidates. Parties are not allowed to run elections if they fail to achieve gender parity in respect of candidate lists. 


The initiative brought about a rise in women representatives in the National Assembly from 22.7% to 42.7% in 2012. In the local legislatures, there was also an increase in female representatives from 16% to 47% in the 2014 local elections.


The experiences of Rwanda and Senegal provides concrete evidence that affirmative action is one sure way to get more women involved in political leadership and the decision-making process.


 By prioritising the full implementation of the policy objectives of the Affirmative Action Bill once it is passed into law, the governance structure and system under Dr Bawumia as President will attract more qualified and competent Ghanaian women in politics and leadership positions in all facets of our society by statutory prescription. This will be a great leap towards gender parity in no uncertain terms. 



Individualised Credit Scoring System                                                  



An individualised credit scoring system is a statistical analysis used by financial institutions and lenders to assess a borrower's creditworthiness. Dr Bawumia's vision for Ghana makes mention of introducing a credit scoring system. In his own words, he stressed that ""It is my goal to make it easier and cheaper to access credit by leveraging on our data and systems such as Ghanacard, GhanapostGPS, Mobile Money Interoperability, DVLA, GRA, Bank Accounts, etc. to build an efficient credit system and mortgage market in Ghana underpinned by individualised credit scoring and the digitalisation of land titling and transfer. We look forward to starting individualised credit scoring in Ghana this year and this will make it easier for Ghanaians to access credit at lower interest rates.""


According to the Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs in 2021, Ghana has the third highest proportion of women business owners in Africa (after Botswana and Uganda). However, most of these businesses are small-scale businesses with minimum capital to start up.


From the foregoing, women entrepreneurs stand to benefit more than any group of people from Dr Bawumia's vision of Individualised Credit Scoring once it is introduced in Ghana.


According to statistics from the Ghana Enterprise Agency (a government-owned organization that administers small business credit schemes), 60% of the over 700,000 applicants of a loan scheme at one point in time were women. 


Despite several efforts by the government and its development partners to support small to medium-scale enterprises to acquire credit, there is no scientific data on individualised credit scorecards to ascertain person-to-person creditworthiness. 


Consequently, time and again, the one-size-fits-all approach has proven not to be very effective and reliable. In the absence of any such data, small to medium-sized business owners tend to lose more. They are often undervalued and lose 40% of the total value they could have acquired as loans due to their perceived high level of risk.


An example of a similar challenge was witnessed when the Development Bank of Ghana (DBG) launched a scheme to lend $600 million to small businesses to help in their business expansion. It turned out that women still had limited access in securing these loans due to the overly complicated procedures and interest rates on these loans.


With the introduction of the individualized credit scoring system, an individual’s credit score can determine the maximum loan amount they can borrow with lower interest rates. This will greatly help women business owners seek the appropriate amount of loans, they need to enhance their businesses. After all, the majority of Ghana’s small-medium scale business owners are women.



Flat Tax Regime                                                                                                 



Dr Bawumia's vision for Ghana also includes a proposal for a flat tax regime where all taxpayers will pay a percentage of their income regardless of how much money they earn. This taxation regime is not only fair in creating a level playing field but also comes with ""appropriate exemption thresholds to protect the poor"" and vulnerable. Such a tax rate does not change as one’s income increases or decreases, yet the absolute amount of tax will increase as one’s income increases.


""My administration will introduce a very simple, citizen and business-friendly flat tax regime. A flat tax of a percentage of income for individuals and SMEs (which constitute 98% of all businesses in Ghana) with appropriate exemption thresholds set to protect the poor"" the address stated.


Mauritius has a flat tax rate on individual income of 15%, with a reduced rate of 10% for individuals who earn less than MUR 650,000 annually. The same rate applies to corporate and interest income, making the tax regime extremely simple. This increases compliance and reduces tax evasion as one cannot structure one’s taxes to reduce it. 


The country also has zero capital gains tax, no dividend withholding tax, and no inheritance or estate tax. Mauritius has therefore become a very attractive destination for foreign investors and businesses, ranking first in Africa for ease of doing business and 20th in the world.


According to the audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Mauritius’ tax system has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa’s highest per capita incomes. The country has developed from a low-income, agricultural economy into a middle-income, diversified economy with burgeoning tourism, textile, and financial services sectors.


Mauritius has managed to grow its economy at over 5% per annum, reducing income inequality, improving life expectancy, and reducing infant mortality. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Mauritius was over $400 million in 2022, with a  share of GDP growing to 18.7%.


The introduction of such a tax system in Ghana will help stabilise the daily businesses of  SMEs, ease the burden of doing business, increase tax compliance, rake in more revenue for the government and help expand the much-talked-about narrow tax net. 


From a gender point of view, since the majority of small-scale businesses are owned by women in Ghana, this single initiative will be a financial backbone for a lot of women entrepreneurs to thrive in business, and more so, enhance their creditworthiness thereby expanding their businesses. 


Obviously, this vision has the informal sector, small/medium-scale enterprises, low to middle-income families, and most importantly, women and children at heart. 



Housing                                                                                                   



Under ""A Housing for All policy"", a future President Bawumia intends to focus on the provision of public housing in the same manner that Singapore did. The vision plans to partner with the private sector (Public Private Partnership) to build large housing estates to provide decent accommodation for Ghanaians. Also, the National Rental Assistance scheme will be enhanced to deal with the problem of demands for rent advance.


The National Rental Assistance Scheme launched in January 2023 by Vice President Bawumia pays rent advance for qualified applicants who are in the process of renewing or renting a room, an apartment or a complete house. Their services allow renters to make monthly affordable rent payments.


At present, more than 1,100 Ghanaians are benefiting from a scheme that helps to reduce their rental burden on a daily basis. If this policy is further enhanced, it will provide significant relief to ordinary Ghanaians, particularly mothers with low incomes who struggle to support their families.


Ghana's housing deficit has witnessed a 33% reduction since the year 2000 (Ghana Statistical Survey, 2021). This achievement is attributed to factors such as the real estate interventions and the over 70% increase in residential structures within the period. Despite this progress, current statistics estimate Ghana's housing deficit is around 1.8 million.


Public-private partnerships (PPP), as a mechanism for constructing and maintaining low-income housing, is a tried and tested initiative with great success in countries including the United States, Australia, Ireland and the UK to mention a few.


Public-private partnership is being used as one of the globally accepted potent options to leverage the strength, skill and resources of the private sector in bringing efficiencies and cost-effectiveness in building and creating housing for the masses. In this system, unlike the standalone pattern, both private and public sectors remain active partners in creating housing. In the standalone case, only the private sector remains an active partner. In contrast, the role and involvement of the public sector remains passive, in the form of creating an enabling and supportive environment, for facilitating the efficient operation and functioning of the private sector.


The implementation of Private-Public Partnerships in the provision of affordable housing will lessen the pressure on the government while guaranteeing that many Ghanaians who are limited in financial resources have decent and affordable housing. Among the almost 2 million Ghanaians without decent and affordable housing, most of the victims are women and children. An example is the ‘kayeyei’ menace in major towns and cities across the country which comprises young girls and women (many of them with children) who are homeless at market centers where they ply their head-porter trade. 


In other instances, there are housing facilities available alright but the expensive cost of rent renders willing renters homeless or at best living in makeshift structures resulting in the development of slums and shanty towns. In this case, the National Rental Scheme comes to the aid of those who cannot raise the money upfront to pay rent advance.


Private developers have done a lot over the years to reduce the deficit with little or no government support. Therefore, the PPP arrangement in addressing the housing challenge as envisioned by Dr Bawumia is not only very laudable but also timely in taking a bold step to confront the issue of homelessness and the provision of decent homes for Ghanaian families.



Care for the Vulnerable and Persons with Special Needs                              



The importance of Speech therapy expansion and occupational and behavioural therapy features greatly in the vision Dr Bawumia. As he put it:


""I want to build a nation that cares for and invests in the vulnerable like persons with disabilities, the aged, street kids, lepers, cerebral palsy patients, etc. in cooperation with faith-based institutions and the private sector.


""My government will also focus on special needs. To start with, we will recruit 1,000 special education teachers and retrain teachers on how to work with special needs students. We will also train more speech and language therapists and occupational and behavioural therapists""


Speech therapy tends to offer numerous benefits, including improved articulation, enhanced language abilities, better fluency, and more effective social communication skills. It empowers children to express themselves more clearly, understand others, and participate more fully in social and academic settings.


Demographic information on Speech-language pathologists in the United States indicates that the workforce of Speech-language pathologists in 2021 was 169,894 people, with 95.2% women and 4.76% men. Ghana’s populations stand at about 32 million people with approximately 50 Speech/Language Pathologists and most of them are located in the capital city, Accra.


The implementation of such a policy to train more speech and language therapists as well as occupational and behavioural therapists will help invest in the quality of lives of citizens across all 16 regions, who need such services and also help create jobs for individuals who specialize in those fields.


The Special Education Division of the Ghana Education Service is responsible for promoting inclusive education policies that align with Goal #4 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This goal aims to bring together all categories of learners, including those with disabilities, and provide them with a safe and conducive environment for teaching and learning.


Comparing statistics in Ghana over eleven years (2010-2021) show a very worrying trend. During the 2010 Population and Housing Census, data captured indicated that about 623,500 children of primary school age were still not registered in schools and one out of every four children in the kindergarten age group (four to five years) was not enrolled in a pre-school. 


Furthermore, 20% of children with physical disabilities did not attend school. In addition, four out of ten Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) aged three and above have received no formal education, while only 17.4% have completed basic school.


According to the 2021 population and housing census data, 1,215,546 Ghanaian children between the ages of four and 17 are not currently attending school. Shockingly, almost one million of these children have never had the opportunity to attend school.


Denying access to education for children with disabilities leads to social isolation and marginalisation, as they are denied suitable career opportunities later in life due to their lower level of skills.


The implementation of a programme to recruit 1,000 special education teachers for starters under Dr Bawumia’s presidency will help safeguard the future of our children with special needs and at the same time sharpen their talents and skills for the greater good of the country as a whole.


Conclusion


Dr Mahamudu Bawumia's vision for Ghana as President clearly empowers women, supports children and aids the vulnerable in the society. By aggressively pursuing a gender-based action Bill; recalibrating education to embrace the fourth industrial era and using a collective approach to build an all-inclusive society, these ""Bold Solutions"" come to raise the bar in setting new standards in Ghana's politics of issues.


The passage of the Affirmative Action Bill into law, however becomes the linchpin of the gender agenda of the next NPP government. Collectively, these beautiful ideas and sound principles need the support of all well-meaning Ghanaians with that optimistic spirit – It Is Possible!

Steering through change: The role of interim leadership during CEO transitions,"The transition of a CEO marks a pivotal moment for any organisation. Such periods are often characterised by a significant leadership vacuum and accompanied by a sense of uncertainty. This period of change can challenge the very fabric of an organisation, testing its resilience and operational continuity. Interim leadership during this period plays a crucial role in ensuring stability, and operational continuity and preparing the organisation for its next horizon.


This article explores the crucial role that interim leadership plays in times of transition. It examines the difficulties and recommended approaches when taking on the role of an interim leader, while also setting the groundwork for the organisation’s future with new permanent leadership.


The Role of Interim Leadership


Ensuring Stability, Strategic and Execution Continuity


The primary responsibility of an interim CEO is to maintain stability and ensure that the organisation continues to operate smoothly during the transitional period. This critical role involves overseeing ongoing operations, maintaining employee morale, and managing stakeholder relationships to reassure all parties that the business remains in capable hands. Interim leaders act as a bridge during executive transitions, providing a steady hand that helps mitigate potential instability. They address immediate concerns, manage crises, and ensure that the company maintains its momentum.


Maintaining Strategic Focus


While the tenure of an interim leader is inherently temporary, it is essential that the organisation does not deviate from its strategic objectives. The interim leader must uphold and maintain the strategic direction, focusing on ensuring that ongoing projects and key strategic initiatives continue without disruption. They should also possess the flexibility to adapt strategies as the situation demands, aligning short-term actions with long-term goals.


Preparing for Transition to a Substantive CEO


The interim leader also lays the groundwork for a seamless transition to a substantive CEO, relaying key institutional knowledge and insights on contemporary issues. This preparation involves assessing the organisation’s current state and creating an environment conducive to identifying critical challenges and opportunities, which will facilitate a smooth transition. The proactive steps taken during this phase are crucial for the incoming CEO to inherit a stable and strategically aligned organization.




Challenges and Solutions in Interim Leadership


While the roles of interim leadership are clear and crucial for maintaining organizational stability and strategic focus, fulfilling these responsibilities is not without its challenges. Let us explore the common obstacles interim leaders encounter and the effective solutions to overcome these hurdles, ensuring a successful transition period.


Resistance to Change


One of the most significant challenges an interim leader may encounter is resistance from employees and stakeholders who may be wary of transitional leadership. To mitigate this, the interim CEO should engage in active listening, address concerns directly, and foster an inclusive environment. Building trust through transparency and regular communication helps align all parties with the interim leader’s objectives.


Maintaining Organizational Momentum


Maintaining momentum during a transition can be challenging, especially when critical projects need to continue without disruption. Interim leaders must prioritize key initiatives, ensuring that these projects do not stall. Regular updates and strategic focus sessions can help keep these initiatives on track and maintain the organization’s progress.


Balancing Continuity and Change


While it’s crucial to maintain continuity, interim leaders must also be open to necessary changes that may be required for the organization’s success. This balancing act requires nuanced judgment and a strategic approach to ensure stability while still adapting to evolving organizational needs.




Aligning with Board Expectations


Ensuring that decisions and actions align with the board’s expectations is critical. Regular meetings and strategic alignment sessions with the board can facilitate this, ensuring that the interim leadership’s actions are in sync with the organization’s long-term goals.


Best Practices for Effective Interim Leadership


Next, we will explore the key strategies that help maintain leadership effectiveness and organizational integrity during transitional periods.


Early Planning


Ideally, succession planning should begin well before a CEO’s departure. Proactive identification of potential interim leaders and preparing them for their roles can significantly smooth the transition process. Early planning allows the interim leader to familiarise themselves with the organisation’s strategic objectives and operational nuances, ensuring they are well-prepared to steer the ship during this transitional phase.


Clear Mandate


The interim CEO should clearly understand their responsibilities, authority, and the duration of their tenure. A well-defined mandate helps to avoid confusion and ensures that the interim leadership can act decisively and with focused authority. Establishing these boundaries and expectations upfront is critical to maintaining organisational alignment and efficacy.




Support Systems


To be effective, interim leadership must be heavily supported by robust systems, including access to necessary resources, critical information, and the cooperation of senior management. The backing of the previous CEO during the handing over process can also be crucial for the interim leader’s effectiveness. Ensuring that the interim CEO has these support systems in place facilitates their ability to manage the organisation confidently and competently.


Seamless Transition


The interim CEO plays a pivotal role in preparing for the seamless transition to a substantive CEO. This preparation may involve regular interactions with the board, joint meetings, shared briefings, and collaborative planning. Such efforts ensure that the incoming CEO can integrate smoothly and continue to drive the organisation forward without disruption.


Characteristics of an Effective Interim Leader


It is important to grasp the best practices outlined above for effective interim leadership. However, it is equally vital to develop the key qualities that set apart an effective interim CEO. Let us now look at the important qualities that help leaders thrive during times of transition.


Experienced and Adaptable


An effective interim CEO should have significant leadership experience and a proven ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Their ability to quickly grasp the organisation’s dynamics and make informed decisions is critical for navigating the transitional period successfully. This adaptability allows them to respond effectively to unexpected challenges and opportunities, maintaining the organisation’s stability and progress.




Strong Communicator


Clear, transparent, consistent, and effective communication is vital during a transition. The interim leader must keep all stakeholders informed, addressing any concerns promptly and providing reassurance. This includes managing communications with employees, shareholders, customers, and other external stakeholders to ensure that everyone remains aligned with the organisation’s current state and future direction.


Objective and Decisive


An interim leader should be impartial and objective, allowing them to make unbiased, timely decisions that are in the best interest of the organisation. Their decisiveness provides clear direction to the organisation during a potentially uncertain time and is crucial for keeping the organisation on track. The ability to make necessary decisions without hesitation supports the continuity of operations and strategic initiatives.


Interim leadership during a CEO transition is a critical component of organisational resilience. By selecting the right interim leader, planning meticulously, and ensuring robust support and communication, organisations can navigate this period smoothly, maintaining continuity and stability. An effective interim leader bridges the leadership vacuum and sets the stage for the substantive CEO to thrive and lead the organisation to new heights.


Ultimately, effective interim leadership does not merely fill a temporary gap; it enhances the organisation’s capacity for a smooth and successful transition. This leadership period is an opportunity to reinforce the organisation’s strategic directions, instil confidence among stakeholders, and ensure a robust framework for the incoming CEO, contributing to the overall health and growth of the organisation post-transition.

Coming out of the hotels  Elizabeth Ohene writes,"When it comes to what subjects I write on in my column, it is often as the spirit moves me, always with the understanding that I am not the type of person to write on Ian Smith and Rhodesia on the day that three former heads of state are executed in Ghana.


Sometimes I do choose to wait out the noise on some subjects and then get onto it when I can see a different path from what had been trodden bare.


Four Mondays ago, I sent this message to the Editor of the Graphic: “I’m unable to write a column this week. All my instincts are to write about the brouhaha that has started about SSNIT and the hotels.


Since I chair the SSNIT Board, I feel inhibited, not because I have nothing to say but because I am not clear in my mind about the rules and conventions on going public with Board matters.


But then, I also don’t really want to write about any other subject and give the impression I am running away from the subject that is dominating discussions. So, I am afraid I am not offering a column this week.”




I have now gone for three weeks without offering any script for the column, and I am thinking that my continuing silence might be interpreted as disrespect or guilt of whatever I am being accused of.


Plus, last Friday, I went to the launch of a book, written by one of my favourite people and I really want to write about the book, and I can hardly launch myself back into the column without addressing the subject matter that took me off in the first place. So, here goes.


When the Board I chair was inaugurated in August 2021, the Director-General I met often said that SSNIT was like the Black Stars in the sentiments of Ghanaians, all 34 million of us have a view on it and with SSNIT, he thought the widespread interest was legitimate because even if you don’t contribute to the scheme yourself, your uncle, or niece or friend does and their tomorrows are at stake. We both agreed that pension funds are sacred. 


Front page


My constant refrain with my Board of Trustees is we should have at the back of our minds that every step we take and every decision we make, could end up on the front page of the Daily Graphic and we should be comfortable with the ensuing headline. I would then add my own personal credo that I had brought with me to the Board.




We met lots of outstanding matters that had been unresolved for years. I announced at every opportunity that I was not prepared to kick any problem down the road for the next set of people to resolve.


We would take decisions and try to resolve issues that come up. Maybe we would make some mistakes and if that is shown up, I would take responsibility, but I would not be paralysed into inaction by the fear of displeasing some people.


I did not imagine that my theories would be played out so graphically and tested in real time so soon. I am afraid I have not followed, as keenly as I should have, the discussions that have been going on since the Honourable Member for North Tongu started his campaign against what he has variously described as the SSNIT Board and management’s disregard for due process, abuse of power, corruption, lack of transparency, deception, procurement breaches etc. etc. etc.


From what I can work out, there are a number of issues that are being raised about the decision to divest a 60 per cent stake in the shares of the six hotels owned by SSNIT: an ideological resistance to the idea of divesting shares in the hotels to a strategic investor, especially since some of the hotels are said to be profitable; the process through which the preferred bidder, Rock City Limited, was chosen, was corrupt; the owner of Rock City, Bryan Acheampong, is a Minister of State and should therefore not be able to bid for a state asset.




There are other side issues that come up depending on who is talking and the person’s individual idiosyncrasies. I will not try to lay out the arguments here for the need to divest shares in the ownership of the hotels, I will simply say that I was persuaded by the decision that the SSNIT Board had taken back in 2018 and I determined to make it a reality.


I am able to say with the utmost certainty that the process that led to the selection of Rock City as the Preferred Bidder was clean, above board and met every rule and regulation and can withstand every scrutiny.


Mr Okudzeto Ablakwa claims to have God and Ghana on the side of his campaign, and I would hope all of God’s Angels and Ghana’s investigative agencies, temporal and spiritual, would examine the process and tell the world if they find any irregularity or trace of corrupt practice. Indeed, if they should find any evidence of corruption, I will assume and accept responsibility and expect to be prosecuted.


Political colouration


I accept that this being an election year, everything takes on a political colouration and Bryan Acheampong being the owner of Rock City is obviously the main reason the decibel level of the discussions has gone so high.




By all means, let us have a discussion about a company belonging to a Minister of State winning an open, competitive bid, no matter how fairly; but surely that is a different argument from whether SSNIT can, or is allowed to find private sector investment for its hotels and any of its other wholly or majority-owned investments.      


Quite a number of things baffle me, but I will mention two: the suggestion that this was some secret thing being done that has been discovered and the sordid details are being exposed by a Member of Parliament and secondly, the suggestion that the President of the Republic, and by extension, the government took the decision and was in some way, in charge of the divestiture process of the shares in the hotels owned by SSNIT.


If you want to do something in secret, it would be very strange to announce your intentions with advertisements in the Daily Graphic, the Ghanaian Times and the Economist. And yet, that is exactly what SSNIT did when its Board of Trustees took the decision to seek a strategic investor to take a 60 per cent stake in the six hotels it owns.


The advertisements were followed by various public statements by SSNIT executives at various stages, once the process got going. Indeed, the last two times that SSNIT appeared before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, the subject of trying to find a strategic investor in the hotels came up and SSNIT was urged to hurry with the process and conclude what it was doing. 




Strategic investor


So, one can safely say that some people in Parliament, at the very least, the members of the Public Accounts Committee were aware that SSNIT was seeking to divest 60 per cent of its stake in the hotels and the members did not sound like they thought it was such a terrible idea, nor that something untoward was going on.


Suddenly, Ghanaians are being urged to think and believe that getting a strategic investor to take a stake in the hotels amounts to a sordid crime. I am at a total loss to understand how the President and the government got into this.


Mr Okudzeto Ablakwa appears to know something I don’t. The Board of Trustees certainly did not go to get permission or even inform the President of the Republic or any Minister about the decision to seek a strategic investor to take a stake in the hotels.


The Board did not need such permission, was not obliged to inform the government and did not do so. I have seen no evidence in the records of past Boards going to the government or the President to get permission to make an investment decision.




The Board did not involve the President, nor the Minister, nor the government in the process. The Act that governs SSNIT makes no such provision and I had thought it was in everyone’s interest that the pension fund is kept away from government interference.


Obviously, a demonstration is more sexy when it ends at Jubilee House, but I assure the Honourable Member for North Tongu he was out by a long shot.

Williams Kwasi Peprah: The 37% haircut on Eurobond not saved but a debt forgiveness,"It is crucial for Ghana not to view this relief 37% reduction in the principal of Ghana's $13.1 billion Eurobond as a ""savings"" but as an opportunity to strategically plan for future debt payments, perhaps through establishing escrow accounts or sinking funds. 


The “not saved” implies that the reduction in the debt amount should not be viewed as money that Ghana (the debtor) has set aside or accumulated through savings. Rather, it is a portion of the debt that no longer must be repaid. It is not additional cash on hand but a reduction in future liabilities. 


Properly managed, debt restructuring could stabilise the cedi by lowering debt servicing costs, boosting investor confidence, enhancing government budget management, increasing economic stability, reducing speculative attacks, and potentially improving credit ratings.


These actions, collectively, can contribute significantly to the stabilization of Ghana’s economy and currency.


The 37% reduction in the principal of Ghana's $13.1 billion Eurobond, equivalent to $4.7 billion, is distinct from the relief Ghana received under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative between 2001 and 2007. Unlike the HIPC program, where the IMF directed investments in education, healthcare, and governance rather than immediate debt repayment, the current debt restructuring with the Eurobond creditors simply grants a reduction. 




Although aimed at mitigating similar economic issues like high inflation, dwindling foreign reserves, and rapid currency depreciation the debt restructuring is fundamentally different from HIPC in that it lacks specific directives for using the debt relieves funds for developmental purposes. 


This measure of debt restructuring, primarily focused on debt forgiveness will alleviate balance of payment pressures by reducing loan repayment obligations.


While the Ghanaian government refrained from labeling the reductions in the domestic debt exchange as ""savings,"" the same perspective should be applied to the external debt restructuring. This cautious approach acknowledges that these reductions are not surplus funds accumulated through economizing measures but are, instead, forms of debt relief. 


By not classifying these as savings, the government emphasizes that these adjustments serve primarily to alleviate financial obligations rather than to provide additional fiscal space. This distinction is crucial for accurate financial planning and for setting realistic expectations about the country's economic recovery and budgetary capabilities. 




It underscores the intention to manage public perception and policy formulation accurately, recognizing these fiscal strategies as necessary interventions to stabilize the economy rather than as windfalls.

Where trees fall captive in joyful pain




Neither in a besieged siege nor in a begrudged deed


shall the perish overwhelm grievous afflictions


And fest eating maladies embraced to endowed


afflictions consumed by a smashed powdered




kingdom objected to home of gladness, terms of


madness, deceased alive in its sipping heat of doubt.


Let languishing eyes fall on trembling hearts


So, the slaves possess the wrath of a healing anti-




antidote


Compassion exiled the world from God and the


numerous circumcised hearts


undertake delight in decrees and laws.




Painting the soul in tainted colours


Where death lives in life


Death itself lives in life.

The Directive Principles of State Policy: A question of justiciability or enforceability?,"The Republican Constitutions of Ghana have provided enormous democratic policies and principles which have guided the various governments in their regimes. 


However, one critical principle which was not reflective in our Republican Constitutions until 1979, is the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPOSP). It was the Third Republican Constitution of 1979, specifically, chapter 4 that birthed this principle in Ghana. 


As nature will have it, even after the military regime that cut short the Third Republican Constitution, the DPOSP still found their way in Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution when the fourth republic came into existence.


The DPOSP in its very nature serves as guidelines and a benchmark for governments to realise certain goals and aspirations.


Similarly, the DPOSP serves as an interpretative tool and where appropriate, may be used by the courts as an aid to interpretation or construction. The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in this Chapter shall guide all citizens, Parliament, the President, the Judiciary, the Council of State, the Cabinet, political parties and other bodies and persons in applying or interpreting this Constitution or any other law and in taking and implementing any policy decisions, for the establishment of a just and free society.[1] 




Further, in OCCUPY GHANA V ATTORNEY-GENERAL[2], the Supreme Court unanimously speaking through Dotse JSC held as follows;


“Furthermore, article 34 (1) which deals with the Directive Principles of State Policy provide thus:-“The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in this chapter, shall guide all citizens, Parliament, the President, the Judiciary the Council of State, the Cabinet, political parties and other bodies and persons in applying or interpreting this Constitution or any other law and in taking or implementing any policy decisions, for the establishment of a just and free society.” Emphasis The above provisions are a clear injunction on the Judiciary to bear the above in mind when interpreting the Constitution. There is thus no room for us as a Judiciary to be pedantic in dealing with issues of constitutional interpretation. This is especially so when in article 37 (1) of the Constitution, (which also includes the provisions on the Directive Principles of State Policy). It is directed that, “the state shall endeavour to secure and protect a social order founded on the ideals and principles of freedom, equality,”


The hullabaloo about DPOSP is whether or not the provisions in Chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992, are justiciable and/or enforceable. The essence of this article is to firstly, highlight the difference between “justiciable” and “enforceable” and secondly, determine the justiciability and/or enforceability of DPOSP in light of the decisions of the Superior Courts of Ghana.


MEANING OF JUSTICIABLE/ JUSTICIABILITY




Justiciable has been defined in the Black Law Dictionary, 9th Edition as follows;


“a case or dispute properly brought before a court of justice; capable of being disposed of judicially”


Justiciability has also been defined as “the quality or state of being appropriate or suitable for adjudication by a court.”


Justiciability deals with the ability of the court to assume jurisdiction over a matter and deal with it. In BAKER V CARR[1] the American Supreme Court held as follows;




“in deciding generally whether a claim is justiciable, a court must determine whether ‘the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right can be judicially molded.”


Similarly, in MENSAH V ATTORNEY GENERAL[2], the Supreme Court speaking through Aikins JSC held that;


Once there is a controversy, a justiciable issue, the court has jurisdiction to enter­tain the issue raised by the plaintiff's writ; in which case, in my view, the plaintiff can be said to be properly before the court: see the Tuffour case (supra).


The point being made is that justiciability is a prerequisite for the invocation of a court’s jurisdiction only. A matter which is justiciable will call for a competent court to assume jurisdiction. 




In captain Robert Mbati Ndana V THE CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF, THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE AND THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL[3], Anin Yeboah jsc (as he then was) held as follows;


“The jurisdiction of courts to sit in judgment over parties is derived from statute and where statute says clearly that to be justiciable claims or proceedings should satisfy specific time frames, effect must be given to them in order to give life and meaning to the rule of law, which is the bedrock of our constitutional democracy. The jurisdictional issue does not concern itself with the merits of the appeal if the proceedings are a nullity”.


To better appreciate “justiciable/justiciability” recourse ought to be made to the meaning of “non-justiciable” as it pertains to the American Concept of Non-Justiciable Political Questions. This doctrine which is premised on the doctrine of separation of powers is to the effect that certain matters are outside the adjudicatory scope of the judiciary and as such must not be dealt with by the courts. Thus, a political question is one that the courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over since they are non-justiciable. In explaining the concept of non-justiciable political questions, the court in ZIVOTOFSKY V CLINTON[1] held  that courts lack authority to decide political questions when there is a commitment of the issue to another department or where there is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving them


Essentially, “justiciable” or “justiciability” deals with jurisdiction of the court to wit, whether there exist adjudicatory matters for which the court can exercise its jurisdiction.




MEANING OF ENFORCEABLE/ENFORCEABILITY


Enforce has been defined in the Black Law Dictionary, 9th Edition as follows;


“To give force or effect to (a law, etc.); to compel obedience to”


“Enforce” in other words can be explained as giving legal effect to a provision, rule or law or ensuring its compliance. The Supreme Court has had the opportunity to explain what enforcement of the constitution means. In EMMANUEL NOBLE KOR V THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND JUSTICE ISAAC DELALI DUOSE[2], Atuguba JSC stated as follows;




“As Apaloo C.J, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court in Yiadom v. Amaniampong (1981) GLR 3 at 8 said, inter alia, “To enforce a provision of the Constitution is to compel its observance.” Certainly, it cannot be said that this court cannot compel the observance of a provision of the Constitution unless it first acquires the murkiness”


A similar interpretation had been adopted by the Supreme Court in an earlier decision of OKUDZETO ABLAKWA & ANOR. V ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OBETSEBI LAMPTEY[3], where Adinyira (Mrs) JSC stated that;“Article 2 (1) of the 1992 Constitution imposes on the Supreme Court the duty to measure the actions of both the legislature and the executive against the provision of the Constitution. This includes the duty to ensure that no public officer conduct himself in such


a manner as to be in clear breach of the provisions of the Constitution. It is by actions of this nature that gives reality to enforcing the constitution by compelling its observance and ensuring probity, accountability and good governance.”


It is therefore beyond hesitancy that the words “justiciable” and “enforceable” are not synonymous and cannot be used interchangeably as legally, they both have different meanings. Whereas to enforce a constitutional provision means to compel the observance of that provision, justiciable deals with the court’s jurisdiction to deal with a matter.




The question “are the DPOSP in chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution justiciable” has been long answered by our Supreme Court from the days of NPP V ATTORNEY GENERAL (31ST DECEMBER CASE)[1] through3 NPP V ATTORNEY GENERAL (CIBA CASE)[2] to the current position as espoused by Date-Bah JSC in GHANA LOTTO OPERATORS ASSOCIATION V NATIONAL LOTTERY AUTHORITY[3]


In the 31ST DECEMBER CASE, Adade JSC held as follows; “I do not subscribe to the view that chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 is not justiciable: it is. First, the Constitution, 1992 as a whole is a justiciable document. If any part is to be non-justiciable, the Constitution, 1992 itself must say so. I have not seen anything in chapter 6 or in the Constitution, 1992 generally, which tells me that chapter 6 is not justiciable. The evidence to establish the non-justiciability must be internal to the Constitution, 1992, not otherwise, for the simple reason that if the proffered proof is external to the Constitution, 1992, it must of necessity conflict with it, and be void and inadmissible: we cannot add words to the Constitution, 1992 in order to change its meaning. Secondly, notice that article 1(2) of the Constitution, 1992 speaks of inconsistency with “any provision of this Constitution, 1992”; and article 2(1) of the Constitution, 1992 makes reference to inconsistency with or contravention of “a provision of this Constitution.” None of these articles expresses an exception in favour of chapter 6. Does it not follow that chapter 6 too, along with the rest of the Constitution, 1992, is in the contemplation of articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution, 1992? Thirdly, the very tenor of chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 supports the view that the chapter is justiciable. The opening article, i.e. 34 of the chapter reads: “34. (1) The Directive Principles of State Policy contained in this Chapter shall guide all citizens, Parliament, the President, the Judiciary, the Council of State, the Cabinet, political parties and other bodies and persons in applying or interpreting this Constitution or any other law and in taking and implementing any policy decisions, for the establishment of a just and free society.”(The emphasis is mine.)This is a compendious provision, grouping together a whole host of state institutions and other bodies, discharging different functions. The language employed therefore has been such as caters for these different functions.”


Hence, the majority in the 31ST DECEMBER CASE held that the DPOSP in chapter 6 were justiciable.


However, in the CIBA CASE, Bamford Addo JSC after stating and discussing paragraphs 95-97 of the Report of the Committee of Experts (Constitution) held as follows;


“In general therefore it is correct to say that the directive principles are principles of state policy which taken together constitute a sort of barometer by which the people can measure the performance of their government. That they provide goals for legislature programmes and a guide for judicial interpretation but are not of and by themselves legally enforceable by any court. However, there are exceptions to this general principle. Since the courts are mandated to apply them in their interpretative duty, when they are read together or in conjunction with other enforceable parts of the Constitution, 1992, they then in that sense, become enforceable. But as clearly explained in the Report, standing independently they are not justiciable: see also article 34 of the Constitution, 1992. Every provision of the Constitution, 1992 has meaning and effect and therefore it would be wrong to ignore or disregard clear constitutional dictates. Apart from the above stated requirement for enforceability of most of the provisions of chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992, there are particular instances where some provisions of the directive principles form an integral part of some of the enforceable rights either because they qualify them or can be held to be rights in themselves. In those instances, they are of themselves justiciable also. It is my view that where provisions under chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992 are made independent rights either by specific words or by necessary implication they become of themselves justiciable rights”


In simple terms, her Ladyship held that where the provisions in chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution are independent or stood alone, then they were not justiciable, however, where the DPSOP provisions are read together or in conjunction with other enforceable parts of the Constitution, then they became justiciable.


In the GHANA LOTTO OPERATORS CASE, the Supreme Court unanimously speaking through Date-Bah JSC held as follows;


“As far as this present Court is concerned, we are of the view that, because there is a conflict between two previous Supreme Court decisions, we are free either to choose between the two decisions or to formulate a different rule that is right in our view, since there is currently no binding precedent. We would humbly submit that that right rule is a presumption of justiciability in relation to the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Constitution, 1992, as outlined above. Applying this presumption of justiciability, our view is that the economic objectives laid out in Article 36 of the Constitution are legally binding and are not merely a matter of conscience for successive governments of our land. The objectives have, though, to be liberally construed in order not to interfere with the democratic mandates of successive governments. Where, however, a government introduces legislation which is flagrantly at odds with any of the objectives set out in the Article, we believe that this Court has jurisdiction to strike down the provisions in the legislation which are incompatible with the objectives concerned. In short, article 36(2)(b) is justiciable.


The Court expressed the current position when it held that the DPOSP in chapter 6 is presumed to be justiciable.  The current position as expressed above was further reinforced by the Supreme Court in EZUAME MANAN V THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT, where Kulendi JSC in rendering the majority decision opined as follows;


“The first question that arises in that case, is whether Article 40, being one of the directive principles of state policy, is justiciable. While there has been an evolution away from the position that directive principles in general are non-justiciable, to the current position of the law that directive principles are prima facie justiciable, it must be established that Article 40 in and of itself is justiciable.”


It is my respectful view that the question “are the DPOSP in chapter 6 justiciable” has never been germane and was still birthed the first day it was asked. However, the academic exercise embarked upon by the Supreme Court in answering this question is borne out of the erroneous understanding that “justiciable” is synonymous to “enforceable”. As expressed above in this article, they are two different legal terms. Respectfully, if the court had averted its mind to the true legal meaning of “justiciable”, it would have in my opinion concluded that Articles 2 and 130 of the Constitution, 1992 had exclusively and unambiguously vested jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to interpret and enforce the Constitution. In light of this I hold the view expressed by Adade JSC in the 31ST DECEMBER CASE to the effect that Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution is justiciable as the courts can assume jurisdiction over matters involving those provisions.


In my humble opinion, the real question that ought to have been asked and answered is: ARE THE DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY IN CHAPTER 6 OF THE 1992 CONSTITUTION ENFORCEABLE?


In other words, can the executive, legislature, judiciary and the citizenry be legally compelled to enforce the provisions stipulated in chapter 6? It is this question that needs an apt resolution from the courts.


To resolve this question, resort will once again be made to Article 2 of the 1992 Constitution which empowers the Supreme Court to enforce the 1992 Constitution. On the basis of this provision alone, one would have hurriedly concluded that the DPOSP being a part of the 1992 Constitution is enforceable. However, a critical look at some of the provisions in chapter 6 will reveal that it will be harsh and impracticable for some of the provisions to be enforced especially at certain times. For example, Article 38(3) of the 1992 Constitution provides as follows;


The State shall, subject to the availability of resources provide -


(a) equal and balanced access to secondary and other appropriate pre-university education, equal access to university or equivalent education, with emphasis on science and technology;


(b) a free adult literacy programme, and a free vocational training, rehabilitation and resettlement of disabled persons; and


(c) life-long education.


Will it not be harsh, unreasonable and impracticable if a citizen of Ghana sues the Attorney-General today at the Supreme Court seeking an order of the Supreme Court to compel the government to comply with this provision and build a secondary school in his or her district?


It must therefore be understood that the execution of the goals, aspirations and policies as stipulated in Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution is dependent on so many factors which may not be within the control of the government, legislature, judiciary or the citizenry.


In short, considering the nature of chapter 6, the DPOSP stipulated therein should be presumed to be enforceable. The legal effect of this presumption is that it shifts the burden on to the other party to bring evidence to show why he/she should not be compelled to observe the specific provision in Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution.


CONCLUSION


As demonstrated above, the real question that should have been asked and answered is the enforceability or otherwise of the DPOSP stated in chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution. Despite the absence of a clear answer to this query, it is my opinion that the provisions stated in Chapter 6 should be presumed to be enforceable and not justiciable. The provisions in chapter 6 are already justiciable since by Articles 2 and 130 of the Constitution, 1992, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to determine all matters bothering the interpretation or enforcement of the Constitution which includes the DPOSP in chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution.

Dear Registrar of WAEC,


URGENT CAUTION: DO NOT POSTPONE BECE FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS


I am writing to express extreme concern and caution against any attempts to postpone the upcoming Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) for private schools. The recent announcement by your office citing financial constraints is unacceptable and potentially illegal.


Private schools have paid the full examination fees, and it is imperative that WAEC honours its contractual obligation to conduct the exams as scheduled. Lumping all basic schools together, including those that have fulfilled their financial obligations, is unjust and a clear breach of contract.




Postponing the exams for private schools would not only cause significant inconvenience but also undermine the trust and confidence in WAEC's ability to manage examinations fairly and efficiently. The consequences of such an action would be far-reaching and potentially damaging to the reputation of WAEC.


I urge you to explore alternative solutions to address the financial constraints, rather than penalising private schools that have fulfilled their obligations. The government's failure to release funds for public basic schools should not be used as a justification to punish private schools that have paid their fees in full.


I caution WAEC against taking any action that would compromise the integrity of the examination process and the rights of private schools that have fulfilled their obligations. Any attempt to postpone the exams for private schools would be met with swift legal action, and we will seek all available remedies to protect the interests of our constituents.


I demand that WAEC take immediate action to ensure that the BECE proceeds as scheduled for private schools. I expect a written assurance from your office, confirming that the exams will not be postponed for private schools that have paid their fees in full.




Failure to provide this assurance will be taken as an indication of WAEC's intention to breach its contractual obligations, and all necessary steps will be taken to protect the rights of parents and children in the private basic schools.


Sincerely,                                                                                                                                                   Evans Mawunyo Tsikata                                                                                                                     Concerned Stakeholder

Reality Zone: Atrocious story of sick woman abandoned in the bush; how low can our social instinct sink?,"When a friend abroad sent me the social media link to the story of a sick woman whose legs were cast in Plaster of Paris (POP) and dumped in a bush in a wheelchair, my response was immediate dismissal telling her the story was far fetched in a society like ours more especially when the dumping was reportedly done by an ambulance.


I followed it up with a phone call and told her the act was uncharacteristic of us, moreover by a national ambulance. I started recounting some of our social values as a people touting the overused descriptive accolade - hospitable.


The following day the media - radio, television, print and social media were all awash with headlines alluding to the sad happening. My friend's earlier story was thus confirmed.


To date, there have been different versions of the story. What perhaps is intriguing is the version of the embattled Medical Director of the Trauma and Accident Centre in Winneba where the story is said to have originated versus another version put across by several news reports. 


Morality




Nonetheless,  whether the woman was knocked down by a hit-and-run vehicle and rushed to the Centre for treatment or whether she was one of the injured persons in an accident, the moral of the story which stands so tall is what is critical. The morality therefore is how a health care Centre can dump a helpless injured sick person in a bush near Ojobi in the Central Region and left for days at the mercy of the weather in these days of unpredicted rains.


Unfortunately, the woman died in the bush by the time she was discovered. How callous could those who dumped her on the spot be?


The fact asserted by all the various versions of the story is that the woman was admitted to the hospital with leg injuries and in a confused state of mind.  However, the story alleges that she was able to tell the hospital staff that she hailed from Ojobi. 


The hospital contended that she had recovered but no relative had been in touch for the two months she was on admission. Meanwhile, she is claimed to have been a constant nuisance and bother to other patients in the hospital ward.




But assuming the woman had recovered while on admission and no relative had been around, what prevented the hospital's welfare section from accessing the many humane options which could have helped in locating and handing her over to someone who was in a position to take care of her?


Hospital welfare


Did the Centre's Welfare officials approach anyone be it individuals or institutions such as the local police or the office of the district assembly in Ojobi to help locate relatives? Was any report made at the community radio station in the area for announcements to be made in case the family had been looking for her? 


Did anyone think about putting her photo in the print media or any of the television stations to appeal on humanitarian grounds for help? Surely, her couple of months' absence from home would have prompted someone in the family or community to have acted if they were alerted of a missing person in their care.




It is just not acceptable and no attempt to justify the act can make it right, especially coming from a healthcare institution strictly governed by ethics where the sick are supposed to go for physical healing and where lives are saved and not abandoned. The act is simply unpardonable no matter how 'unruly' the patient was if indeed she was not mentally stable as some claims alleged.


Whoever hatched the inhumane ""discharged strategy"" has many questions to answer.  The plan is very uncharacteristic of an acclaimed warm and hospitable society such as ours.


With this ridiculous story, I am beginning to digest a comment made by a young man who helped me carry my shopping from a shop to my car the other day. While reaching for my purse to give him a thank-you tip to fix himself some lunch, I saw a coin on the ground and asked him to pick it up and add to what I had given him so he could buy a sachet of water.


He outrightly rejected my suggestion. With a smile, he said in the Twi language, ""Madam, the way Ghana is today, one has to be extra careful with some such things."" Some such what as I then went on to ask him if he found a purse or envelope with GH¢10,000 and he picked it up. 




He exclaimed saying, ""Madam, that is even more dangerous"". He then continued, ""People are wild and would not stop to do the outrageous and abnormal stuff to live for others to die"".


Is that where we have come to as a society and what had the young man seen or heard?   We both did not have time to go into any details as to why he claimed people are so wild for their well-being that they will do anything out of the normal to survive. 


I had no reason to doubt his claim because taking the numerous public education one has received on mobile money fraud and how people should not fall for their tricks, there are stories every day about people being scammed. 


Just last week someone tried to spring a mobile money fraud on me.  But for my alertness, the guy pleading in the name of God to reverse a mistaken credit of GH¢100 to my Momo account would have had the upper hand using the name of God to plead.

Okudzeto Ablakwa: Stop harassing Parks and Gardens over lands,"Dani Ike Estate Developers Limited are well advised to stop the harassment and go for a refund from whoever sold our prime Cantonments land belonging to Parks and Gardens to them.


I commend officials of the Department of Parks and Gardens for their courageous and patriotic resistance so far.


The 10.8 acres Parks and Gardens land was allocated on 2nd October, 1952 by the then colonial Commissioner of Lands as our foremost Horticultural Nursery. It has since served as an active green open space where diverse tree species are cultivated, and other seedlings are nursed to meet our national environmental objectives.


We shall never allow our Parks and Gardens land to be sold!


Parliament will soon launch an inquiry into the ongoing despicable state capture and all those harassing public officials to vacate because they are the new owners should get ready to appear before us at live public hearings.




Ugly State Capture shall be defeated!


For God and Country.


Ghana First

Why did you stop praying?,"It was a Saturday morning, and I had just gone down to the cafeteria to buy water for my lecturer. I saw my classmate Jibriel driving in and tried to catch his attention. Just then, I heard a voice call out.


I turned around, it was Ella, my mate from NAFTI. She had only one question for me, one she had been meaning to ask: ""Why did you stop praying? Why did you stop joining Alpha Hour?""


This question caught me off guard, especially since a colleague of ours had just gotten married the week before. The simplest answer I could give her was that I get tired from work. But trust Ella to give it to you straight. According to her, I was the reason she joined Alpha Hour, an online prayer platform that starts at midnight.


Ella said something that got me thinking and feeling guilty since our interaction. “When you needed employment, you were constantly praying. But now that you have a job, you've abandoned the platform.”


I remembered how fervently I prayed when I needed employment. I would stay up till midnight when the prayers started and join in. Sometimes I would share the link, as we were encouraged to do, so others could also join and pray. I remember when a friend fought with me because I failed to wake her up to pray. For people like me who couldn’t pray for long or didn’t know how to pray, Alpha Hour provided an avenue to pour our hearts out to God.




I know there are many people like me who have ditched God after their prayers were answered. I used to tell a friend about how merciful God is, much like the father of the prodigal son, who embraces us when we return, no matter how far we've strayed. God is truly a merciful father – you can never do this with humans.


Imagine misusing or forgetting to do what you promised your human helper when they extended a hand of courtesy to you. That person would likely never want to help you again, but it is never like that with God. No matter how far we wander away from Him, when we retrace our steps, He openly accepts us. As 1 John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.”


There is even a Christian song that talks about the endless nature of His love for us. This is a distinguishing factor between God and man and echoes the saying, “Man is man, and God is God.” Sometimes we don’t even realize we are gradually drifting away from God in the abundance of our provisions. We need people like Ella to draw us back onto the right path. People like Ella become our guiding sticks in the midst of our happiness when we forget there was once a time we were lacking and prayed for the better days we are enjoying now.


When we forget to continuously look up to the cross, our Ellas come in to guide us back to the right path. Today, if you haven't found your Ella yet to ask why you have stopped praying, let this write-up be that clarion call to get back to your source of strength. Don’t forget how it all began and how you got to where you are now. Yes, He is merciful, and His mercy endures forever, but how long you will remain here to keep renewing this mercy, you don't know. Get back to the source!

Samuel Mbura: Dutch Passport vs. PhD debate: The possible awaiting immigration consequences on Ghanaians,"It has been some time now since this issue of a choice of a Dutch Passport over a PhD at Ghana’s premier university of Ghana emerged with divergent views being expressed.


The raging debate was sparked by self-patronizing comments captured in a viral video of a supposed Ghanaian known as ‘Kofigabs’ claiming to be living in the Netherlands.


He also claimed to be a janitor and lived in the country for 10 years qualifying him to become a citizen.


In his assertion, his toil over the years as an uneducated person cleaning lavatories has eventually paid off with the acquisition of the Dutch passport, which he believes is better and more prestigious than a PhD qualification attained from the University of Ghana.


The supporting argument from “Kofigabs” as a holder of a Dutch passport, is that he can travel to many countries without applying for Visas and would also be given preferential treatment unlike, a PhD holder from Ghana who will have to go through scrutiny to apply for visas with their Ghana Passports despite their academic achievements.




Although this should not have gained any national attention, most Ghanaians have jumped into the fray in support of the warp thinking of “Kofigabs”.


I’m using the word “warp” not to describe his personality or denigrate him but his views and opinions about the Dutch Passport and PhD. It is apparent he lacks appreciation of the PhD qualifications.


For those who may not know Kofigabs alias “Mr. Happiness,” he’s the jester who’s not supposed to be taken seriously in his social media attention-seeking comments, unfortunately, he has been seen as a hero.


Now back to the main issue, it is for obvious reasons that most Ghanaians especially the youth think he’s right in his assertion. They are convinced that the governance system amid a global economic meltdown has been poorly managed thereby, making living conditions unfavorable for the citizens.




The media also widely reported had discussions, conducted Vox from citizens. And it is amazing the responses gathered so far. Arguments so far are in favor of “the new Dutch-born Kofigabs”. Some have publicly confessed of leaving the country with the least opportunity.


But there’s no need to compare the condition of living in the country used as a case study in this needless discussion that has been ignited.


My worry is the implication of comments expressed by Ghanaians on various platforms which are demeaning and damaging the credibility of the country internationally.


Mind you, whatever we do on our media spaces within Ghana shouldn’t be taken lightly , because, it transcends borders and informs other countries about the perception of certain citizens.




I’m concerned because, of my fair knowledge of international intelligence gathering that informs immigration regulations in specific countries, i.e Canada, USA, UK, and Europe.


Even locally, when an issue is of public concern arises, the security agencies especially, NIB, National Security, and Defense intelligence conduct what we call in security terms “Public Reactions(PR)”.


They sample the views of Ghanaians at drinking spots, and public places and give regional reports to national headquarters.


This information gathered then feeds into the national security advice to the government of the day and also informs certain national policies and security alertness.




Note that when citizens become agitated, it moves from an economic crisis to a national security threat since vulnerability can lead to instability.


The same applies to the most sought-after countries of destination by Ghanaians.


Do you remember recently, UK and Canada had to tighten their immigration laws?


This was after it was detected that most immigrants used the school routes to relocate their families leading to an increase in their population and pressure on the systems.




For instance, before, an undergraduate was entitled to travel with a dependent (Wife, husband, Children) for the period of study.


However, it was later realized the system was abused. And dépendant Visa now restricted to only PhD and Research Master’s students.


Not only that , deposits for Letter of acceptance from a designated institution which used to be less than $2,000 has increased astronomically.


You now have to pay a minimum of $10000,£5,000 pounds to get these documents for visa application as self-funding students in addition to a proof of funds for your tuition and stay of not less than $40,000.




The requirement will not also be complete if Province Attestation Letter(PAL) is not issued. The introduction of the PAL is to put a cap on each province and regulate the number of applications.


Even after securing the visa through these vigorous process, the last hurdle you will have to deal with is convincing the borderline security upon arrival at your destination. You can be deported even at that point if you are unable to convince them for the purpose of your travel.


There are African countries, I will decline to mention that their citizens are always scrutinized even with the legal documents as a result of damaged global reputation.


The case is however exceptional for Ghanaians , so don’t ever be deceived your Ghanaian passport is worthless and without value.




MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE


My recent travel to Canada, boosted my confidence and made me proud as a Ghanaian. I transited in three major airports to my final destination and the exceptional respect I was accorded by the airport security was amazing.


My final destination was Montreal, so upon arrival, a fellow African approached me and asked how long I was staying. When I mentioned to him, He exclaimed ! “You want to waste this visa and your money, why would you want to go back?


I explained to him that I do not have legal rights yet to work in Canada and wouldn’t want to spoil my travel record. So I will return after I’m done with my reasons for traveling to Canada.


He said “there’s a way out my brother. You know your country, Ghana there’s pressure on your President to pass the anti-gay bill into law right? So with your work as a Journalist, It will even be easier for you to get documents to begin work soon in Canada. Just explain to immigration that your life is at risk because , you are an advocate for gays and if the law is passed, your life will be in danger because, you are at risk of going to jail per the law”.


That was a smart reason to convince the officers and sell my country out just for “Asylum Status” and papers to work right? However, I thanked him for his advice and declined .


I headed to the officer sitting in a booth before the final exit and presented my documents, he looked at me and said “Samuel, you are Ghanaian. Welcome to Montreal. Ghanaians are really nice people, what brings you to Canada and where is your final destination?“ he said while smiling.


I explained to him I was a Ghanaian Journalist on an official duty and headed to Ontario, Ottawa. He was happy and my session lasted under two minutes and my passport given back to me to exit unlike others, who were detained for hours at Immigration Room for further investigations .


I saw my fellow Africans being deported not because they did not have the legal travel documents, but their country of origin had credibility issues.


I’m making this reference for us to understand that, our country Ghana is held in high-esteem internationally, which we have to fight at all cost to preserve and not allow uninformed opinions derail it just for the social media clicks.


But “my heart jumped like a cat over a wall” when I woke to the speech delivered by Former President and NDC Flagbearer John Mahama capitalized on this sentiment to make a political capital out of it.


This is an excerpt from his speech delivered at Public Lecture in Kumasi.


“Unspeakable corruption, nepotism, brazen theft, waste of national resources, impunity, and general criminality have become the hallmarks of Ghana’s current government. There is widespread despair and anguish among the people, leading to an active debate on social media about whether securing a visa for menial jobs in Europe is better than holding a PhD in Ghana.


An overwhelming majority would gladly opt to obtain the visa, signalling a complete loss of confidence and hope in our country's future. This teaches us that democracy has no meaning if it does not improve people's lives qualitatively.


With the national spirit sinking to an all-time low and hopelessness engulfing our country, a change in governance and direction has become imperative.” He stated.


He added that “That is why I have decided to run for office as President. My experience and disposition are needed at this moment to provide the leadership necessary to address our myriad problems. Given our dire economic circumstances, I am keenly aware of the weight of expectations that will rest on the next government. Real work must go into winning back our people's trust in democratic governance and structures.”


The above are his words. I’m not only disheartened by the needless comments by John Mahama, I’m shocked he’s the one making this statement.


Does he think Ghanaians really have a “short-memory”? Should we remind him about what happened under his government? The job losses , depression from unstable power supply (acute dumsor), corruption and the mismanagement? How better did he manage the economy than what is happening now ?


I believe John Mahama could’ve done better and not sell the country by further paint a bleak picture in his quest for power!


I leave this to Ghanaians to decide.


POSSIBLE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES


The Big question now is , what may be the possible immigration consequences to Ghanaians in the wake of this debate?


I must admit that, I’m not an expert in the field of international immigration laws but in my conversations with those with the expertise both home and abroad , I was able to deduce the following possible consequences.


The comments made by Ghanaians about leaving the country and preferring a Dutch passport over a PhD in Ghana may have several immigration consequences, including:


Increased scrutiny of visa applications: Ghanaian citizens may face closer scrutiny when applying for visas or residency permits in other countries, particularly in the Netherlands.


Stricter requirements: Immigration authorities may impose stricter requirements or additional documentation for Ghanaians, such as proof of strong ties to their home country or additional financial guarantees.


Delayed processing times: Visa applications from Ghanaians may be delayed or take longer to process due to the perceived risk of immigration fraud or abuse.


Reduced immigration opportunities: The comments may damage Ghana's reputation and lead to reduced opportunities for Ghanaians to travel, study, or work abroad.


It is my fervent belief that we can do better as Ghanaians to uphold and defend the good name of mother Ghana no matter the situation. Patriotism should always triumph over pessimism and partisan politics.

Remembering President Jerry John Rawlings on his 77th birthday,"Today, would have been your 77th birthday President Flt Lt Jerry John Rawlings. We gather in spirit to honour and commemorate the life and legacy of an exceptional leader. Though you are no longer with us, your profound impact on Ghana, Africa, and the world continues to resonate. The J. J. Rawlings Foundation reflects on your contributions, enduring influence, and how deeply you are missed.


An Advocate for GhanaJerry John Rawlings was a man of vision, passion, and relentless dedication to the welfare of Ghana. Rawlings’s journey from a young air force officer to the helm of the nation was driven by a deep sense of duty and an unwavering commitment to justice.


In 1979, Rawlings burst onto the national scene, leading a popular uprising to address corruption and restore accountability within the government. This bold move marked the beginning of a transformative era in Ghana's political history. The actions of the June 4 leadership underscored their dedication to eradicating corruption and ensuring that the government served the people.


Rawlings’s leadership during the 1981 revolution and his establishment of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) set the stage for significant economic and social reforms. His pragmatic approach to governance, coupled with his vision for a prosperous Ghana, led to the implementation of policies that stabilized the economy and promoted development. Under his guidance, Ghana underwent a period of economic recovery and growth, laying the foundation for future prosperity.


His tenure saw a focus on infrastructure, education, and healthcare, which improved the quality of life for countless Ghanaians. Schools, hospitals, and roads were built, reflecting his belief that a nation’s strength lies in the well-being of its people. Rawlings’s efforts to promote social justice and equity ensured that the benefits of development were widely shared, creating a more inclusive society.




On rural development, policies were implemented that expanded Ghana’s middle-income group. In 1990, the National Development Policy Framework (NDPF) was developed under the National Development Planning Commission, which subsequently became known as Ghana Vision 2020 – a long-term plan for Ghana to become a middle-income country by the year 2020.


With food security a priority for Rawlings, agricultural policies were initiated that resulted in the recognition of Ghana’s food production growth of 148 percent for the period 1995-1997 as “the third highest achievement on the record after Jordan (157%) and China (156%)” in the World Bank’s 1999-2000 Development Report.





A Shining Light for African UnityJerry John Rawlings’s influence extended far beyond the borders of Ghana. He was a staunch advocate for African unity and development, believing that the continent's strength lay in its collective efforts. His leadership and vision for a united Africa inspired many across the continent.


President Rawlings was a vocal proponent of Pan-Africanism, a movement that seeks to unify African nations in their quest for political and economic independence. His speeches and actions emphasized the importance of solidarity among African countries, urging them to work together to overcome common challenges. Rawlings’s belief in the potential of Africa and its people was evident in his tireless efforts to promote cooperation and mutual support among African nations. In October 2011, he was appointed as Ambassador of the Pan-African Parliament. A year before he had been appointed by the Conference of Heads of State of the African Union as the AU High Representative for Somalia, a crucial period when strong leadership was required to ensure the needed political transition and stability in the war-stricken country.




President Rawlings forged strong relationships with other African leaders, working collaboratively to address issues such as poverty, conflict, and underdevelopment. His influence was instrumental in fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose across the continent. Rawlings’s legacy as a champion for African unity continues to inspire current and future leaders to strive for a more prosperous and united Africa. His significant role in resolving the Liberian conflict cannot be forgotten. In 1994 under his chairmanship of the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS), the Akosombo Accord and Accra Peace Agreements were signed.


A Global StatesmanPresident Rawlings’s impact was not confined to Ghana or Africa; he was a respected statesman on the global stage. His eloquence, passion, and commitment to social justice earned him admiration and respect worldwide. Rawlings’s voice was a powerful one in international forums, where he advocated for sustainable development, good governance, and human rights.


Rawlings’s efforts to promote peace and security were evident in his involvement in various international initiatives. He played a key role in mediating conflicts and promoting dialogue in regions plagued by instability. His contributions to global discussions on development and governance underscored his belief in the interconnectedness of nations and the importance of working together to address global challenges.


Throughout his career, Rawlings maintained strong relationships with global leaders and organizations, contributing to discussions on issues ranging from economic development to environmental sustainability. His legacy as a global statesman is a testament to his belief in the power of international cooperation and his commitment to creating a better world for all.




An Unforgettable LegacyAs we mark what would have been his 77th birthday, the absence of Flt Lt Jerry John Rawlings is deeply felt. His leadership, vision, and unwavering dedication to justice left an indelible mark on the world. Rawlings’s passing in November 2020 was a profound loss for Ghana, Africa, and the international community. However, his legacy continues to inspire and guide us.


Rawlings’s ability to connect with people from all walks of life, his humility, and his commitment to justice made him a beloved figure. He was a leader who truly cared about the well-being of his citizens, and his actions reflected his deep-seated belief in the power of the people. His charismatic personality and principled leadership endeared him to many, leaving a lasting impact on all who knew him or were touched by his work.


In Ghana, Flt Lt Rawlings’s contributions to economic stability, social development, and democratic governance have left a lasting legacy. The institutions he helped build and the reforms he implemented continue to shape the nation’s progress. His vision for a just and prosperous Ghana remains a guiding light for future generations.


Across Africa, President Rawlings’s advocacy for unity and cooperation continues to resonate. His belief in the potential of the continent and his efforts to promote solidarity among African nations serve as an enduring source of inspiration. His legacy as a champion for African unity is a reminder of the power of collective action in achieving shared goals.




Rawlings Lives OnOn this special day, we celebrate the life and legacy of President Jerry John Rawlings. His remarkable contributions to Ghana, Africa, and the world are a testament to his visionary leadership, unwavering dedication, and deep commitment to justice. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on, inspiring us to strive for a better, more just, and prosperous future.


Happy birthday, President Rawlings. You are deeply missed by your family, friends, admirers, followers and millions of people in Ghana and across the world. Your spirit and vision continue to guide us. Thank you for your service, your leadership, and your unwavering commitment to the people. Your legacy will forever be remembered and cherished.

Enimil Ashon: Kayayei hostels versus electric Okada,"What a battle! As of June 2024, some nail-biting still goes on. We need a true prophet of God, a Mallam who fears God and a powerful traditional priest to predict the fortune of the two major candidates – John Mahama and Mahamadu Bawumia in the December presidential election.


If I have to put a store by what I am hearing from students and young ones, then Cheddar and Alan Kyeremateng, together, could force a re-run. The students love Cheddar.


I am not unaware of the credible scientific polls that call the election for the NDC/NPP candidates, but I still caution restraint. Mind you, no candidate has launched their manifestos.


I am surprised nobody is giving Yours Truly some credit for the accuracy of my prophecy. Didn’t I warn John Mahama early this year that he was going into the hottest contest of his life since 1992?  


The signs were on the wall at the time – and they still are. Bawumia is a fierce strategist and his team is a deadly bunch. They have demonstrated an admirable ability to turn the most negative communication to their candidate’s advantage. That is why, even with the polls suggesting that Bawumia was the laggard (as of early 2024), I was seeing writings on the wall that told me it was early days yet. The latest poll by that Professor that put Bawumia ahead cannot be wished off.




Two years before anybody in NPP had a hint that the Vice President would throw in his hat, only his most trusted and closest confidants in Jubilee House (including Akufo Addo and, perhaps, Samira) had been hinted. As everybody slept, they were sowing seeds – visiting churches, being publicly seen in photo-ops with Father Campbell, donating to the National Cathedral, Bawumia was being quoted copiously in the media that “Christians and Muslims serve the same God”. Within the NPP, the prediction was either an Alan Kyeremateng sole run or hard to beat.


Even when the Vice President declared, it became difficult for anybody to use the religion card because, before you opened your mouth, there were newspapers and radio news and analyses accusing people of playing religion.


Outside of human strategists and official pushers, I, earlier than most Ghanaians, foresaw the big political advantage of those Bawumia-inaugurated projects in the five northern regions and parts of Oti. Funded by the World Bank, those are vote-swaying, game-changing, mind-bending projects.


Well, as they say, all is fair in love and war.




I like Mahama. His opponents in NDC did not see through the brouhaha in the 2021 legal acrobatics. All the talk about having been cheated and threats of going to the Supreme Court whose verdict he pooh-poohed was to prepare the minds of the party masses to conclude that John Mahama didn’t lose the 2020 elections. In that scenario, it was easy to ask for another chance as a flagbearer.


I opposed his Okada politics in 2020, and I still do, but who am I? I am one person against nearly two million Okada riders and their families. This time, Mahama’s promise is even juicier to the riders. Which struggling man will not shout “wow” when he is promised an electric motorcycle that does not depend on fuel? Such motors don’t consume petrol, the battery will be charged down.


In a country where “susu” has been the backbone of millions of mobrowa personal economies, it is easy to understand when promised that “you will pay in bits”. Everybody will own a motorbike without sweat!!!


Now hear Mahama’s last promise on Okada: “We will also assist those who don’t have a license to get a license.” Eiii!




But the battle rages. From afar, Bawumia saw hordes of young girls, and thousands of head porters called kayayei. He didn’t see girls; he saw votes!


Who’d shut the mouth when precious juice is dripping on the tongue? The 100,000 Kayayei in Ghana held their breath when Bawumia cut the sod for work to begin on the construction of a four-storey hostel facility at Adjen Kotoku, as part of seven others in seven municipalities.


The girls jumped around in exhilaration when Bawumia inaugurated the facility that would not only provide accommodation for them but also be an avenue where they would be trained with some vocational skills such as dress-making and hairdressing. would be established in the Ashanti and Bono East regions.


In May this year, Bawumia launched an initiative dedicated to empowering a total of 5,000 kayayei “through the transformative power of Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and enhance their socio-economic status”.




It is known as the Kayayei Empowerment Programme, to train cohorts of 5,000 head porters in modules such as baking and beading.


The juiciest: participants will be given GHc1,000 each by YEA upon completion of the training. Eiii !!!


I tell ya: all is fair in war and love – and politics.

Peter Otokunor: Ghanas Tragic Saga of Food Inflation- Empty Plates and Empty Promises,"As Ghana grapples with skyrocketing food prices, a harsh reality unfolds—the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government’s lofty promises of prosperity under a taxation-to-production regime have left many citizens with empty plates and stomachs. The stark truth is that the cluelessness, incompetence, poor management, corruption, and the wanton dissipation of the limited public resources have resulted in a relentless surge in food prices. We are now grappling with an insidious food crisis threatening the nation’s food security. Food scarcity and for that matter food inflation are pushing the most vulnerable sections of society into hunger, despite claims of agricultural transformation through the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme.


Food prices have spiraled out of control under the NPP’s watch, leaving millions of Ghanaians on the brink of starvation. Food inflation has soared to unprecedented levels, peaking at 61% in 2023 and 29.6% in 2024. Essential items such as vegetables (tomatoes, pepper, onions, plantain, cabbage), rice, plantain, and cassava have become unaffordable luxuries for the average citizen. Meanwhile, the ruling elite feasts on the spoils of corruption and greed, while ordinary citizens’ dignity is shredded by an indifferent government.


Several factors have contributed to this surge in food prices. One major factor is the over-reliance on imported food products. We currently import over $ 400 million worth of tomatoes annually from Burkina Faso, constituting over 800,000 metric tonnes of tomatoes annually. Despite Ghana’s agricultural potential, our agriculture sector is confronted with major challenges, most of which are managerial. This over-reliance on imported food has been occasioned by the slump in local production due to the high cost and inadequate supply of inputs such as fertilizer, poor quality seeds, the lack of mechanization, the lack of extension services, and non-availability of agro-credit for agriculture. The consequence is the inherent vulnerability of the economy to exchange rate volatilities and international price fluctuations. The depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi against major currencies has exacerbated the situation, making imports more expensive and driving up local food prices.


Dr. Peter Boamah Boamah Otokunor, the author


The roots of this crisis lie in the government’s failure to implement coherent agricultural policies and provide effective leadership in times of crisis. The much-touted Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) initiative, which is currently in the second phase, has been ad-hocly managed with no proper policy guidelines, ineffective monitoring systems, and defective reporting mechanisms. The PFJ has become a haven for partisan rent-seekers as a result of the opaque nature of the implementation. Furthermore, allegations of mismanagement and corruption have plagued the initiative, leading to skepticism about the government’s commitment to addressing the root causes of the food crisis. Despite billions of cedis poured into the programme, farmers continue to grapple with myriad challenges, from lack of access to quality inputs and extension services to poor postharvest management, inadequate market linkages, and price volatility.


The PFJ was hatched on the back of a Canadian facility secured by H.E President John Dramani Mahama in 2016 (as part of which 50 tractors were delivered to support the Agricultural Mechanisation Services Centres: AMSECs) to give further impetus to the gains made under the METASIP 2014 – 2017(Medium Term Agricultural Sector Investment Policy). The initiative which was originally announced as an NPP campaign slogan was started without any stakeholder consultation or proper assessment of the METASIP framework to draw lessons from the experiences to establish proper linkages. It is instructive to note that, Ghana’s major agricultural policy, the Food and Agricultural Sector Development Policy (FASDEP I and II), which was originally promulgated in 2002 (amended in 2007) as part of the GPRS I and II after Vision 2020 was jettisoned, had been the backbone of the successful METASIP I and II from 2009 and to 2016, which led to the longest period of lowest food inflation and for that matter single digit inflation in Ghana after several decades.




Even though I bear the opinion that the FASDEP has outlived its usefulness and requires an immediate reconstruction to meet the prevailing food security needs of the country, the PFJ has proven to be heavily inconsistent in outcome, to the objectives and provisions of the FADEP II. Currently, there is no officially promulgated comprehensive report of the PFJ I from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, yet we have been told that a PFJ II has been launched, similarly without any properly promulgated policy framework. It appears the government is more interested in sacrificing the need for a robust, workable, and sustainable agriculture development programme for cheap partisan benefit and needless political sloganeering.


Adding insult to injury, the government’s shortsighted measures have worsened the suffering of ordinary Ghanaians. The hastily initiated and ill-timed attempt to place restrictions on importing certain food items, supposedly aimed at promoting domestic production, has backfired spectacularly, leading to acute shortages and skyrocketing prices. Poor infrastructure, lack of access to modern farming techniques, and inadequate support for smallholder farmers continue to hinder agriculture production. Rather than fostering an environment for agricultural growth and innovation, these knee-jerk measures have deepened the crisis, leaving ordinary Ghanaians to bear the brunt of the government’s folly.


Behind the statistics and economic analyses lies the human toll of Ghana’s food inflation crisis. The repercussions of rising food prices are devastating, particularly for low-income households that spend a substantial portion of their income on food. Many families are forced to cut down on their daily meals, leading to increased malnutrition and food insecurity. The nutritional deficits resulting from reduced food intake are particularly damaging to children, leading to stunted growth and long-term health issues. Some families are forced to make heartbreaking choices between feeding their children and paying for other essential needs like education and healthcare. The World Food Programme (WFP) has reported that nearly 2 million Ghanaians are at risk of severe hunger, a stark contrast to the country’s previous achievements in reducing poverty and improving food security.


As the gap between the rich and the poor widens, the government’s ineptitude and indifference to its citizens’ plight stand as a damning indictment of its leadership. This tragic saga of food inflation and empty plates underscores a complex interplay of unmet promises, maladministration, leadership paralysis, and lack of vision of the Akufo Addo/Bawumia government.




Addressing Ghana’s food inflation crisis requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond temporary fixes and political sloganeering. Sustainable solutions must be prioritized to create a resilient agricultural sector capable of withstanding economic and environmental challenges. Enhancing agricultural productivity through improved access to inputs, technology, and training is crucial and can help reduce post-harvest losses and stabilize the food supply. Sub-regional collaborative efforts can also help to enhance food security and trade, to provide a buffer against external shocks.


Key measures may include:


1.       Investing in Agricultural Infrastructure: Improving roads, enhanced input supply, cheaper sources of input, mechanization, storage facilities, and irrigation systems to support farmers and reduce post-harvest losses.


2.       Supporting Smallholder Farmers: Providing access to credit, modern farming equipment, and training to enhance productivity and income.




3.       Efficient Economic Management: Policy measures to stabilize the cedi and control inflation are also essential. Strengthening economic governance and reducing corruption can improve the efficiency of government programmes and ensure that resources reach those who need them most.


4.       Enhancing Governance and Accountability: Ensuring transparency and efficiency in implementing agricultural programmes to prevent corruption, mismanagement, and rent-seeking.


5.       Value Chain Development: Additionally, promoting value addition and local food processing can create jobs and reduce reliance on imports.


Ghana’s food inflation crisis is a poignant reminder of the fragile nature of food security in the face of economic, environmental, and governance challenges. The empty plates seen across the country are a stark contrast to the promises made by the Akufo Addo/Bawumia government. It is imperative for the government to show leadership by spearheading a call for action to bring all stakeholders, the private sector, and the development partners, to come together and address this crisis with urgency and sustained commitment. Only then can Ghana hope to turn the tide and ensure that no Ghanaian goes to bed hungry.

Yaw Nsarkoh: Willy Mutunga  The Sage,"At the conception of The Sages project, we were determined to make it Pan African, even if it would stretch us logistically to do so. Our stated objective has been to capture the reflections of many of our distinguished senior scholars in electronic audio-visual formats for younger generations of Africans across Global Africa. We have considerable evidence that younger generations consume media differently, and so if literature (old fashioned print) is not augmented by audio visual channels, lots of past scholarship will simply lose functional effectiveness.


Professor Mutunga is the first non-Ghanaian Sage, but there will be many more from all over continental Africa, and also the diaspora in the Caribbean, North America, etc. He is a man of an unusual blend of attributes; hardened freedom fighter but also soft-spoken and compassionate. He is the ex-Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya (2011-2016), ex-political detainee at the hands of the Moi-Nyayo Gestapo, ex-academic and more.


In this wide-ranging and very original conversation, Mutunga shares deeply from his life experiences; right from being born in the village and riding the education bus to get to the apex of his chosen profession.


He reminisces on life in the University of Dar es Salaam in the era when it was known as a crucible for progressive scholars. The faculty while he was there included famous names like, Giovanni Arrighi, Walter Rodney and Akilagpa Sawyerr. He was a student at the same time as people like Professor Issa Shivji, and Yoweri Museveni.


Willy Mutunga talks about becoming a young academic at the University of Nairobi and fighting the Kenyan dictatorship for academic freedom, which included a frontal battle to get Ngugi wa Thiong'o out of prison. For his reward, Mutunga was locked in prison for 16 months.




He has many things to say about geopolitics and its implications for Africa. Mutunga does not hedge when he speaks, his remarks on the African condition are scalding in some parts, but honest. That feature transcends even into discussions of how to treat sexuality in Africa, a subject many dare not broach. And Ruto, the current President of Kenya, does not get off lightly, nor does Museveni.


In this interview, Willy Mutunga shares from a highly personal, but still professional vantage point, what it is like to be a Chief Justice that adjudicates over a presidential petition in a politically hyper-polarised society.


I recommend this episode of The Sages to you. Mutunga keeps the refreshing quality traditions of The Sages, in elevating development discourse beyond what he calls ""the politics of division."" The noisy partisan factionalism that will kill us if we do not kill it first does not gain expression here, people can disagree, even disagree assertively, but still be civil. We are grateful that he made time to do this.


Watch Prof Willy Mutunga on The Sages which airs on the JoyNews Channel at 12pm this Saturday, June 22.

Fuseini Iddrisu: The unsuccessful meaning of success- Putting a Dutch Passport and a PHD debate into a proper context,"Recent developments about choosing between obtaining a Dutch passport and pursuing a PhD have engaged my thoughts about success and the need to put the conversation into proper perspective in the context of our educational system, which prepares people for the so-called successful life.


I am proficient in discussing this subject because of my combined teaching experience at the pre-tertiary and tertiary levels. I will share my insights into how society, especially students, perceive success and what the education system has engineered for them to pursue to be successful. 


One of the significant concepts about education I learned from my professional training at the College of Education is training socially accepted individuals who will fit in any environment and contribute to society's advancement. This vision rested on skills development, knowledge empowerment, and character training. The school system was to unearth individuals' potential and help them nurture these unique qualities for their personal growth and a triggering transformation in the larger society.


Paradoxically, the same school system that created this exceptional triumvirate of critical areas (skills development, knowledge empowerment, and character training) for assessing the success of a child's education botched the very foundation of its assessment policies.


Let me start with the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) assessment and the popular ""ten ones"" mantra of success. The BECE assessment did not include a component for assessing skills development and character training. The exam only rewarded recall of knowledge with little emphasis on application in real-life situations. Successful students were those who could adapt to this abstract way of learning. 




The assessment scheme did not scrutinize the character competencies and skills-based development of the so-called successful 'ten ones' pupils. The BECE evaluation model did not include any options for empirically evaluating the desired character traits and skills-based development necessary for societal development. One looked at the child who scored an aggregate 40 yet was very respectful, punctual, time conscious, and had exceptional athletic ability as an unsuccessful child just because they could not make more ones in the BECE. In the eyes of society, these achievements didn't count so long as these kids did not line up ""ones"" in the final results; they were failures.


It didn't matter how these lads or lassies deemed successful acquired the grades, and nobody was interested in analysing the context of the failure of those who failed.


I taught in the basic school, both private and public, for at least 15 years. I should know that most of these kids pass not because they are intelligent. Similarly, many fail, not because they are failures. However, the school system designs who must fail and who must pass, and these kids are just a manifestation of the poor and biased system that only rewards recall of knowledge ahead of creativity.


A society that chooses this reward scheme in its educational structure leads to dissatisfaction and becomes detrimental for individuals deemed unsuccessful due to their inability to achieve the required academic standards for advancing their lives within the educational system. The system engenders feelings of hopelessness and presents difficulties in maintaining their survival despite the values and critical skills acquired through the educational system.




This phenomenon elicits a legitimate sense of envy among individuals considered unsuccessful by the educational system toward those regarded as successful. This envy is justified because many of these classified failures did not fail; instead, the system could not acknowledge and reward them for the essential skills and desired attitudes they acquired during their education.


A similar system prevails and exacerbates at the senior high school level regarding skills-based training schools, commonly called technical and vocational skills training schools. We look down on these training places with so much discontent, as if only those who fail at the basic school must be in these training schools. I have experienced countless incidents where parents feel insulted and disrespected for suggesting vocational and skills-based training for their wards because the system least recognizes these places of training.


Let's look at a situation where some of these tagged school system failures get a breakthrough to become considerably wealthy. They feel fulfilled and direct the pain and anger they have endured from the unfair system to the system's beneficiaries.


To put it in context, they believe that the system favoured the so-called successful people by rewarding their competencies in recalling knowledge. However, the system jettisoned their version of competencies: positive attitudes, values, and skills-based capabilities. At the very least, the system never gave them a chance. Nevertheless, they have made it and surpassed the former in wealth. In such a situation, they turn to hate education and consider it a waste of time that is not worth pursuing.




Apart from the diaspora mutineers rebelling against their country, thus Twene Jonas, Paul Tabi, Mr Happiness, the Dutchman Toilet Cleaner, and the rest, we often hear people in Ghana make utterances like they have employed university graduates even though they do not have a university degree. These pronouncements confirm the disappointment of not getting rewarded through our education system for these individuals' special skills that society needed for its transformation. Eventually, most of them pay or lobby for an honourary doctorate title in their unique skills to cure that inherent rejection of the school system that continues to linger in their mind.


Coincidentally, some of the students interviewed on this PhD versus a Dutch passport debate are my students at the university. Their responses were not unexpected. However, I saw a wake-up call to interrogate the kind of education we want to give our young brothers and sisters at the university. Every student I have taught at the university can attest to one prominent advice I mostly give on the first day of meeting them.


I tell them one can acquire two types of certificates at the university. The first is the paper certificate attesting that one has completed a university programme, and the second is the brain certificate manifesting in job delivery, attitude, and creativity. I have always encouraged my students to focus on the brain certificate and graduate with the best of class. It is the surest certificate that will prepare them for a quality life.


Albeit the effort to try to orient students to change their mindsets and the over-obsession with first class at the expense of fostering positive attitudes, creativity, and problem-solving skills, many of them still would want to chase effortless marks even if the lecturer gives out the grades for free for no work done. After all, they fall for society's definition of university educational success, which is to smash first class. No one cares about the attitude and skills one develops during university education.




The lack of proper skills and attitudes to make them productive causes most of them to become unemployed and eventually end up poor people with first-class certificates. The same society now highlights the unsuccessful success of their first class, which did not translate into wealth. 


The enigma surrounding society's perception of success becomes profound in this sense when the society that previously regarded individuals with high educational achievements as successful now celebrates those who were once labelled failures within the education system but have become wealthy people as successful individuals. The latter are now glorified and held up as role models due to the accumulation of wealth through their endeavours.


Curiously, the same society turns to look down on the much-touted first-class successes that travelled to give birth to a PhD as worthless simply because these achievements do not come with significant financial prosperity. So, what is success, and how do we measure it to know who is successful and who is not in our modern society? I quiz.


Modern society defines success as equivalent to wealth without recourse to any values. Thus, the expensive car you drive and how fat you donate during social occasions define your success in life. This obsession about success explains why politicians steal to be successful, the youth sell the little investment they have accumulated to travel outside, and some people engage in sakawa to be successful.




However, I see heroes and heroines who save lives at the hospitals in Ghana even though they are more qualified to clean toilets and earn better privileges in a foreign land. I see dedicated PhD holders who travel abroad for conferences and come back to serve their people even though they could have absconded to look for cheap citizenship through marriage. I see teachers paid less, yet they educate children and instill values and discipline in them, which you may not find in most kids in the West. Do we say all these people are unsuccessful in life because they don't hold a Dutch passport?

Useless Column: Prince?,"Some people are funny o. Carrying firewood to go and sell is not just your hobby but your source of livelihood. You naaa you know you are not from any royal family and your father is also a blacksmith and an ordinary one as such. It is interesting how almost everyone you talk to says he is from the royal family. Wey kan royal family! Imagine my name being ‘Prince Mawuli Zogbenu’. From which kingdom? I realised this when my Dad died some 30 years ago. An autopsy was to be performed and my senior siblings resisted as they stated that we did not want that to be done because we are from a royal family.


Royal where? Hehehehe! I was 18 then and when I overheard them, I laughed inside my head! Big Brother Abraham himself was the leader of the ‘delegation’ and explained that as royals, no razor was to touch Papa’s body. Why did I even address him as ‘Dad’ when the poor soul was a ‘Papa’! ‘Dad’ is often used for the…you know what I mean. Royal family? For the where? Kisseman Kingdom or Christian Village eyi? Royal family man, good afternoon o, Mr Abraham Zogbenu. Hahahaaaa! It was poverty that killed my old boy o. We didn’t have tiiin to pay for some medications and what can come, came. Poverty it was yet we were there protesting an autopsy just because ‘we are from the royal family’. Abeg, let me walk pass and go er! We lied o: we are nobodies.


In fact, we were at the lowest ebb of the classes of the ordinary indigenes of my hometown yet we say we are royals. Go to my hometown now and see. Even the village chief himself could be seen jumping from one mango tree to the other plucking unripe mangoes to survive and we are here in Accra saying we are royals. Tweeaaaa! Nothing annoys me more than those who call themselves Prince or those who give birth and name their children ‘Prince’. Which kind of Prince? The suffer suffer one like me? Or just because the name ‘Prince’ sounds nice? You would have noticed I deliberately remained silent on ‘Princess’. That one is not common though you would hear Mothers especially calling their daughters ‘my Princess’ but it is not added to their names. My problem is with the men who allow themselves to be called ‘Prince’ when it is because the name sweet them, not because they are from the royal family. Royal where? Be careful o, Prince. Hahahahaaa!


Do you remember Sonny, that small boy in my neighborhood who has been coming to wash my car on Saturdays? He is called Prince too la! This boy would wash my car and every time he did, I gave him money. That fateful Saturday after washing the car, I only took the car key from him and didn’t give him anything; neither did I say anything apart from ‘THANK YOU’. In less than 5 minutes, I saw him come to pass in front of my house and greeted loudly: ‘Bra Mawuli, good morning’ to which I responded. In another 10 minutes, he came back again greeting, this time louder ‘Bra Mawuli, I say good morning o’. I really didn’t get it; why I should be greeted many times in the morning. Until the 4th time, I didn’t realize the guy was doing ‘debt recovery’; he wanted his money and had to apply some degree of subtlety to get his money for services rendered! Hmmm! Some of today’s youth are just not ready to do anything for free! It’s unfortunate! Maybe they are learning it from some of us the older ones. ‘What is in it for me?’ is a common unfortunate one. I don’t even know if it is a statement or a question. Hmmm! Almost everyone wants something for doing something. Ei! Ansrewa!


If ‘Prince’ had lived in a zongo before like I did, he would know that helping older people is communal service and an honour to God and part of the growing up process. In our growing up days, you’d serve everybody without expecting anything in return. In fact, you felt good for washing your neighbour’s car!




As you enter this week, let me warn you o.‘Oh Bra Sammy, you can pour it inside bcos I am in my safe period’ is the ‘agreement’ that creates street children o! Go ahead and be ‘pouring and borning’ by heart and become irresponsible. Go ahead and don’t protect yourself against STDs and unwanted pregnancies. You will come and meet me here. Behave yourself and stick to only your wife o, yoo, Komlavi! HIV still dey o, yoo!


I have been coughing for the past one week. It usually starts as soon as I finish laughing. What should I do? Please your advice is critical especially if you are a medical doctor. Last year when I had a similar coughing matter and sought advice from Sammy having given him the same cause, he asked me to stop laughing so I will not cough again. Is that fair? How on earth should I stop laughing just because I don’t want to cough? Abeg, let me laugh and cough ooo! Hahahaaa!


You know, the danger in keeping a strange woman (I mean a woman who is not your wife) in your company can be dire and could even end you in jail? I never imagined this. That night, in my hotel room, Korsiwa came for her usual ‘prayers’ and that was when she broke the bad news to me. We had agreed to let her sleep over to sort things out. At about 1.38am, she started shivering fafafafafafa! Ei what is this, I panicked. There was no hospital around for me to take her to. What if the worst happens in this case? She could die oo, I imagined. I called someone I knew in the area and he mentioned a clinic nearby.


The night duty nurses were attending to nature’s call at that time of the night la! I expected them to have refused to pick that nature’s call and attend to Kosiwa. Fortunately, one of them came to my rescue and when we got to the car to bring Kosiwa out, she walked towards us amazingly happy and laughing. What has changed? Kosiwa said she was ok and didn’t need a doctor again. Ei, wonders.




Kosiwa now narrated her story about having eaten cooked beans with fried eggs very late at 11pm hence her stomach upset and after filling my car with ‘Gana gas’, she was ok now. What a relief! Since then, I have learnt not to subject myself to questions I cannot answer. I hate it. As I think about the consequences, I avoid taking certain actions.


So what actually made Korsiwa ‘pregnant’ was unknown; it was the beans and eggs! If I knew earlier, I would just have arranged a bigger and a more spacious chamber pot for her to do the needful rather than the hell she took me through running from hospital to hospital…for nothing. You see why my coughing cannot stop coughing because anytime I remember this incident, I laugh not because of the incident o, but because Korsiwa also calls herself ‘Princess’. Princess Korsiwa broke pass me sef!


Next time, when you think of having fun with a stranger in a hideout or in the absence of your wife at home, think… ‘what if this person dies in my house or in the hotel room’? Or it is not possible? It happens o, yoo! After all, you are not even a prince.


Till, we meet again next weekend to have this ‘useless’ fun, before you say something [often negative] about someone, remember this: ‘What Paul says about Peter tells us more about Paul than about Peter’ (Baruch Spinoza)! Bye byeeeeee!




Sin fascinates and assassinates!

Acting overlord of Bimbila writes: A decade of grief,"A decade of reflection and hope as I pen down this with a deep sense of loss. I strive to uphold the legacy of my beloved father, Naa Andani Dasana Abdulai, who was cruelly taken from us in 2014.


This year marks the tenth anniversary of his tragic death, and as we reflect on his life and legacy, it is essential to remember the values he stood for and the lessons we must learn as a kingdom.


His ascension to the throne was marred by controversy and opposition, yet he faced these challenges with unwavering resolve and dignity. Through numerous court battles, he emerged victorious, proving his rightful place as the chosen leader.


However, despite legal victories, acceptance from his opponents remained elusive. In a cruel twist of fate, on a peaceful day in 2014, while the king was engaged in the sacred act of prayer, his life was brutally ended.


This barbaric act of violence not only took away a beloved father and leader but also struck at the heart of our kingdom.




The pain of losing a father in such a heinous manner is indescribable.


It is a wound that time can never fully heal. His murder was not just an attack on our family but a direct assault on the principles of justice, peace, and humanity.


As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of his passing, it is imperative to reflect on the lessons we must draw from this tragedy. We either allow the darkness of the past to consume us or we honour the late king's legacy by working together towards a brighter future.


First and foremost, we must turn to God in times of strife and uncertainty. He was a man of faith, and his devotion to prayer was a testament to his unwavering belief in the power of divine guidance.




It is crucial that we seek solace and direction from our faith. We must trust in God's wisdom and justice, even when human actions seem incomprehensible.


Moreover, we must cultivate a deep respect for human life. The sanctity of life is a fundamental principle that transcends all differences—be they political, ethnic, or religious.


My father's death was a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance. It is a call to all of us to cherish and protect the lives of those around us, regardless of our disagreements. Every life lost to violence is a failure of our humanity.


As we remember Naa Andani Dasana, let us also reflect on the potential for greatness in our kingdom. We are capable of so much more when we choose to value and uplift each other.




The king’s vision for Nanung was one of unity, progress, and mutual respect. He believed in the power of strength that comes from standing together.


In the past decade, I have taken on the mandate to handle the affairs of our area, striving to honour a noble king’s legacy.


It has been a journey of immense responsibility, but also one of profound learning. I have seen firsthand the resilience and potential of our people. I have witnessed moments of incredible unity and support, which remind me that, despite our past, we can build a better future.


Education and understanding are vital components of this journey. Too often, individuals who position themselves as educated elites misuse their influence to manipulate young minds, pushing some youth towards violence and chaos with misguided ideologies.




When faced with such manipulation, ask them to explain all the judgments from the courts in a way that is easy to understand. With the right explanation and a little love for Nanung, you will find pride in joining the palace for the development of the kingdom rather than feeling your presence marks a celebration of victory.


Remember, the truth stands firm; its outcome seldom surprises.


We must educate ourselves and future generations about the importance of peace, respect, and values. We must learn from our history to ensure that such tragedies never happen again. Let’s create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.


Let us not only mourn his loss but also celebrate his life and the ideals he championed. Let us commit to building a Kingdom that honours his memory through acts of kindness, justice, and respect for all.




It is within our power to transform our pain into a beacon of hope and progress. The barbaric murder of Naa Andani Dasana was a dark chapter in our history, but it must also be a turning point.


Let us honour his legacy by striving for a kingdom where faith, respect for human life, and unity are paramount. Together, we can ensure that his vision for a better Nanung lives on, guiding us towards a future filled with promise and peace.

Is Ghana Airports Company listening? Active thievery in unaccompanied baggage section,"Concentrating on my baggage problem report, I overhead not one, not two but multiple lined-up unhappy complainants at the Kotoka International Airport (KIA) baggage complaints office last Saturday morning.


These individuals were visibly angry and swearing bitterly about their tampered-with unaccompanied bags that had arrived days earlier.


They had come in that early Saturday morning to take possession of their unaccompanied items having received promptings that their bags were finally in.


Their shouts and outpour of grievances were so loud, that one could not avoid eavesdropping.  


The signals I got therefore were that all was not well at the storage centre where passenger’s unaccompanied bags and other belongings were kept on arrival at the KIA for reclaiming.




Complaints


My bag did not arrive that Saturday morning with the flight so I had gone to this office near the baggage claims area to lodge a complaint and complete the necessary forms for tracking.  


While there, these unhappy persons came in with their tampered bags to lodge complaints.


The first man to be attended to had opened his bag and realised the lock had been broken, as he unzipped the bag, he found some empty carrier bags which he had originally used to wrap some items during packing. 


It was obvious that someone had entered the bag and taken some items there.




While on it, another person came in with a hard case suitcase whose padlock had also been broken. 


He had come complaining of stolen items from his bag. I could count at least three other persons, including a lady who was in line with complaints of tampering.


As I was waiting for the officer on duty to print out my complaint form, I observed a real tussle of dissatisfied customers unfolding. The question that ran through my mind was: where is the Ghana Airports Company (GAC) in all that was going on, that is, the complaints of thievery?


I said the GAC because the supposed thievery was happening on their premises and nowhere else.




The entire KIA and for that matter, all the other airports in the country are under their administration. 


These are high-security areas and yet from what one observes, there are too many people, some attired and some not, who come and go in the area.


Staff


Yes, they may be staff of the company, but do we really need that number mingling with passengers at the baggage claims area when after all, baggage trolleys are freely provided for passenger use?  


It was so repulsive the other day, hearing one such mingling staff asking unashamedly as he wheeled a trolley to a passenger and remarked: “Perhaps you could offload your coins to me”.  His message was too direct and shameful.




Apart from that, on the issue of alleged thieveries, one wonders where the electronic security surveillance at KIA is.  


Definitely those opening and taking items from passengers’ unaccompanied bags are doing so undisguised and could be recognised by security cameras.  


One cannot imagine that the unaccompanied baggage claim area does not have security cameras.


That should not be for any area within the inner confines of any high-security institution such as the airport. 




Even if the culprits are not necessarily staff, what would be their right to be in such a protective enclave and to have time to do what they do without being found out?   


On the other hand, if electronic cameras are in place, then arresting the culprits and bringing sanity to the area should not be a problem.


One wonders how the problems of any dissatisfied individual are settled, having witnessed the process of complainants, including being asked to complete some kind of a form, while I was in there.


But that notwithstanding, the issue at stake has more to do with the safety and protection of passengers’ unaccompanied personal effects flown into KIA.  




GAC should be concerned about the bad image the miscreants are creating for the country’s airports.


Some investigations need to be conducted and people made accountable. Thievery at KIA is not only a security risk, but it is also a shameful act that needs to be stopped.   


One would call for strict implementation of restrictive access for all manner of persons, including third-party access, into any of their buildings where especially passenger bags are stored.  


That should go for all the airports around the country.

Enimil Ashon: Prof Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng immortalised,"On Tuesday, June 11, as Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng stood pondering the significance of this once-in-a-lifetime ceremony, he was heaving with emotions. 


He had just witnessed the unveiling of a bust mounted in his honour by the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, which he once headed as Chief Executive, and the National Cardiothoracic Centre, the world-class monument which owed its very existence to his passion, foresight and never-give-up spirit.


This ceremony, which is often held in memory and honour of departed heroes of international and national stature, had sent him into immortality. The bust was his very image and he was alive to witness it!


So why was he fighting off those tears of emotion? After all, this was not the first honour he was receiving. Indeed, three-quarters of his multi-page CV is about honours heaped on him by the world.


But this ceremony was different; it was a first in many senses. Having swam in shark-infested waters at the two institutions which he either helped to create or modernised, he had least expected honour from them.




Achievement


On this particular Tuesday, memories, such as a tape recording, played back in his mind. In 1975, as the best candidate in the final examination of the University of Ghana Medical School, he won the Easmon Prize in Surgery.


 Ten years later in Germany, he had performed the first of scores of heart transplantations (1985), becoming the first black person to have performed a heart transplant.


On December 5, 2001, the Soviet (CIS) Trained Doctors Association recognised him for ‘Devoted and Meritorious Service to Ghana’. The German Surgical Society conferred on him Honorary Membership in May 2011 and a year later, in 2012, the University of Ohio, Athens, USA, named him the African Hero.


Locally, the Millennium Excellence Award scheme adjudged him Personality of the Decade in December 1999. In the same year, he won the Chartered Institute of Marketing, Ghana, Marketing Man of the Year award and in 1998, he was recognised by the Ghana Civil Service for meritorious services rendered to Ghana.




All of the above honours, and others too numerous to list in a 1,000-word article, were for three overarching distinctive achievements: first, as the first Black person to have performed a heart transplant; second, for establishing  Ghana’s first Cardiothoracic Centre in 1992 amid stiff opposition, particularly by the “system”; third, he had, as CEO of Ghana’s premier teaching hospital, succeeded in “taming the monsters” within and without, including coffin makers!


But, like every other human being, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng has had enemies, some of them his creation; many others born of envy, politics and professional rat-race competition in dangerous seas infested with sharks.


In facing professional opposition, he remembers only too well what his teacher and professional mentor, Professor Easmon, went through in his attempt to carve out a small corner within the Gynae Centre at Korle Bu for the treatment of heart diseases in 1964. He was criticised, sneered at and given names.

Establishing Cardio Centre


Rather than discourage him, the birth pains of Prof. Easmon’s heart unit prepared the young Frimpong Boateng to face his demons, 30 years later on his return home from Germany with his big dream to set up a cardiothoracic centre.




 In addition to performing heart surgeries, his dream was a centre for training Ghanaian doctors in cardiology and (along with nurses), in intensive unit critical care. That dream started forming in his mind around 1981.


Thankfully, the PNDC bought into it in 1986 and 1992, Ghana etched its name in history with the opening of its National Cardiothoracic Centre. But it is one thing to establish a centre for treating cardiovascular diseases and another thing to make its service attainable for the poor.


Thus, he set up the Ghana Heart Foundation, with donor funds - the principal donors being ordinary people who had responded to the Professor’s appeal to donate GH¢20 per Ghanaian.


Out of this fund, the Foundation pays 50 per cent of the cost of heart surgery. These are the works for which the Professor has been remembered by society. It is almost impossible to overstate the impact and importance of Kwabena Frimpong Boateng to the global medical institution.




After the ceremony, I sought him out and asked if, in his opinion, the Cardio Centre was not being run down. Without hesitation, he replied, “Absolutely not.” He has high regard for the present Director, Professor Mark Tettey, who he says, is doing a good job.


“Seeing what he is doing now, I wish that he had been with us from the beginning.” For fuller details of how Professor Frimpong Boateng came to set up the centre now known for short as Cardio, readers are encouraged to get their hands on his first book, DEEP DOWN MY HEART. In it, you will discover steely determination and selflessness in a professional on a mission.


CEO of Korle Bu


How he became the CEO of Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, his battle with his demons, including coffin makers, the walling of the entire hospital and the building of the new Administration, are tales of how legends are made. That account is published in his second book, TAMING OF A MONSTER.


That book goes beyond a compilation of statements of fact about his physical achievements. It is a textbook from which lessons in ingenuity, selfless leadership, foresight and prudent management of resources are learned.




He admires the work of the present team of professionals at Cardio. Professor Tettey and his team want to transform the centre into an institute. That’s no mean task but it is a task whose time has come.


For it to happen, they would need specialists in cardiology, including foetal cardiology, anaesthesia and X-ray.” He adds a word for Ghanaians, in general: “Medicine in general, and heart surgery especially, have moved on. 


There are new forms of management such as key-hole surgery on the heart and lungs. Now these procedures can be done with minimal invasion techniques. The task is urgent, but these things take time.


What is needed is patience on the part of Ghanaians and the government’s intervention to secure the needed equipment and training.” Is Prof. on retirement? Officially, yes, as far as formal government work at Korle Bu is concerned, but he has not retired as a doctor or as a heart surgeon.




He is actively involved with two other hospitals in the country. One of them is the Providence Specialist Hospital at Achimota, Accra, a specialist hospital for surgeries of all major diseases but with heart surgery as the main speciality.


The other is the Frimpong-Boateng Medical Centre at Toase in the Atwima Nwabiagya South District of Ashanti Region which is also up and running. This centre, established with the collaboration of some German friends, is well on its way to setting up a College of Health Sciences to train heart personnel, among other fields of specialisation.


It has started with general nursing. As a writer, I will miss Prof. at Korle Bu. Sadly, I will never set sight on his wall clock – one of a kind. That clock has been so calibrated that the seconds, minutes and hour hands travel anti-clockwise!


Acts anti-clockise actions


Somehow, that is how I have come to know the personality of Professor Kwabena Frimpong Boateng: he thinks, reasons and acts anti-clockwise. For instance, not everybody will understand why, against advice from well-meaning friends, he found himself in politics. Perhaps, with the benefit of time, we have to appreciate that Providence wanted to use him to lift, even if slightly, the veil covering Ghana’s biggest failure: the fight against galamsey.  




But he should be the first to admit that politics has not been the most glorious part of his life story. The part of his life that I wish the clock would go backwards 20 years is Frimpong Boateng as a crusading environmentalist.


As a journalist, curiosity drove me to his house 15 years ago where I saw his wife cooking on a gas stove: the gas coming into the stove was biogas, made from the garbage in the home!


When Prof. wanted to be the NPP flag bearer, he went around the country campaigning in a car powered by jatropha oil produced by himself. When Ghanaians were debating the usefulness of solar, and the fear that it was expensive, he encouraged a young engineer, Gideon Agyare, to light up Korle Bu with street lights powered by solar.


The mentorship relationship thickened and bore fruit, even to the benefit of Prof. himself. This young solar engineer converted Prof’s Mercedes Benz 280S into an electric car! Note, dear reader: this was long before the invention of Tesla or any electric vehicle.


After the unveiling last Tuesday (June 11), I asked Prof. what he had to say on an occasion like this. His words were as simple as they were touching: “Thank you, Ghanaians. Without your GH¢20, there would have been no Cardio. I owe everything to you”.

Obinna Uche: From fossil to renewables  Nigerias journey starts today,"Like many of its counterparts across the globe such as the US, China and Japan, Nigeria is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs. However, unlike many of its fossil-heavy peers, 92 million Nigerians don’t have access to energy, with the country currently generating and supplying between 3,000 and 4,000 megawatts of grid electricity to over 200 million citizens.


It is therefore a country in crisis, which makes an even stronger case for an energy mix that includes sources such as renewables.  Again, like many countries across the world, Nigeria is dealing with an aging and dilapidated energy infrastructure, which struggles to transport the generated power effectively.


To alleviate some of the energy generation strain, Nigeria has integrated several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) into the generation mix, including hydro, thermal stations, and other smaller plants. These form part of the licenses that were granted by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in 2022.  However, it is still not enough to meet the population's energy demands.


Important building blocks


The good news is that Nigeria is undoubtedly setting a firm foundation for energy transformation and access acceleration.  In 2023, Nigeria enacted the Electricity Act (2023), which aims to reform the energy sector.




By embracing market deregulation, promoting renewable energy, protecting consumer rights, and strengthening regulatory oversight, the act seeks to attract private investments, enhance efficiency, and provide reliable electricity to all Nigerians


In practice, the act is already enabling individuals, organisations and states to engage in power production and distribution. For example, entities producing more than 1MW can now sell to neighbouring communities or organisations.


As mentioned, Nigeria already has hydro plants that provide energy, however, the country also has an abundance of sun for solar generation as well as wind, with a recent paper  The Potential for Wind Energy in Nigeria citing wind is strongest in: “hilly regions of the North, while mountainous terrains of the middle belt and northern fringes have high potential for great wind energy harvest”.


Furthermore, solar solutions are becoming more affordable due to developments in technology and proactive government policies. Globally, technological advancements have in the last five years significantly reduced the price of solar panels and batteries. Additionally, various countries like Nigeria have introduced incentives and policies to encourage the adoption of solar solutions.




Nigeria is also accelerating the adoption of solar power through innovative financing options.  There is no doubt the initial upfront investment in solar can be prohibitively expensive, however, plans like lease-to-own/as-as-service or pay-as-you-go can undoubtedly bolster solar adoption.


In the case of lease-to-own organisations pay a flat monthly fee and eventually own the solar solution. The pay-as-you-go model allows consumers to only pay for what they consume.


Grants and subsidies from organisations like the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AFDB) are also reducing the end cost for customers, making solar energy more affordable and accessible.


Last, but certainly not least, is the job opportunities that come with implementing renewables. The renewable energy industry offers opportunities for installation, maintenance and repairs, among others.




The government can leverage this to train unemployed youth in these areas, thereby creating job opportunities. Ultimately, more jobs equate to a stronger economy and more taxes that will allow government to improve services such as energy provision.

Kwesi Yankah: Poor Mahamudu; the sad plight of a happy man,"Mahamudu Bawumia looks like a happy man having roused the country to its feet since May. With all eyes on him, he has quietly choreographed the new face of party-political campaigns.


Mahamudu has asked his campaign team to shed arrogance, quit plush offices, and show respect to the masses that empowered them. He has also worked the minds of pedestrians; and for once, plush V8s and long convoys attract public boos.


Mahamudu’s campaign prospectus was simple knowing his party’s elitist history. ‘Drop arrogant convoys; bring along the long bus; leave your suits at home, your neckties, flashy footwear. Wear smart sneakers, sweatshirts, and jeans.


To top this, come with substantial reserves of stamina, and where necessary go a-borrowing for deep breaths. Be prepared for marathon walks across rugged terrains, open gullies, towns, hamlets, markets, bus stops, and congested spaces.


Bring along towels for sweat, and be ready for rough patches and stumbling among crowds in narrow corridors. Avoid heat stroke and rush to the bus if exhausted. Breaking the 8 is a long walk to freedom and development.’




For a party people with elite and lawyers that was a huge sacrifice, and it worked.


His new face of campaign softened hearts and stirred mammoth crowds, that stampeded to peer at him, touch him, do selfies and hear him speak, some of this happening in ‘enemy territory.’ As for handshakes, should a new slogan be coined it could well be: One week, one million handshakes.


It has also been great times for the youth, whose language Mahmoud speaks eloquently. His own age even speaks louder. A selfie with him is gold. His digital agenda is also a familiar world to the sprawling youths, and they are comfortable walking with him into the future.


I saw him beam with smiles across the country hobnobbing with kids, squatting to hug disabled, dancing Jama with students, playing the draughts game with locals, bowing to elders, and waving across distances.




The enthusiasm Mahamudu Bawumia has stirred in the midst of hard times should give him a sigh of relief. The signs clearly foretell a great future.


Deep down, however, Bawumia cannot be a happy man. The freedom to choose a running mate of his choice is under siege. For the first time in the history of his party, contestants have been openly announced by self-appointed electoral commissions, that release nominations in a trickle, and a hint of front liners, dark horses and dropouts; these have changed by the day.


Mahamudu’s recent tour of the Ashanti region was said to have been scheduled to drop the choice at the home front; grand celebrations had even been planned by optimists. This has been made worse by social media cheerleaders, accomplices and mercenaries who release screaming headlines of a choice which has ‘already’ been made.


Names have even been dropped ahead of a declaration which is still pending. Then come gender groups who at an eleventh hour have come with timely reminders. ‘You know we women are in the majority when it comes to voting, so Alhaji advise yourself, otherwise….’




Unfortunately, lobbying has now transmuted to blackmailing: ‘Pick our preference or else the Ashanti masses you dearly need, will turn their backs on you.’ The pre-choice of Ashanti as the agreed home of the running mate has gone further to preferred households and names.


Lobbying brigades are overworking, along with blackmailers who hint at dreadful consequences in ignoring preferred choices. Fliers and billboards are out juxtaposing Mahmoud’s image and those of a preferred candidate. Indeed the stage has been set for hell to break loose should one choice be made and others dropped. A split on the front party is imminent.


The sense of optimism originally glowing at Mahmoud’s campsite, was thus bound to dim; replaced overnight with a broken spirit as he headed back from Ashanti. Bawumia might be confronted with a peculiar plight hitherto unknown in the party’s history, which becomes more pronounced as we inch closer to his announcement.


As never before in the party’s history, tension and suspense await the declaration of a running mate; and we pray it does not lead to another postponement.




J.A Kufuor suffered no such plight; his choice of Aliu Mahama was quietly done on his own terms. Mahmoud’s own selection as running mate by Nana Akufo-Addo for the 2012 and 2016 elections, was without drama and suspense. Never any threat of fire and brimstone. What’s new?


Are we shifting the goalpost for a Tani flagbearer?


Have the rules changed? No, it’s rather the times. Tribalism has returned in another cloak. The great party has elders who should step in and boldly put the house in order. Huge gains made in the past year may dissipate in thin air should the choice of running mate be foisted on Mahmoud Bawumia.


The message should be simple. The party will respect their flagbearer and not denigrate his person or preference. Mahmoud should not be reminded of his status as Tani and make an exception to prevailing rules.




Having been duly elected as flagbearer, he has the right to even say, ‘I have made a decision; it’s One or even None of the Above.’


The open campaign for running mate, public name-dropping, blackmailing, and veiled display of tribalism must stop.


Council of Elders please step in and restore the party’s dignity.

Yaw Nsarkoh: Burning and looting in the city...,"The looting of core state properties in opaque circumstances, by those with political power, is a route to the very capture of that state. In the end, it is likely to lead to the negation of all pretences of democracy.


Therefore, the criteria of disclosure for the purchase of state properties by senior state actors, ought to be made very high.


In my view, it has been treated too casually by our political culture. This is something that bears all the hallmarks of related party transactions.


While I do not subscribe to an outright ban on PEPs from participating in legitimate business, such activity must be accompanied by very strict governance protocols. Public service is not a genetic obligation; those who want privacy in business should simply stay out of political office.


Asset declaration protocols, of self and close relatives (properly defined so people do not loot and then stash under others' names), need to be implemented. Then a very high bar must be placed on the disclosure of intent to sell and the sale itself, by law.




At the minimum, beneficiaries of such transactions, I suggest, should be compelled by law, to disclose financial contributions made to political parties and political actors. By them and/or any proxies acting on their behalf.


I also fail to understand, why state-owned businesses, intending to flog assets on their books, do not do so through the Ghana Stock Exchange. That approach will deepen the markets, build the muscles of the exchange, and bring greater transparency that enables broad participation.


When too often, beneficiaries of such transactions are from the party in power, it is understandable that anxiety breeds cynicism. And vice versa.


CHRAJ should move quickly to establish the facts through a diligent process. As regards the current matter of the sale of hotels by SSNIT. Until that is done, no one is guilty. Nor will even the innocent be free.




It is the facts that can lead to informed decisions on whether the divestiture of hotels is, in principle, right or wrong.


Had I my way, all such transactions since the beginning of the Fourth Republic in 1993, should be published. A democracy involves public reasoning, and public reasoning is only meaningful when it is based on the right information.

Cecil Sunkwa-Mills: Is delivering HD free-to-air in Ghana doable?,"High-definition (HD) broadcasting has seen a significant rise globally, with many countries transitioning to provide HD content to meet the growing demand for superior picture quality. In recent years, the focus has shifted towards making HD content accessible not just through PayTV services but also via free-to-air (FTA) models.


Global Trends and African Context


Globally, the adoption of HD broadcasting is well-established, with many countries having fully transitioned to HD transmissions. In Africa, this trend is emerging, driven by the increasing availability of HD-capable televisions and a rising demand for higher-quality viewing experiences. 


While the continent faces unique challenges in infrastructure and economic constraints, notable strides are being made towards HD broadcasting.


Ghana’s Progress Towards HD Broadcasting




In Ghana, various platforms have started delivering HD content, traditionally a domain of PayTV services. This movement towards HD content is facilitated by the broader availability of HD-capable TVs and devices in the market, alongside a growing appetite for high-quality content among Ghanaian audiences.


Delivering HD content via FTA in Ghana is achievable but comes with specific challenges. Key among these is the need for increased transmission capacity to handle the higher bandwidth required for HD signals, which are significantly more demanding than standard definition (SD). 


This necessitates substantial investments in upgrading infrastructure, including satellite capacity and transmission equipment or collaborating with third-party platforms.


Market Readiness and Business Models




Despite these hurdles, the readiness of the Ghanaian market for HD content is improving, as more households acquire HD-capable devices. This creates an opportunity for platform owners to distinguish themselves in a competitive market by offering superior HD content.


The business models for TV platforms are evolving, influenced by the rise of online streaming services. Traditional subscription-based models, where viewers pay for access to a bundle of channels, coexist with FTA models, where channels rely on advertising revenue. There is also a hybrid model combining elements of both, offering basic FTA channels alongside premium subscription services.


Free HD channels  for 5 Million Homes: Bold Move by SES HD PLUS


A notable example of this shift is the bold initiative by SES HD PLUS to partner with its HD channel providers to offer their channels free-to-air. This is a major business pivot from their initial subscription-based model where viewers at home had to pay. This strategy leverages existing relationships and broadens the reach of HD content throughout the MultiTV platform, which reaches over 5 million homes across West and Central Africa.




I remember vividly the launch of HD channels on DStv in 2019 throughout Africa. In Ghana, it started with the two channels MNet HD and Supersport HD. This was met with a lot of customer excitement and delight, specifically for movies and sports events through the more exciting crystal-clear viewing experience. 


For sports fans, that HD feature enhanced the viewing details and an enhanced affinity. Another addition was made with Discovery HD towards the end of the year. These additions positively impacted the launch of the HD+ Service later in 2020 in Ghana, especially with a more affordable subscription pricing proposition.


The shift towards delivering HD content on multiple platforms in Ghana represents a significant opportunity for platform owners to attract and retain listeners and viewers, as well as to drive growth in the region’s digital entertainment industry and evolving media landscape with a chance of increased HD content licensing. To succeed in delivering HD FTA, SES HD PLUS and similar platforms must focus on:


Partnerships with Content Providers: Securing broadcasting rights for a diverse range of HD content to attract viewers. The change by SES HD PLUS offers content producers an opportunity to rethink their production quality, processes, and output so HD content can be sourced locally, driving growth in the under-patronized local content production industry.




Emerging Advertising Revenue Sources: Broadcasters can leverage the high picture quality of HD channels to collaborate with advertisers and businesses, attracting non-traditional channels such as travel, shopping, and experience-based advertisers. This presents a significant opportunity for businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive market by offering high-quality HD-based advertising to their audiences.


Marketing and Promotion: Raising awareness about the availability and benefits of HD content through effective campaigns.


Revenue-Sharing Models: Developing business models that allow platform owners, advertisers, and broadcasters to benefit from this innovation.


Conclusion




From my perspective, initiatives like HD+ free-to-air demonstrate the feasibility of HD FTA broadcasting in Ghana with the adoption of the right business model. The increasing prevalence of HD-capable TVs and the growing demand for high-definition content indicate a strong market potential. By leveraging strategic partnerships, robust distribution channels, and effective marketing, platforms can tap into this opportunity and contribute to the democratization of HD viewing in Ghana.


The successful introduction of HD channels by platforms like DStv has already shown that there is a significant appetite for HD content, particularly for movies and sports. This positive reception underscores the potential for FTA HD broadcasting to thrive in Ghana. With the right investments and strategic approaches, delivering HD content via free-to-air models in Ghana is not only possible but also a promising avenue for enhancing viewer experience and driving industry growth.

The discipline of self-reflection for Ghanaian and African CEOs: A transformative approach amidst challenges,"Introduction


In the dynamic business landscape of Ghana and Africa at large, the role of the CEO is increasingly multifaceted, requiring not only strategic acumen but also a deep understanding of personal and organizational dynamics. One tool that is often underutilised but holds immense potential is the discipline of self-reflection. For CEOs, self-reflection is not just a personal growth tool; it is a strategic practice that can influence company culture, operational efficiency, and societal impact.


Situational Analysis


Consider the case of Kwame, a CEO of a rapidly growing tech startup in Accra. Amid the pressures of scaling operations, securing funding, and navigating the competitive landscape, Kwame finds himself struggling with strategic clarity and leadership effectiveness. Despite the company's success, he feels disconnected from his team and uncertain about the long-term vision. 


Through the suggestion of a mentor, Kwame begins to incorporate self-reflection into his routine, setting aside time each week to evaluate his decisions, understand his emotional responses, and realign his personal values with the company's mission. 


This practice not only enhances his decision-making skills but also improves his relationship with his team, fostering a more cohesive and motivated workforce. Kwame's story illustrates the transformative potential of self-reflection for African CEOs, yet it also highlights the challenges that come with adopting such practices.


Challenges


Despite its benefits, the practice of self-reflection faces several challenges in the African corporate context.




1. Cultural Perceptions: In many African cultures, introspection and emotional expression are not traditionally emphasized. This can make self-reflection seem foreign or unnecessary to some business leaders, who may prioritize external achievements over internal growth. This cultural barrier can be particularly strong in environments where stoicism and external displays of strength are highly valued.





2. Time Constraints: The demanding nature of the CEO role leaves little time for self-reflection. The constant pressure to perform, coupled with numerous responsibilities, means that setting aside time for introspection can be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity. The high-paced business environment, driven by the need to meet quarterly targets and immediate challenges, often sidelines reflective practices.


3. Lack of Awareness and Training: Many CEOs may not be aware of the techniques and benefits of self-reflection. There is often a lack of structured programs or mentors to guide them in this practice, leading to a reliance on external consultants who may not fully understand the local context. The absence of established frameworks for self-reflection within corporate training programs further exacerbates this issue.


4. Fear of Vulnerability: Self-reflection requires confronting one’s weaknesses and failures, which can be uncomfortable. For CEOs, admitting mistakes and vulnerabilities may seem risky, especially in cultures that value strong, decisive leadership. The fear of appearing weak or indecisive can deter leaders from engaging in reflective practices, despite the long-term benefits.







Opportunities


Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for Ghanaian and African CEOs to harness the power of self-reflection.


1. Enhanced Decision-Making: Self-reflection enables CEOs to make more informed and balanced decisions. By understanding their own biases and thought processes, leaders can approach problems with greater clarity and creativity. Reflective practices such as journaling, meditation, and regular feedback sessions can help leaders dissect their decision-making processes and improve them over time.


2. Improved Leadership: Reflective leaders are often more empathetic and self-aware, qualities that are crucial for effective leadership. They can better understand and motivate their teams, fostering a positive and productive work environment. Empathy and self-awareness contribute to stronger relationships within the organization, enhancing team cohesion and morale.


3. Strategic Alignment: Through self-reflection, CEOs can ensure that their personal values and vision align with the company’s goals. This alignment can lead to more coherent and sustainable business strategies. Reflective leaders can anticipate market trends, adapt to changes, and align their organizations' missions with evolving societal expectations.




4. Cultural Transformation: By modeling self-reflective practices, CEOs can inspire a culture of continuous improvement and learning within their organizations. This can lead to greater innovation and adaptability in the face of changing market conditions. When leaders prioritize self-reflection, it sets a precedent that encourages employees at all levels to engage in similar practices, fostering an environment of growth and development.





Societal Impact


The practice of self-reflection by CEOs has the potential to create ripple effects that extend beyond the confines of their companies, influencing broader societal change.


1. Ethical Leadership: Self-reflective leaders are more likely to act with integrity and accountability, setting a standard for ethical behavior within the business community. This can enhance public trust in corporate leadership and contribute to a more transparent business environment. Ethical leadership promotes fair practices, reducing corruption and fostering a more equitable economic landscape.


3. Social Responsibility: CEOs who engage in self-reflection are often more attuned to the social and environmental impacts of their business decisions. This can lead to more socially responsible practices and initiatives that benefit the wider community. Companies led by reflective leaders are more likely to invest in community development, environmental sustainability, and social equity programs.




3. Economic Growth: Reflective leadership can drive business success by fostering innovation, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. Successful businesses, in turn, contribute to economic growth and job creation, which are crucial for the development of Ghana and Africa. By prioritizing sustainable growth and ethical practices, reflective leaders can help build robust economies that benefit all stakeholders.


4. Inspiring Future Leaders: By demonstrating the value of self-reflection, current CEOs can inspire the next generation of leaders to adopt this practice. This can create a legacy of thoughtful and effective leadership that continues to benefit society in the long term. Young leaders who see the benefits of self-reflection are more likely to incorporate it into their own leadership styles, perpetuating a cycle of reflective and responsible leadership.





Conclusion


The discipline of self-reflection holds great promise for Ghanaian and African CEOs, offering a pathway to more effective leadership, strategic clarity, and positive societal impact. While challenges exist, they are not insurmountable. By embracing self-reflection, CEOs can not only enhance their own performance but also contribute to the broader development of their organizations and communities. As Africa continues to rise on the global stage, the adoption of self-reflective practices among its leaders can play a pivotal role in shaping a prosperous and equitable future. Reflective leadership can transform the business landscape, fostering ethical practices, driving sustainable growth, and inspiring future generations of leaders to build a better society.

Open Letter to Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo on Denu High Court,"HER LADYSHIP JUSTICE GERTRUDE ARABA ESAABA SACKEY TORKORNOO 


THE CHIE JUSTICE OF GHANA


JUDICIAL SERVICE OF GHANA · 


P.O. BOX GP 119, ACCRA 


Dear Honorable Chief Justice,




URGENT APPEAL TO ADDRESS THE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT DENU HIGH COURT


I am compelled to write to you today to bring to your attention the dire status of the Denu High Court in the Southern Volta Region. As a recent visitor to the court, I was appalled by the deplorable conditions that jeopardize the legal process and the safety of the judges, personnel, and all the other visitors.


The Denu High Court, with its rich history and significance, has served the Ghanaian people well. Its status as a case study for Natural Justice (Procedural Fairness) for all law students is well known.


However, when I recently visited the court, I was astonished and dismayed to discover the condition of the facility. The cashier's office was filled with rainwater, leakages in the courtroom and I couldn't help but think about the security of the crucial documents kept there. The guest benches in the courtroom were likewise in poor condition, creating possible safety dangers to individuals attending court hearings.




Your Ladyship, I urge you to solve these issues immediately, including:


1. Renovating the courthouse for a safe and dignified atmosphere for all users.


2. Taking steps to protect documents and data from harm.


 3. Performing necessary maintenance and care to prevent further degradation.




I would like to request that your honourable office take fast action to correct this condition and engage the duty bearers to allocate the funds required to repair and restore the Denu High Court. It is our responsibility as Ghanaians to ensure that our justice system is efficient, equitable, and accessible to all. This is impossible to accomplish unless we provide our courts with adequate resources.


Time is of the essence, as the Denu High Court's terrible state jeopardizes the fair administration of justice. I urge you to take quick action to address this pressing issue and demonstrate your unwavering commitment to ensuring equal access to a robust and reliable legal system for all Ghanaians, regardless of geographic location.


I am confident that under your leadership, the Denu High Court will be restored to its former glory, standing as a shining example of the judicial excellence that Ghana is known for throughout the world.


Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.




Sincerely,


Evans Mawunyo Tsikata

Xatse Derick Emmanuel: Dumsor predates WAPCOs gas supply challenges,"Ghana has been experiencing Dumsor long before the recent gas supply challenges announced by WAPCo .


Credible data available, representing total system power generation at peak periods (10 pm), shows that Ghana has been experiencing power generation deficits throughout this year. 


This was evident even before WAPCo's announcement, which is expected to further increase the generation deficits (more DUMSOR).


As  of  December  26,  2023,  Ghana's  system  peak  load  stood  at  3,618  MW,  representing  a  4.3% increase  from  the  2022  recorded  peak  demand.  In  2024,  system  peak  load  is  estimated  to  be  3,788 MW,  reflecting  a 4.7%  increase  from  2023 Energy  commission  report  2024. This  means  that,  Ghanas  peak  demand  is  expected  to  be  around  3788  MW. Therefore any power generation below 3788  MW  will  result  in  DUMSOR.


Power  generation  at  10:00  PM represents  the  peak  system  power  generation  and  the  10:00  PM  also represents  the  peak  demand  period  of  power.  System peak  power  generation  has an average value  of  3188.12  MW (January to June 4th). Monthly  averages at these time were January 2024 =3162.45 MW, February 2024 = 3276.00  MW, March 2024 = 3154.73 MW, April 2024 = 3199.50 MW, May 2024 = 3161.29 MW, and June 2024 = 3101.33 MW.




1. The  system  peak  power  generation  represents  power  generated  for  both  domestic  usage and  export.


2. The  total  demand  peak  also  includes  power  demanded  domestically  and  for  export.


3. The  average  power  generated  at  peak  periods  (10  pm)  from  January  to  June  4th,  2024, stands  at  3188.12  MW.  This  figure  is  far  below  the  peak  demand  for  even  2023,  recorded on  December  26th,  2023,  at  3618  MW,  let  alone  meeting  the  peak  demand  projected  at 3788  MW  for  2024 based  on  the  energy  commissions  report.


4. This  means  that  from  January  to  June  4th,  2024,  Ghana  has  never  been  able  to  meet  its peak  demand where  its  power  generated  (supply)  will  meet  the  peak  demand. There  is  a deficit  in  power  generation  between  429.88  MW  and  599.88  MW  when  using  the  2023 peak  demand  of  3618  MW  or  the  projected  peak  demand  of  3788  MW,  respectively.




5. Therefore,  a  deficit  in  power  generation  of  600  MW is  accounting  for  the  DUMSOR.  From January  2024  to  June  4th,  2024,  Ghana  experiences  DUMSOR  of  about  600  MW.


6. With  the  new  development  where  WAPCo  has  announced  a  gas  supply  challenge,  causing ECG  and GRIDCo  to issue  a joint  press release,  th end  effect  is  that  Ghana  will  experience more  DUMSOR,  meaning  there  will  be  a  deficit  in  power  generation  beyond  600  MW.


7. The  other  good  news  is  that  the  thermal  plants  can  operate  on  Light  Crude  Oil  (LCO)  or Heavy  Fuel  Oil  (HFO).  Apart  from  Sunon-Asogli Power  (SAPP)  and AMERI,  which  rely only  on  Natural  Gas,  the  rest  operate  on  either  HFO,  LCO,  or  LPG.  Therefore,  with  proper financial  capacity,  Ghana  should  be  able  to  generate  enough  power  to  meet  its  peak demand.  Ghana  has  an  installed  generation  capacity  of  5,194  MW,  excluding  embedded generation,  which  correlates  to  a  dependable  capacity  of  4,756  MW.  This  means  that  Ghana should  be  generating  enough  power  to  exceed  its  peak  demand.


8. In  conclusion,  ECG  and  the  government  should  not  ascribe  the  DUMSOR  to  WAPCo's  gas supply  challenges  because  we  have  already  been  generating  power  at  a  deficit  of  600  MW even  though WAPCo's gas  supply  challenges  will  worsen  the  DUMSOR  situation,  but  not when  the  majority  of  the  thermal  plants  can  operate  on  either  HFO,  LCO,  or  LPG  in  place of  Natural  Gas.

Ekow Amoasi: How Otto revived Ghanas 2026 World Cup qualifying hopes,"The reappointment of Otto Addo on May 15, 2024, attracted mixed reactions due to the work he did in his first stint and the state of Black Stars having failed to progress from the group phase of the last two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments and especially after the Ghana Football Association (GFA) failed to stick to the criteria that was spelt in search of a new gaffer after Chris Hughton was dismissed.


The FA’s decision to boldly hand over the senior national team to Otto Addo for the 2022 World Cup playoffs against rivals, Nigeria was surprising and attracted criticisms and skepticism among football fans. Despite working as a talent coach and a scout for Borussia Dortmund, Otto Addo in a video released by the country’s football governing body, and his technical team declared their readiness for the game and assured to steer the team to qualification for the Mundial in Qatar.


Indeed, the first leg of the playoff at the Baba Yara Stadium saw thousands of football fans showing up to cheer the team up against the Super Eagles and despite the game-ending goalless, there was a seeming belief that the Black Stars could travel to Abuja and shock their West African neighbours. Masterfully, Otto Addo paraded a squad that secured a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes of football which propelled Ghana to secure its fourth global showpiece ticket.


After the results, Akufo Addo, personally called Otto Addo and jokingly told him he was going to be camped and would not return to Germany but after several talks and discussions, the 43-year-old accepted to lead the Black Stars to the Mundial in the Gulf country alongside Chris Hughton as technical advisor with George Boateng and Mas-Ud Didi Dramani as assistant coaches, the same set-up for the 2022 FIFA World Cup final play-off matches against Nigeria.


Ahead of the tournament, Otto Addo dominated the headlines for the wrong reasons after dropping key players who were on form in their respective clubs. The likes of Jeffery Schlupp, Joseph Paintsil, and Bernard Tekpetey, among other players were all dropped. However, Addo’s attempt to justify his decision that players were invited based on KPIs were criticized by the media and football enthusiasts.




With the hopes of replicating 2010’s feat in South Africa, Ghana suffered a group phase elimination after recording a win against South Korea and defeats against Portugal and Uruguay respectively. Following the Black Stars’ collapse, Otto Addo addressing the media confirmed he will not continue to lead the team as head trainer. Addo’s unexpected decision came as shock to the team and the entire country.


With the hope and anticipation of building on what Otto Addo has left behind, Chris Hughton, who was part of the technical team was elevated to take charge of the team on a 21-month contract. Having had spells in the Premier League, Hughton was expected to improve the team but fans constantly expressed their displeasure about the style and pattern of play of the team. In football, you can play beautifully and win or lose. In the same manner, you can play scrappy and ugly and still manage to win or lose but football fans struggled to see any of these under Chris Hughton.


Having manoeuvred to steer the Black Stars to book qualification for the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Ivory Coast, multiple reports emerged that Hughton would be sacked before the AFCON kicks off. However, it is believed that highly ranked personalities in government kicked against the pending decision of the Ghana Football Association (GFA).


After losing to Cape Verde and drawing with Egypt and Mozambique respectively, Ghana had to pack out after finishing Group B with two points. The Executive Council after the final group game against Mozambique conveyed a meeting at the premises of the Alassane Ouattara Ebimpé Olympic Stadium and shortly, a statement was released confirming the sacking of Hughton.




Following the arrival of the team and officials, the Ghana FA announced that they have initiated the process of appointing a new head trainer for the senior national team with the criteria spelt out. After weeks of intense work by the search committee led by Mark Addo, who is the vice president of the Ghana Football Association (GFA) settled on Otto Addo as the new head coach of the team for the second time despite over 500 coaches applying for the vacant role with Maxwell Konadu and Michael Osei also joining the queue for the vacant job.


After Otto Addo’s appointment was announced, President of the FA, Kurt Okraku praised the committee for the hard work and said Otto Addo was exceptional during the interview process.


“Otto was exceptional in the interview process and was rated highly by the search committee, hence the decision,” Okraku told ghanafa.org


“There were some brilliant individuals among the coaches who applied for the job, so the committee took the pain to interview a chunk of them to pick their thoughts on their intentions to transform the team within a short period of time due to our peculiar situation.




“The Committee was overly satisfied with Otto’s performance for which reason he was recommended to the Executive Council for approval,” President Okraku added.


Having recorded a 33.33% win rate in his first spell as Black Stars coach in 12 games, many football fans expressed their frustrations and disappointment. The criticisms intensified when Otto Addo failed to win any of the two friendly games against Nigeria and Uganda played in March. The Black Stars suffered a 2-1 defeat against the Super Eagles before being held to a 2-2 drawn game against the Cranes of Uganda.


With the 2026 World Cup qualifiers coming up next against Mali and the Central African Republic, several football fans had lost hope in Black Stars' chances of qualifying for the Mundial which will be hosted in the USA, Canada and Mexico having already recorded a hard-fought 1-0 win against Madagascar and a surprising 1-0 defeat against Comoros.


However, Otto Addo has steered the Black Stars to record back-to-back wins and scored six goals in the two games played in Bamako and Kumasi. The question is, how has Otto Addo managed to revive Ghana’s qualification chances for the global showpiece in less than six months in charge? What has Otto Addo done differently in his second coming?




Here is the breakdown:



Taking bold decision on deadwoods and believing in youngsters



Before the 26-man squad was announced for the games against Mali and Central African Republic, reports emerged suggesting that Otto Addo has communicated to some senior players that he will build his team around young players with several portals revealing that Andre Ayew, specifically is not part of the squad. Astonishingly, the captain of the side, Andre Ayew was left out of the squad. Daniel Amartey, who was not injured had no place in the squad, Richard Ofori, who has been recently released by Orlando Pirates was also left out. It is however imperative to highlight that players like Inaki Williams, Daniel Kofi Kyere, Majeed Ashimeru and other six players were left out due to various degrees of injuries as said by Otto Addo.


Speaking on the reason specifically why Andre Ayew had no place in his squad for the games, Otto Addo revealed that he visited Andre personally to inform him about his decision but Andre did not seem happy about it. This move by Otto Addo confirms the earlier media reports.


“I had a long talk with Andre. Personally, I visited him and gave him the reasons why he is not in the squad at the moment. For me, I can say I don’t like to give information out about what we spoke about,” Addo said.




“At the moment, Andre is a living legend of Ghana. It’s unbelievable what he did for the country and it’s the most difficult decision because I like him as a person and also as a player.


“And this is a decision we took, not like he necessarily agreed but I gave him the explanation so I don’t want to take it to another extent and say something for people to write about. I still have big respect for him.”


The decision by Otto Addo obviously did not go down well with some football fans but it paid off by parading young players for the games. Ghana’s starting XI in the 2021 and 2023 AFCON tournaments had an average age of 27.7 years but failed to win a game which led to the exit of the team at the group phase back to back. Otto Addo’s first two games following his reappointment were against Nigeria and Uganda and despite failing to win against the Super Eagles and the Cranes of Uganda in the friendly games in March, Otto Addo kept faith in these young players. His starting XI for games against Mali and CAR, the team had an average of 25.5. This indicates that the average age of the team has been reduced by the introduction of young players. With this decision by Otto Addo to stick with youngsters, it can be guaranteed that there would be a consistent call-up in this new Black Stars.


After the back-to-back wins against Mali and CAR, Otto Addo pleaded that these young players must be given the time to grow and adapt to the system he wants to play.




“Rome wasn’t built in a day. It takes time to build a team and we will need time. We have young players who will grow and adapt.”


Having paid close attention to Otto Addo’s interview with TV3 and Starr FM, I can conclude that deadwoods are not coming into this team again. However, with Otto Addo believing in his decisions and judgments, it is obvious that the deadwoods will be out of the Black Stars as he seeks to build a new team with new energy.


And like Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu said, Otto Addo is the new head coach and his decisions and judgements must be respected and welcomed.



Passing the first two tests



Having recorded a 1-0 win against Madagascar at the Baba Yara Stadium and a shocking 1-0 defeat to Comoros in Moroni, the chances of the Black Stars to secure a fifth ticket for the Mundial came under scrutiny with thousands of football fans calling for the head of Chris Hughton.




With Ghana now sitting 4th with just three points before the trip to Mali in the matchday three games of the qualifiers, Otto Addo during his presser admitted that it will be a tough game but also hinted that they had a plan to win the biggest game in Group I. Despite the Eagles taking the lead in the first half through Kamory Doumbia, Otto Addo kept faith in his players and rallied them along and finally had the equalizer through Ernest Nuamah who headed home Salis Samed's cross. With the game seeming to be ending in a stalemate, Jordan Ayew, who was introduced in their second half grabbed the winner as the Black Stars secured the all-important win. The trip to Bamako was described as the biggest test for Otto Addo and his backroom staff but he masterminded a win away for the first time in 2022.


The Black Stars now hosted Central African Republic (CAR) at the Baba Yara Stadium in the matchday four games. After the win in Bamako, the players were beaming with confidence with the entire football circle dreaming of back-to-back wins under Otto Addo for many years. Indeed, Otto Addo rung changes in his starting lineup against CAR but secured a thrilling 4-3 win against Raoul Savoy’s side with Jordan Ayew grabbing the headlines with a superlative hat trick.


The wins have propelled Ghana to the 2nd spot with nine points with a goal difference separating them and Comoros in Group I. With the lack of belief ahead of these games, Otto Addo came up with brilliant tactics and a game plan which has inspired the country’s chances of making it to the Mundial.



Solving goal-scoring woes



The Black Stars under CK Akonnor, Milovan Rajevac and Chris Hughton struggled to score goals and failed to win games. In the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon, the Black Stars scored just three goals in three matches and failed to win any game. In the last edition of the AFCON in Ivory Coast, Ghana scored five goals in three games and again failed to win any. The Black Stars under Otto Addo during the 2022 global showpiece in Qatar won a game and lost two, scoring five goals in three games.


The lack of goals from the Black Stars was addressed when he met the press ahead of the Mali and CAR games. Before the games, Ghana failed to win any of their friendly games against Nigeria and Uganda in March with the team losing 2-0 to the Super Eagles and a 2-2 drawn game against the Cranes.


However, Addo promised to fix the goal-scoring challenge of the Black Stars.


“We will work on our goal-scoring challenge. Every game is different, but we will try our best to ensure we score more goals.”


I admit that fixing the goal-scoring woes of the senior national team cannot be done overnight but will need intense work and discipline, but the Black Stars scoring six goals in two games is something remarkable. However, Otto Addo must address the defensive challenges and errors of the team.


Conceding four goals in two games is not a good sign of a good team but like he said after the game against CAR, this is a team he is building and they will need time to grow and adapt to playing formula. Game by game, Otto will hope to fine-tune his tactics and team cohesion which will aid his side to be potent upfront and defensively solid.



Getting the 12th man along



This is the same Black Stars Ghanaian football fans years back declined to support. However, football is not football without fans. We witnessed teams struggling globally to win home games without their fans during the era of COVID-19. After the Baba Yara Stadium was filled to its capacity against Nigeria during the 2022 World Cup playoffs, the Black Stars have struggled to attract the same number of fans due to their uninspiring performances at major tournaments.


However, after the win in Bamako, over 50,000 fans were eager to watch the game Central African Republic at the Baba Yara Stadium. Over 40,000 fans had access to watch the game with the rest of the fans left at the premises of the stadium which caused huge traffic in Kumasi. The fans were awarded with a 4-3 win.


Even when the team Black Stars were losing 2-1, the fans kept chanting and rallied the team to secure the win. This clearly means that when the Black Stars are performing well, thousands of fans will troop in to watch the team and for the national team to excel, they will need the 12th man at the stadium. With the perfect start of Otto Addo, we can only hope that the Black Stars will keep performing to attract the fans as they keep on fighting to secure a ticket for the Mundial in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

Fathers Day in trouble  Occasional Kwatriot Kwesi Yankah,"Last Sunday, Father’s Day, I had a special dialogue with friends and followers at the Coltrane Jazz Club, where I read excerpts on fatherhood, from my memoirs, The Pen at Risk. Before my readings, I gave a Father’s Day version of ‘Fellow Ghanaians,’ which I reproduce here for all. ‘Let me welcome you all to this special Father’s Day dialogue.


This is the day Mummy has made to pamper Daddy. So to everybody here, I wish you a Happy Father’s Day.


But allow me to make a few worrying observations about this day. How come we had to do extra publicity and buy extra space to announce this special occasion: ringing a bell, and beating drums throughout social media to remind everybody, Breaking News: Today is Father’s Day ooo! It was clearly not the same with mothers last month, was it?


And how come on this auspicious occasion of Father’s Day, all Chinese Restaurants have been closed for fumigation? As for Gift shops, owners and attendants have all left for a funeral or thanksgiving service; and Ghana has even decided that should Ghanaians be asked to choose one auspicious day for Dumsor, it should be Father’s Day. I wonder why. You may also have observed that since morning, Father’s Day well wishes you and I have received are only from colleague Fathers, who have had mercy upon one another knowing how lonely the world can be.


But let me not discriminate against Mothers.




The world has come a long way, from Trotro vehicle inscriptions in the 1980s such as ‘Girls are bad Boys are Good;’ ‘Fear Woman and Play with Snake.’





By the way, how do men refer to their wives at home? Happily, it is not as rude as ‘Hey my wife!,’ and she responds, ‘Yees, Me kunu.’ Indeed the world is kinder than that, and we use terms of endearment even if unwillingly. Most of the time she calls us ‘Daddy,’ isn’t it?


Fortunately, she does not say: ‘Roman Father, can you give me chop money today!’ But I have colleagues whose husbands refer to them by their first name: So then Father says, ‘Aggie’ and she responds ‘Yes Daddy.’


This means we have arrogated to ourselves the right to call wives by their first name but expect them to respond nicely with ‘Yees Daddy.’ The situation got tricky when this 45-year-old man married his former student of 20. 




She was Jennifer. When they started living together, it took a while for the poor girl to adjust to the new situation, and use appropriate terms of endearment. In the first week, Man would call wife: Jennifer!!, No response, apparently unsure of the most appropriate reply.


When the man yelled louder, ‘Jennifer….,’. Jennifer’s response to her husband was ‘Sirrr.’ That was probably for the attention of Director General GES. But the most extreme case was my friend Kofi, who yells his wife’s name, ‘Dina, Dinaaaa’ and Dina responds from afar, ‘Yeeees Governor!’, that was perhaps the only way to signal who was in charge.


But who is really in charge, when between Father and Mother, one of them is Mother, who is a nurse, counsellor, teacher, homework support, nutritionist, kitchen activist, family rep at PTA, and manager--- all rolled into one. But let me not forget Mummy’s biggest job of all: taking good care of you, washing your ‘pampers’ and all if you are called Daddy.


Having said this, consider how cacophonous, that famous song would have sounded if it was entitled ‘Sweet Father,’ or ‘Sweet Grandpa!’




And men, please if there are pets in your household particularly wild dogs, watch out. On the family’s return home from shopping, you may observe your dogs wagging their tails, warmly fussing over Mummy, and pretending not to have seen the Daddy of the House.


Colleague Fathers, ‘forewarned is to be forearmed.’ In the event of armed robbery, don’t expect your howling dogs to rush and protect you first because you are King. 


Your dogs’ priority will be the hand that feeds them; it’s the feeding hand dogs protect, and make sure they do not bite. As for the hand that provided the chop money, each one for himself and God for us all.


Fellow fathers, to avoid security risks, let’s take on the responsibility of feeding the wild dogs every now and then, but we should never trust them, but still watch our fingers! Try all the same or else, barking dogs may conspire with intruders and wreak vengeance one day.




But in all this, let women have mercy on us, and not be tempted to abandon the kitchen, leaving the evening’s dinner to us in the name of ‘Today is Mother’s Day I will not cook.’ 





The consequences that day may amount to Daddy’s intervention in the kitchen, and Mother’s Day may produce runny stomachs.


For many fathers, the closest to cooking they have ever done is gari soakings in secondary school, which they may be compelled to volunteer for the family any time Mummy is indisposed.


Happy Father’s Day to u all.




But you may ask why I chose the Coltrane Jazz Club to have this Father’s Day Dialogue.


It is because the barman is a celebrated Father, and indeed the most grassroots celebrity ever. He is a fellow Viking, by which I refer to past students of clearly the best hall of residence in the world: Mensah Sarbah Hall. Yet if you should look in the register of Sarbah past students, you may be disappointed you did not find his name.


In the whole wide world, there is only one ‘Tom Sawyer of Africa,’ named after the original fiction character, created by Mark Twain. If anybody asked you those days, to look for a Legon student called Nana Amo Adade Boamah I, it would be a wild goose chase. If, on the other hand, you were looking for one Tom Sawyer, even rodents of Sarbah Hall would lead you to Room 401 of the Okponglo Republic. 


But besides playful mischief and boyish pranks, Tom is a great personality you would love to meet anywhere, particularly at this clubhouse.




He is a Humphrey Fellow; and has a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science, plus a Master’s degree in International Trade. He was once the CEO of the Ghana National Procurement Agency.


He has been MD of Cocoa Merchants Ghana, and even once contested for a seat as a board member of the World Cocoa Foundation. 


With all these credentials, Tom in his retirement is an executive Barman and owner of the Coltrane Jazz Club, Adenta. As for his official name and title, Nana Amo Adade-Boamah I, let me lament for the records, that he is perhaps the only Nana who has not invited anyone to an Akwasidae in the past 50 years.


But on this special day, let me declare Nana Amo Adade-Boama I, ‘Tom Sawyer’ as my chosen ‘Father of the Year 2024.’




A Happy Father’s Day to everybody!

"Kwaku Asante writes: Does this country have a red line, and where do we draw it?","Some things happen in a country that keeps you wondering where the principles of that nation are and whether it has one at all.


But this country gives you multiple episodes of that almost every week - you have to question whether you live in the real world or you're just simply utopian.


Take recent news that a health facility dumped an accident victim, with POP cast on both legs in the bush until she died. It is the most senseless thing that could happen but it did, not much a place than a hospital.


But this country has moved on, it is not as much a scandal because the political class have decided it's not worth it. A few social media posts here and there and that's it, ""let's get back to other important business."" No Presidential statements like we did when it was George Floyd in the US, not even faux outrage promising action. No high-level visits to the hospital where this barbarity is alleged to have occurred - nothing.


For now, we seem to have taken a statement from the Ghana Health Service that is truly not worth the paper it's written on, as something to hold on to. We wanted to move on and we have. We may never revisit this to really learn what truly happened and who must be held to account.




And then you have a pliant media, that also treats this like any other story and in two days it's out of the news. No real coverage, seriously. I'm a journalist, I work with a media house and in a newsroom, so I don't say this lightly, but our coverage of this story and others similar have just been abysmal.


You're left wondering, where really does this nation draw the line when it comes to its citizens? Do we ever draw the line at all? On anything? What kind of country allows such injustice to pass without critical action?


Then a few days later, you read in the Fourth Estate the story about two citizens, one woman and a man, unrelated but sharing a story of how brutal this State deals with its poor - rounded up by quite clearly rogue Police, on just baseless charges, without legal representation, either completely or some stages of the legal process, thrown up in jail for months until an NGO walks in to get them freed. And it's not a big discussion, not even in the media.


It's almost as though our society has grown absolutely numb to some of these issues or are we just really a heartless bunch of people? This country offers almost nothing to its citizens.




When it comes to the US, there's something ingrained in all of our minds - that country will stop at nothing to protect its citizens, even if it's one, especially overseas. Doesn't matter much that we have all seen the depraved selectivity with which they pursue such goals on some occasions - when it comes to Palestinian Americans for instance. But still, that's a country that stands for something, that is a people with a red line.


In Ghana, we don't seem to have any - not when it comes to Madam Akua Denteh, or Madam Yednboka Keena when they are stoned to death, murdered by people they called their neighbours on allegations of witchcraft. Or even the case of the pregnant woman who had to die because the Ambulance Service decided to hold her and her husband to ransom demanding money for fuel. She died, MPs pretended to investigate the matter, I covered this, and there has been nothing on it, years on. We all just moved on, waiting for the next one to occur - I hope not to someone you and I hold dear.


Every one of these stories tells a story about how we value lives and our citizens in this country, especially when it comes to the poor. We must do better, as a people, as a collective, this country must stand for something.

"Kwesi Yankah: Remebering P.A.V. Ansah, my mentor and friend","On 14th June, 1993, 31 years ago, the celebrated Director of the School of Communication Studies at Legon was gone, having left a huge academic legacy, and ended his role as a supreme martyr of Ghana’s press freedom.


Ever since he launched his journalistic career in 1968 at University of Ghana, Professor P.A.V. Ansah persistently railed at military dictatorships in very prickly jargon, and Rawlings’ PNDC was no exception. He was instrumental in elevating both the revered Legon Observer fortnightly and the Catholic Standard weekly to their zenith. The two newspapers were either banned or pressured to fold up by the PNDC government. But he was also columnist for several other newspapers in the early 1990s before he departed. Incidentally at 27, I was a columnist for the great Catholic Standard, whose editorial board PAVA pivoted.


At the University of Ghana where we became neighbors, I took to Uncle Paul partly due to his admirable writing style, but also he made me comfortable sharing with him one peculiar trait: we were both left-handed. In a culture-sensitive environment where lefties wrap ceremonial cloths in ways others considered clumsy, any such alliance of ‘eccentrics’ was valuable.


All I needed to do during funerals at Legon, was to look around for P.A.V. and quietly sit by him. In case of any commotion by purists, my senior brother would stoutly rise to our defense as odd fellows. When I was appointed Dean of Students at the University of Ghana in the early 1990s, Paul and I got closer, but that was also because he had been appointed as the Master of Akuafo Hall, and needed to discuss student affairs in close set-ups. But there were other matters. Paul would occasionally hobble his way to my office to discuss words he badly needed to sharpen his arsenal and blast dictators in his media write ups. “The People’s Dean, the People’s Dean,” that’s how he called me in his last days, as he trudged cautiously towards the Dean of Students quadrangle. “The People’s Dean, as a linguist please help me to translate these words into English.”


Yes, and what were these?




“The People’s Dean, how do you translate into English the Fanti word, ehua: those children from poor homes who always wanted a little of the food we were eating. How would you translate ehua into English?’ Together we would search through the English lexicon checking words like ‘parasite,’ ‘beggar’ ‘indigent,’… ‘scrounging,’ to no avail. Paul simply said the word was likely to be culture bound, and that there was probably no ehua in England, since the Queen made sure all her children had enough to eat. Asked why he was giving a hell to tyrants in Africa, Paul’s answer was a proverb: “A child who complains too often about stomach ache will see that the enema syringe will have frequent contacts with his somewhere…” (SƐ abofra yƐ me yamu kaw me, me yamu kaw me pii a, bƆntoa mmpa n’ewiei da…)


News of his death in 1993 billowed across the globe. In a day or two, it swept through the airwaves in Norway, France, Kenya, Germany, Botswana, the world. In a Third World where repression-happy regimes were on the prowl for abrasive critics, the conclusion was foregone: P. A. V. Ansah, the celebrated Professor and writer was killed. This was the conjecture of many who heard the news. The state-owned media did not help to abate fears. Their coverage was suspiciously laconic.


But Paul Ansah could easily have been a target to wish away. His acupuncturist, one of the physicians Paul was visiting indeed insisted Paul was not a serious diabetic. “I would rather say he died from unnatural causes,” He also hinted that Paul expressed the fear he might be poisoned if he visited Korle Bu Hospital, and that each time Paul visited his Clinic, he could notice the presence of unusual loafers whom he personally knew.


A great writer and certainly one of the most prolific in the history of Ghanaian journalism was gone; but the state-owned media hushed his departure in a few drab paragraphs. Even the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation in their announcement, forgot a landmark Ansah registered in their own history: their golden jubilee lectures P.A.V. Ansah gave in 1985. His brand of scathing journalism made foes for him inside and outside the perimeters of power. He had received letters and phone calls threatening his life, as hinted by his wife. But illness in his last days made him even more vulnerable: a cocktail of stroke, diabetes, hypertension.




Monday 31st May, 1993. Sitting beside him in his last days, I had with me a questionnaire I long planned administering to him. I had scheduled that mini project for June, for I realized P.A.V.A. in print was little known by his readers beyond being a jolly good brain, always breathing down the neck of the Jerry Rawlings Government.


“Kwesi, I don’t know what I ate today I shouldn’t have eaten; but I feel very very weak,” he said. I said not to worry “Go back to bed. Uncle Paul, I will come another time.”


That was the last I personally saw of Paul Ansah.


On our return from Paul’s burial, Kwame Karikari, Audrey Gadzekpo and I thought the best tribute we could pay our friend was to compile his writings into a book, which was soon published, and relaunched in November 2013, titled Going to Town: The Writings of P.A.V. Ansah.




Soon after his burial something else happened. I had received an unusual visitation from an eminent public figure and business magnate. The man I highly revered told me he noticed a big vacuum in a great newspaper Paul was writing for. On his demise that had implications for the future of the newspaper. Could I take up a column in that paper as a successor to P. A.V.A? The terms for that would be discussed.


I did not even blink an eye and politely said no out of respect and reverence for my good friend P.A.V.A. I simply refused to be a replacement or fill a vacuum a good friend had left.


If anything, I felt duty-bound to help perpetuate the vacuum, and not attempt to blot my friend out of memory.


P.A.V.A. was and still is, irreplaceable.

Enimil Ashon: Et tu Dampare? IGP is breaking my heart,"I saw the headline on Wednesday: 'Amenfi East NPP PC arrested over galamsey comment’. The story was that the police had invited the NPP Parliamentary Candidate in Amenfi East who was recorded inciting illegal miners to beat any security officer who attempted to stop them from doing their work.


News of the arrest gave me no comfort. I am a Ghanaian, and when it comes to dealing with crimes against the political class, especially officials of ruling governments, Ghanaians are like God: we know the end from the beginning. They are saying that the man will be freed.


I will return to this topic later.


For now, I want to spill some ink on the re-arrest and detention of Phillis Naa Koryoo Okunor, NDC parliamentary candidate for the Awutu Senya East Constituency.


My senior colleague journalist, Frank Apeagyei, can tell the number of times I have expressed the desire to get the IGP, Dr George Akuffo Dampare, for an interview. I am not the oldest Ghanaian alive, but who in this country ever dreamed that a police headquarters, the type we had known since 1957, could transform into the five-star edifice Dampare has made it?




I did not know what to think when live on television, he shed tears. That teary conduct earned him a good place in the hearts of 90%-plus Ghanaians.


Elsewhere, tears dropping from the eyes of a public officer or seeker for public office are interpreted as a sign of weakness. In the US, of all places on earth, support for Senator Edmund Muskie, an early favourite to win the Democratic presidential primaries, waned and dipped because on February 26, 1972, newspapers reported that at a public event, he had ""tears streaming down his face."" 


That finished him. Of course, long after he had been thus compelled to bow out of the presidential race, his enemies later acknowledged that the ""tears"" could have been melting snow!


Americans are a different kettle of fish. In Ghana, a public officer in tears will melt hearts. Some people are convinced that there has been an IGP like Dampare.




That bubble has been punctured. His handling of the latest assignment has raised a big question mark over his inherent goodness.  


I want to believe that the IGP had not read the docket. Why was she being re-arrested after the first arrest and her statement taken by police in the constituency?


In all good conscience, was this lady a criminal? It is alleged that she was carrying an unlicensed gun. It has turned out that the gun was licensed. It is alleged that it was in another person’s name, but it is emerging that the name on the permit had been wrongly spelt and that the wrong spelling was the fault of the police officer who wrote out the licence.


At any rate, why must someone with a gun she hadn’t used be arrested, re-arrested and detained overnight when only a few years ago, in 2020, another Parliamentary Candidate, Hawa Koomson, did not only possess a gun but actually discharged it in a crowded place? How many minutes did Hawa Koomson spend at the police station when she was invited?




Is the IGP aware but there is a popular song which is a eulogy to Dampare’s greatness as an IGP?


He stands the danger of losing all this love. The handling of this assignment gives the man in the street the unavoidable feeling that “Dampare is not different, after all”.


Why should a great officer like him lose such beautiful credentials just to please political power? Once upon a time, in the mid-1960s, a civilian Minister of Information in the National Liberation Council military government resigned because the military Head of State, General Ankrah, sacked the Editors of Ghanaian Times and Daily Graphic. He resigned because he felt it was wrong to fire an editor for only doing their work.


Danpare is a chartered accountant holding a PhD. He completed his ACCA in 1996 aged 25. He holds two Master of Science degrees in Accounting & Finance and Business Systems




Would he starve if he resigned today on principle?


Most importantly, can he look Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit in the eyes come Sunday? Now back to the story of the arrested Amenfi East NPP PC.  


Hear him: “We (NPP) have cancelled Operation Galamstop and the soldiers who have been tormenting you. So, officially, neither the military nor any security operative currently wields the power to stop anyone from engaging in illegal mining.” Present was the Western Regional Minister, Kwabena Okyere Darko Mensah.


All because an election is coming up and NPP must not lose in Galamsey constituencies as they did in 2000. When I heard Bawumia promise that “we will not burn your Galamsey equipment”, I knew that it had come to the wire!




Akufo-Addo’s appointees have soon forgotten that by taking power into their own hands, galamseyers killed Major Mahama. In a confrontation between officials of AngloGold Ashanti and galamseyers on an AGA concession on February 6, 2016, John Owusu, a communication strategist with the company, was killed.


It’s a shame.

"Dr Chaka Uzondu: For a green tomorrow in Ghana, take peasant agroecology to scale","We celebrated Green Ghana Day on 7 June. The goal for 2024 was to plant 10 million tree seedlings. The President also reminded us that this was not about one day. President Akufor-Addo is quoted as saying, “Let us go out, not only to plant trees, but grow them for a ‘green tomorrow.’ This is a duty we owe not only to the current generation but to generations yet to come.”


It seems that for the President the end goal of Green Ghana Day is about a “Green Tomorrow.” Is a Green Tomorrow fundamentally concerned with climate justice? What does a Green Tomorrow look like?  


Ending the use of chemical pesticides must be a part of Ghana’s Green Tomorrow agenda. Pesticides contribute to climate change. That is, the making, packaging, transporting and application of pesticides all contribute to climate change because of their use of fossil fuels.  Indeed, pesticides may have more negative impacts on the environment than chemical fertilizers. 


Research reveals that on average it takes 10 times more energy to produce one kilogram of pesticide than of chemical fertilizer. Currently, we are inadequately attentive to the negative role of pesticides on climate change and our environment. Yet, if a country is serious about reducing the contribution of agriculture to climate change, then putting an end to the use of pesticides must be a priority.


Ending the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers must be part of Ghana’s Green Tomorrow agenda. Chemical fertilizers are heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their manufacture. This process gives off carbon dioxide which is one of the main causes of climate change. Chemical fertilizers also produce greenhouse gases (GHG) when used. One of these GHGs is nitrous oxide. Apparently, it ”warms the planet 300 times more than carbon dioxide.”  




Where there is the use of chemical fertilizers, there is often the problem of excessive nitrogen in the environment. For example, nitrogen in the form of nitrates can contaminate groundwater. Indeed, nitrogen pollution is now a major challenge confronting the planet. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, “Nitrogen pollution is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss on the planet, after habitat destruction and greenhouse gas emissions.” It is up to the people of Ghana to champion the phasing out of synthetic chemical fertilizers, since they are inimical to a truly Green Tomorrow.


A Green Tomorrow in Ghana can only be realized if we scale up peasant agroecology. Adding the “peasant” before the agroecology is critical. It is to highlight that what we need is for the rights of peasants e.g. smallholder farmers and landless farmers to be prioritized in any agroecological transition. For guidance, we can be informed by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas.  Anything claiming to be “agroecology,” which fails to substantively address the rights of peasants fails the litmus test. That is not what we need.


For a Green Tomorrow, Ghana needs a progressive transformation of our food and agriculture system aligned to peasant agroecology.  Therefore, a Green Tomorrow in Ghana cannot be achieved by industrializing Ghanaian agriculture. Bigger farms, fewer farmers, utilizing hybrid and/or genetically modified seeds in vast monocultures achieving the desired application of fossil fuel-based fertilizers used per acre of land, cannot create a green tomorrow in Ghana.  


Remember, the agri-food system is already responsible globally for about 31 per cent of human-caused GHG emissions because it is so reliant on fossil fuels. Critically, most of the increase in these emissions comes from activities such as producing chemical fertilizers and packaging. A Green Tomorrow in Ghana is not going to be realized by so-called “precision agriculture” either. Precise drone-based spraying of pesticides, precisely where they are needed, will still kill pollinators imprecisely. Precise application of precise doses of precisely mixed fossil fuel-based fertilizers for precise soil conditions for a precise variety of a crop grown in monoculture is precisely the problem. We need systemic change.




If we want a Green Tomorrow in Ghana, then we need to take peasant agroecology to scale. With peasant agroecology, we will redesign the food system around values such as equity and solidarity. With peasant agroecology, we will halt and reverse land degradation. We will prioritize soil health and biodiversity. By systematically eliminating pesticide and inorganic fertilizers, Ghana’s agricultural lands will be revitalized, improving soil biodiversity and increasing the presence of pollinators.


With peasant agroecology, we will prioritize the rights of smallholder farmers and those working in rural areas. With peasant agroecology, we will prioritize feeding people local, nutritious, culturally appropriate foods and protecting the environment over the making of profits. We will realise dignified livelihoods for those in rural areas. With peasant agroecology, we will also reclaim our indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing and being. We will reject neoliberal thought and its relentless pursuit of profits and growth. A Green Tomorrow in Ghana requires that we reject the commodification of nature.


Let us go out, not only to plant trees but to realize a Green Tomorrow – Ghana has an equitable and sustainable food system, which satisfies everyone’s right to nutritious and culturally appropriate food free of agro-toxins; smallholder farmers live dignified lives; food is produced in harmony with nature and promotes soil health and biodiversity; food circuits have been strengthened and shortened, so people eat fresh agroecologically produced food. Post-harvest loss and food waste are a thing of the past. Forest reserves are free of all mining and prospecting. Verdant parks, well maintained are the norm. Ghana is synonymous with peasant agroecology and food sovereignty.

Collateral-free lending: A gateway to enterprise growth,"Evidence continues to mount that micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) represent the lifeblood of Ghana's economy. This view has been re-echoed not only by international organisations such as the World Bank and International Trade Centre but backed by studies conducted by local research institutions such as the University of Ghana’s Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research. These businesses play a vital role in driving economic growth, creating employment opportunities, and contributing to poverty reduction. In advancing this mandate, MSMEs would require adequate funding from financial institutions in the country. 


The ability of MSMEs to access finance with relative ease and without the requirement for collateral, therefore, has become a pivotal issue and decisive factor of inclusion and participation in the MSMEs space, especially for women and youth. Now more than ever, dealing with the challenges that hinder these businesses from accessing financial support must be of utmost concern – a central action point for all who genuinely value and seek to advance the principles of equitable and inclusive growth.


And yet, access to finance remains a major challenge for many MSMEs. Many businesses cannot raise the needed security required by banks to successfully access credit. According to the World Bank, low access to finance among Ghanaian MSMEs is worsened by the high cost of financing as the high rates of borrowing make it impossible for MSMEs to sustain profitability over the long term. By the end of the first quarter in 2023, the Interest Rate Indicator of the Bank of Ghana showed an average lending rate of 35.87% among commercial banks. 


In addition to this, recent World Bank reports have established that MSMEs face very high collateral requirements in the form of cash and cash equivalents including landed property which they mostly do not have or own. In response to these challenges outlined above, the Absa Young Africa Works project, with the support of Mastercard Foundation has taken a bold step in addressing the collateral requirement by scaling collateral-free lending. The project aims to transform access to finance for MSMEs and drive the growth of women and youth-owned businesses across the country.


Why is this important for MSMEs in Ghana?




Traditional lending practices among financial institutions often involve some form of collateral, making it somewhat difficult for MSMEs, especially those in the informal sector, to secure loans. Most banks in Ghana have had to emphasize collaterals due to widespread challenges with the creditworthiness of businesses. Across the banking landscape, only a sufficiently positive customer historic borrowing conduct can provide the required level of comfort for banks to lend instead of security.


But for most MSMEs, such financial records are often lacking. A more intentional and careful look at the situation will likely establish the fact that collateral requirements can disproportionately affect women and youth entrepreneurs who often lack the necessary assets to deposit as security. As a result of customary practices, women in some parts of Ghana are not financially capable and are not adequately supported to purchase or own properties in their own names. Young people between the ages of 20 and 25 have either not successfully run a business long enough or mobilized sufficient resources to own assets to use as collateral. Consequently, a barrier is created as many promising businesses are unable to access the capital needed to expand operations. If businesses cannot access working capital, then their growth and job creation potential cannot be confidently projected or evaluated.


Whatever the case, the fact remains that uncollateralized lending offers a lifeline to micro, small and medium enterprises by providing access to finance based on the strength of their business models, financial history, corporate governance practices and growth potential rather than tangible assets that many of these businesses lack. Building the capacity of MSMEs and supporting them to access collateral-free loans is therefore essential.


Scaling lending limits




A rapid scan of the banking landscape showed that prior to 2023 very few banks in Ghana offered unsecured business loans, and some of those that offered such products typically effected under-six-figure credit exposures. On the other hand, however, the Absa Young Africa Works project has been at the forefront of promoting collateral-free lending in Ghana with remarkable success. Since the scaling of this lending model, an increasing number of women and youth-owned businesses have been able to secure funding for their businesses. 


The project at inception in October 2020 - with the support of Absa Bank - set the lending ceiling at GH¢500,000. By the end of 2022, the Absa Young Africa Works project lifted the ceiling further up to GH¢1,000,000 which resulted in a noticeable surge in demand for lending support among MSMEs. This is because the macroeconomic challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the value of working capital for many businesses.


Figure 1 Source: Absa Young Africa Works Project


Evidence of impact


Since its commencement, the Absa Young Africa Works project has provided financial support to at least 617 MSMEs and more than 4,000 smallholder farmer businesses with a substantial portion of these businesses being owned and run by women. Overall, 91% of loans given under the project were granted with no collateral requirement. The decision to champion uncollateralized lending has yielded remarkable results for women and youth-owned businesses across Ghana. At least 67% of collateral free loans provided under the project supported businesses owned by women. 




Semer Prime Enterprise, a woman-owned business dealing in the sale of plastic products in the Bono East region of Ghana recorded over 300% growth in revenue less than one year after accessing financial assistance from the Absa Young Africa Works project. We found this remarkable for a business whose owner had earlier expressed apprehension about getting a loan to expand her business. She became convinced and availed her business for financial support only after learning about the subsidized interest rate of 10% and collateral-free loan package made possible by the Absa Young Africa Works project.


There is even more impact arising from the dramatic uptick in MSME borrowing interest after the project revised upward the lending limit for unsecured loans. One year after the project was incepted, only four youth-led businesses had approached the project for financial assistance, receiving less than GH¢500,000 in total. By the second year of the project, at least 662 youth including smallholder farmers had received financial support. 


As the lending limit was augmented further to GHC1M, interest in business expansion increased, and so did the number of MSMEs double by the end of the third year. As of now - 7 months into year 4 of the project - more than 2,000 young people have been financially supported. In effect, a major lesson for the Absa Young Africa Works project is the significant impact of raising the collateral-free lending ceiling from GH¢500,000 to GH¢1,000,000, particularly in driving the surge in participation from women and youth-owned businesses.


The Absa Young Africa Works project has gender and inclusion dynamics cutting across all stages of our change theory and implementation strategy. Collateral-free lending further sheds light on the importance of inclusivity, which begins with stimulating the interest and confidence of our target MSMEs in accessing low-cost working capital, although these businesses would ordinarily rather avoid loans. Notably, 96% of female business owners, many of whom previously had apprehensions and were unsure about their capacity to repay loans, have now, on average returned at least twice to access collateral-free funding from Absa Bank. 




We have found that effectively engaging unbanked MSMEs and providing easy and expanded access to needed capital generates interest and leads to business growth, and with growth comes sustainable livelihoods, especially for Ghanaian women and youth. Business partners of some beneficiaries have testified of the notable growth over the past three years facilitated by the Absa Young Africa Works project.


“We supply Adom Agro with fertilizer as well as pest and weed control products. In the past 6 months, I can say there has been like 60-70% increase in purchase requests by Adom Agro which is a huge jump compared to previous years. I think her growth has been tremendous because when she started, I was here. She had only one shop, but now has many of them. She is now among my top two clients in Bono East, Bono and Ahafo regions combined,” said Daniel Timpabi, Sales Agronomist, Dizengoff Ghana – Techiman)


Sustaining the gains


There is no doubt that inclusive economic growth is possible for MSME business owners, and the success of the Absa Young Africa Works project's uncollateralized lending initiative re-echoes this need to reimagine traditional Ghanaian lending practices toward more inclusive approaches. Impact investors, financial institutions, and policymakers must become more intentional in recognising the potential of uncollateralized lending models as a viable mechanism for MSME development in Ghana. 




As of March 2024, the project has maintained a healthy loan portfolio with only a 0.1% default rate. This is proof that collateral-free MSME financing is feasible with minimal risk of loan non-performance. Hence, impact investors seeking to catalyse true and lasting transformation in the human condition should consider incorporating this lending model into their strategies to support the growth of MSMEs.


We hold the view that to unleash the full potential of MSMEs and build a more resilient economy through revenue growth and sustainable job creation, we need to transform the financing landscape; we need to embrace innovative solutions including various unsecured lending models which have shown real potential as enablers of inclusion, participation, and revenue growth in the MSME sector. 


The evidence clearly shows that for Ghanaian MSMEs, meticulous collateral-free lending is one key and proven way to go, and as we continue on this path, we can have confidence in our collective contribution to building Ghana’s future together, one MSME story at a time.

Dr Adesina: Envisioning Africas economic prospects,"A lot has happened since I was elected in 2015 and re-elected for a second term in 2020, with 100% of the votes of all 81 shareholder countries, African and non-African.


At the Annual Meetings of the African Development Bank Group, held last week in Nairobi, Kenya, our shareholders unanimously approved an additional $117 billion increase in the capital of the African Development Bank.


This follows the earlier general capital increase which raised the capital of the African Development Bank from $93 billion to $201 billion in 2019.


The new capital injection last week brings the capital of the African Development Bank to $318 billion.


We will be bigger, bolder and better.




The historic increase in our financial capacity shows the confidence of the shareholders in African Development Bank’s vision for Africa, and our resolve and commitment to accelerate its growth and development.


They did so because our High 5s priority programs (Light Up and Power Africa; Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; Integrate Africa; and improve the quality of life of the people of Africa) have already impacted on over 400 million people in the last eight years.


The newly injected capital will allow us to do more.


It is therefore, with the excitement of the wind in the sails of the African Development Bank, that I am delighted to speak to you today on “Envisioning Africa’s Economic Prospects”.




The New York Times recently had as its headlines: the future is African.


I agree with the New York Times. Africa can no longer be ignored. I fully expect Africa to be the pivotal continent in the world, given its economic prospects.


First, Africa’s population is projected to reach 2.5 billion by 2050 and by then one of four persons on earth will be African. With a rising middle class and projected consumer and business expenditures to reach $7 trillion, this is a formidable market of the future.


Second, with its burgeoning young population of almost a billion people under the age of 35, Africa will boom with talented skills and form the workforce for the world.




Third, with 65% of the uncultivated arable land left on earth being in Africa, what Africa does with its agriculture will determine the future of food in the world to feed the global population of 9.7 billion by 2050.


Fourth, the future of energy transition, for a world powered largely with renewable energy, will depend on Africa. Africa has the largest solar potential in the world, which will be critical for developing green hydrogen and green ammonia that will power green economies of the world towards net zero emissions. Africa also has the largest deposits of green minerals and metals, from platinum, copper, nickel, manganese, chromium, graphite and lithium, that are critical for the manufacturing of solar panels, battery energy storage systems and electric vehicles, a market estimated to rise to $57 trillion by 2050.


Fifth, the African continental free trade area, which brings together all the 54 countries in Africa, with an estimated GDP of $3.4 trillion, is on its way to becoming the largest free-trade zone in the world.


Therefore, economic trends, growth, and development of Africa are central as we look to a world where the continent will play a significant role.




Despite the challenges of the Covid pandemic, geopolitical risks, high food and energy prices, and rising global interest rates, African countries are showing economic resilience. Africa’s real GDP growth increased from 3.1% in 2022 to 3.7% in 2023 and is projected to reach 4.3% in 2025, according to the African Economic Outlook Report of the African Development Bank.


Africa is the second fastest-growing region in the world, second only to Asia, and has 10 of the 20 fastest-growing countries in the world.


As Africa’s economic resilience is bolstered, unlocking its economic prospects requires ensuring structural change of its economies, raising the productivity of agriculture, provision of electricity, accelerating infrastructure investments, supporting faster pace digitalization, unleashing economic and job opportunities for women and youth, and driving industrialization through greater mobilization of the private sector.


Assuring food security in Africa is top on the agenda for the African Development Bank. Over the past 8 years, we have provided close to $10 billion in support of agriculture. Our flagship initiative, Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), has delivered climate-smart agricultural technologies for 13 million farmers. Our support of heat-tolerant wheat varieties in Ethiopia turned it into a wheat self-sufficient country in under four years.




The African Development Bank is also developing Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones in eleven countries to support agro-industrialization and value addition and development of agricultural value chains. This is critical to unlocking the value of the food and agribusiness in Africa worth $1 trillion by 2030.


Unlocking Africa’s vast renewable energy sources and assuring energy supply, access and security, is central to Africa’s economic prosperity. Africa still has close to 600 million people without access to electricity.


Since the African Development Bank launched its New Deal on Energy in 2016, much progress has been made, with the share of the population with electricity expanded from 32% to 57%. To expand access to electricity, the African Development Bank is implementing a $20 billion initiative called Desert-to-Power, to develop 10,000 megawatts of electricity from solar across 11 countries to connect 250 million people to electricity.


During the Spring Meetings of the World Bank earlier this year, the President of the World Bank and I launched a bold joint effort to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by the World Bank and the African Development Bank by 2030.




The African Development Bank is investing heavily in human capital to unleash the growth potential of Africa, including tapping into the scientific talents in the diaspora.


We are supporting universities of science and technology, expanding training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, centers of excellence in biotechnology and material sciences, as well as technical and vocational training. We have committed $700 million for education and skills development, which has supported 4,000 tertiary education and training facilities, and provided 1.7 million African youth with access to education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.


The African Development Bank is supporting Coding for Employment Programs, providing critical digital skills in computer coding in partnership with Microsoft Philanthropies. This is essential to continue to drive the expansion of the rapidly expanding fintech industries in Africa. Africa has witnessed a tripling in the number of startups, reaching 5,200 between 2020 and 2021, as revenue of fintech companies is estimated to reach over $30 billion annually by 2025. This trend mirrors what Google and the International Finance Corporation estimate that Africa’s internet economy will reach $180 billion by 2025 and $712 billion by 2050.


Unleashing the potential of the digital economy will require large investments in digital infrastructure, including fiber optics, data centers and the expansion of mobile networks to improve connectivity.




To support the businesses of young people in Africa, and drive greater entrepreneurship, the African Development Bank is establishing Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks across the continent. These are new financial institutions that will provide tailored financial instruments to build the businesses of young people and build youth-based wealth, which will reduce migration. The first Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks have been approved for Liberia ($16 million) and Ethiopia ($32 million), with several more in the pipeline.


We are also focusing on women.


The African Development Bank’s flagship initiative, Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA), is de-risking financial institutions to lend to women. AFAWA is delivering. It is working with 169 financial institutions in 43 countries and has so far approved $1.7 billion in financing for 18,300 women-led businesses. Our goal is to mobilize $5 billion for women-led businesses.


To improve regional integration and assure the success of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area, the African Development Bank has provided close to $50 billion in support of infrastructure projects in the past 8 years. This includes the construction of roads, transport corridors, rails, ports, water and sanitation, and digital infrastructure.


To support Africa’s net zero transition, the African Development Bank has launched the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA) to mobilize $10 Billion of private financing for green infrastructure in Africa.


The African Development Bank is mobilizing more private sector investments into Africa. We supported the $24 billion LNG project in Mozambique, which will provide over $66 billion in revenue for Mozambique and make it the third largest exporter of LNG in the world. We supported the $19.5 billion Dangote Refinery Complex, which is the largest single train refinery in the world and the largest ammonia plant globally. We supported the $13 billion OCP phosphate company in Morocco, the largest phosphate fertilizer plant in the world.


A major challenge for private sector investments is risk—especially market risks, counterparty risks, exchange rate risks and political risks. To mitigate these, the African Development Bank deploys partial risk guarantees and partial credit guarantees. These are working very well and have become a significant part of our business.


For example, our EUR 195 million partial credit guarantee allowed the Republic of Benin to raise EUR 350 million from international banks and international investors, lengthening maturity from 10 to 12.5 years, at low interest at around 290 basis points below the Eurobond yield curve for similar maturities.


Our partial credit guarantee of $345 million allowed Egypt to access private capital markets, by issuing Panda bond, the first ever Panda bond issued in China by an African Sovereign. The bond issue, with 100% guarantee by the African Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, won the Sovereign, Supra and Agency bond deal of the year at the 2024 Bonds, Loans and ESG Capital Markets Awards.


Partial Risk Guarantees are being used successfully to crowd in private investors into projects with governments. The Bank is using up to $800 million in partial credit guarantee to mobilize a commercial loan of $1.35 billion for financing the 6th lot of the Standard Gauge of the railways from Tanzania, DRC and Burundi, leveraging the Bank’s resources 3.4 times.


A major challenge facing private sector is foreign currency exchange risk, which arises because of the mismatch between foreign currency denominated loans or equity investments and local currency earnings of companies or counterparties.


The Bank provides loans in eleven local currencies and deploys local currency products. In addition, the Bank uses a range of instruments to support local currency lending, including synthetic local currency loans and use of private sector FX hedging institutions such as TCX.


Portfolio managers of global institutional investors shy away from allocations to Africa, due to multiple reasons, the major ones being high-risk perceptions. African countries therefore suffer from high-risk premiums, with the cost of accessing capital on the continent being at least 3 times that of other emerging markets and developing regions.


This “Africa risk-premium” leads to underinvestment by the private sector in Africa.


But perception is not reality.


Moody’s Analytics conducted a 14-year survey on cumulative default rates on infrastructure loans in various regions of the world. The results show that default rate in Africa was 1.9%, while default rates in North America was 6.6%; Latin America, 10%; Eastern Europe, 12%; and Western Asia, 4.3%.


To support the African Development Bank to transfer risks off from its balance sheet to private institutional investors and insurance markets, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) provided the Bank with a $2 billion guarantee, which allowed the African Development Bank to free up $2 billion in new lending to support climate finance. The UK FCDO also provided a guarantee of $1 billion to free up the same level of financing for the African Development Bank to finance just energy transition for South Africa.


The Africa Investment Forum is providing a transparent platform for investors interested in Africa to meet, assess projects, evaluate risks, seek counter risk mitigants, as well as address political risks to investors. Since the establishment of the Africa Investment Forum in 2018, it has attracted investor interests to Africa worth over $180 billion.


There is no doubt that the economic prospects of Africa are strong. However, achieving them will require overcoming some significant headwinds.


At the top of this is building the resilience of the continent to climate change.


The continent loses $7–15 billion, which is expected to rise to $50 billion annually by 2030. From greater frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, no part of Africa is spared. Yet, Africa receives only 3% of global climate finance, with $30 billion annually for climate adaptation, while its needs are $277 billion annually.


The African Development Bank is supporting African countries to tackle climate change. We have significantly increased the share of climate finance in our annual lending from 9% in 2016 to 55% last year. The Bank is implementing a $25 billion initiative, the African Adaptation Acceleration Program—the largest climate adaptation program in the world—in partnership with the Global Center on Adaptation.


Another headwind is rising debt levels, with 22 countries at the risk of high debt distress.


This is especially the case as concessional financing globally has declined, with more countries depending on private commercial creditors and the Eurobond market. With Africa’s debt service payments of $74 billion due this year, up from $17 billion in 2010, urgent actions are needed on comprehensive debt treatment and resolution for Africa.


To address these headwinds, Africa will need significantly more financial resources. and for that the reform of the global financial architecture is critical.


Action is needed in five areas.


First, the G20 Common Framework on debt treatment needs to deliver much faster debt resolution for countries, to avoid a similar the “lost decade” that Africa experienced in the 1990s.


Second, the global financial architecture needs to deliver greater concessional financing for Africa. This is critical to reverse the dependence on commercial debt for development. The African Development Fund, which supports Africa’s 37 low-income countries, will need at least $25 billion for its 17th replenishment to be bolder, bigger and effective in providing much needed concessional financing for countries.


Third, the global financing system must deliver more for Africa and avoid economic divergences that slow down economic recovery of the continent in cases of global shocks. This disparity in access to financing was evident during the Covid pandemic, when developed countries provided fiscal stimulus of $19 trillion to their economies (18% of global GDP), while Africa was able to provide only $85 billion (4.5% of its GDP).


The African Development Bank is developing an African Financial Stability Mechanism to better shield African economies from liquidity shocks and build economic resilience.


Fourth, the global contingent financing system must deliver more for Africa. The $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the IMF allocated only $33 billion to Africa—or 4.5%—the continent with the greatest need.


The recent approval of the IMF Board for the use of SDRs for hybrid capital, as per the framework developed by the African Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, is a very positive development. The approved $20 billion SDR rechanneling for hybrid capital can be leveraged four times by the African Development Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and others to deliver at least $80 billion of additional financing for Africa and other regions.


Fifth, African countries need fairer access to global capital markets to reduce liquidity pressures and lower debt service payments. Fairer credit ratings for African countries can save at least $75 billion annually in debt service payments, according to the United Nations Development Program.


The trajectory for Africa will be much stronger as we tackle these challenges, as well as improve security, and expand more concessional financing and private sector financing.


At the end of the day, what will make the most difference is the mobilization of domestic resources. This will require continued strong macroeconomic and fiscal management, expanding tax revenues, reducing corruption and illicit capital flows, improving public financial management, and unlocking the huge natural capital wealth of Africa estimated at over $6.8 trillion.


The Africa we want is within reach.


We are making good progress.


With strong political will, global partnerships and regional cooperation, Africa will emerge as the pivotal continent.


An Africa critical to the future of the world.


An Africa, thriving, peaceful and prosperous.


It is a vision Africa deserves.


It is a vision we must do all to achieve.

Dr Prince Hamid Armah: A renewed commitment to ending child labour in Ghana,"As we observe the World Day Against Child Labour on June 12 themed “Let's act on our commitments: End Child Labour!”, we are reminded of our solemn duty to protect the youngest and most vulnerable members of our society. Child labour is a grave violation of human rights that robs children of their childhood, potential, and dignity. It is a pervasive issue within our borders, affecting thousands of children across Ghana. These children are often deprived of education, exposed to dangerous work environments, and subjected to physical and emotional abuse, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and social inequality that hinders our nation's progress.


Since assuming office in 2017, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government has undertaken significant measures to combat child labour. We have diligently created policies and programs aimed at addressing the root causes of child labour and providing support for affected children and their families. However, despite these efforts, challenges remain. Child labour continues to be prevalent across Ghana, particularly in rural areas and sectors such as agriculture, fishing, mining, and domestic work.


The implementation of the National Plan of Action (NPA) against Child Labour Phase II (2017-2021) marked a significant step forward. This comprehensive plan focused on strengthening legal frameworks, enhancing enforcement mechanisms, and increasing public awareness about the dangers of child labour. Through collaborative efforts with international partners, civil society organizations, and local communities, we have made substantial progress in reducing the prevalence of child labour in various sectors, particularly in agriculture, mining, and informal urban settings.


Recognizing that education is a critical tool in the fight against child labour, our government has invested heavily in the Free Senior High School (SHS) policy and other educational reforms. These initiatives aim to ensure that every child has access to quality education, thereby reducing the likelihood of children being forced into labour due to financial constraints. Additionally, we have expanded social protection programs such as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) and the Ghana School Feeding Program. These programs provide essential support to vulnerable families, enabling them to meet their basic needs without resorting to child labour as a means of survival.


Our government has also strengthened legal and institutional frameworks to protect children from exploitation and abuse. The Human Trafficking Act 2005 and the Labour Act 2003, among others, have been crucial in this regard. Additionally, we have enhanced the capacity of institutions like the Department of Social Welfare and the Ghana Police Service to effectively address cases of child labour and trafficking.




However, it is imperative that we continue to build on the progress made and address the gaps that persist. To this end, I propose the following policy recommendations to further strengthen our fight against child labour:


1. Enhanced Collaboration and Coordination:


Establish a multi-sectoral task force involving government agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, and international partners to streamline efforts and ensure a cohesive approach to eradicating child labour.


2. Increased Funding for Education and Social Services: Allocate more resources to educational programs, vocational training, and social services that support at-risk children and their families. This includes expanding the scope of the Free SHS policy to cover additional educational materials and transportation costs.




3. Community Engagement and Empowerment:


 Implement community-based programs that raise awareness about the harmful effects of child labour and empower local leaders to take active roles in protecting children. This can be achieved through training and capacity-building initiatives.


4. Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms:


Enhance the capacity of law enforcement and judicial institutions to prosecute offenders and ensure that laws against child labour are strictly enforced. This includes providing adequate resources and training to personnel involved in combating child labour.




5. Data Collection and Monitoring:


 Develop a robust system for collecting and analyzing data on child labour to inform policy decisions and track progress. Regular monitoring and evaluation will help identify areas that require additional attention and resources.


The fight against child labour is not just a governmental responsibility; it is a collective and moral duty that involves every segment of society. Parents, guardians, community leaders, educators, and the private sector all have crucial roles to play. We must foster a culture that values and protects children, ensuring they receive the care, education, and opportunities they deserve.


Let us remember that the future of our nation depends on the health, education, and well-being of our children. As we continue to implement and enhance our policies and programs, let us remain steadfast in our commitment to eradicating child labour. Together, we can build a Ghana where every child is free from exploitation and has the chance to achieve their full potential.

Kwesi Yankah: Otumfuos visit and Legons nightmare,"Saturday, 8th June, history was made when Otumfuo Osei Tutu II came down to Accra to pay a rare courtesy call on the Ga Mantse, Nii Tackie Teiko Tsuru II.


The ceremonial pomp and pageantry displayed in a dialogue of cultures was a beauty to behold, even as the nation was consoled in the search for peace, tolerance, and harmony in an election year.


I watched the grand ceremony on TV and heaved a sigh of relief looking back on a dim past when a fuming Labadi chief and elders reprimanded Legon for daring to invite Otumfuo to the University of Ghana, Labadi land.


The year was 2003. Otumfuo had spent just a few years on the Golden Stool. I was Hall Master of the great Mensah Sarbah Hall, whose credentials at the time included ‘the only hall of residence named after a human being.’


Our dream as Sarbah alumni was to propel the University’s youngest Hall far ahead of its peers; and one ‘plot’ we hatched was to invite  ‘King Solomon’ to be the Life Patron of Sarbah Alumni, and lead a fundraising ceremony towards the construction of a Viking Alumni Hostel.




The new hostel, which was eventually opened for student occupancy in 2023, has a haunting history founded on inter-ethnic tension.


Why a new hostel? Legon had a huge accommodation problem, and Sarbah alumni were anxious to show the way by lightening the burden on the Government.


Our delegation to visit Otumfuo at Manhyia and extend the invitation was a high-powered one, including the following: Kwaku Kyei, former IGP who was alumni president; Nana Adade Boamah (Tom Sawyer) Kofi Dua Adonten; Yaw Afriyie Nketia, Gloria Akuffo, Ursula Owusu, Betty Mould Iddrisu, Adu Gyimah (Castro), Lee Atoms Ofei, Ivy Heward Mills, Agyeman Badu-Akosah, Yaa Osei Brempong, Margaret Insaidoo, Maxwell Opoku Agyeman, Rosina Kyeremateng, Nana Twum (king of mpusuo) etc., indeed a whole bus load of distinguished Vikings. Happily the Viking delegation was graciously received by Otumfuo at Manhyia, and even pampered with a sumptuous dinner.


But why Otumfuo Osei Tutu as Special Guest of Honor?  He had hit the ground running as the new King of Asante in 1999, having shown remarkable interest in education. Furthermore, his inner circle was a virtual Viking enclave.




His wife Lady Julia (Amaning) was a proud Viking; the occupant of the Asante silver stool, Nana Osei Bonsu II (alias Gyimah Kessie) was a Viking, and so was Otumfuo’s special aide, Mawerehene, Dr Baafuor Hyeaman Brantuo.


Even though Father for all, Otumfuo was a Viking by osmosis, so we proclaimed. Our diplomatic move was indeed meant to enhance the aura and dignity of Mensah Sarbah Hall,  plus this other benefit we only whispered:  Our impending ceremony being a fund raising event, incidental windfalls could drop as we rubbed shoulders with the kingdom of gold.


While we were all set for the historic event came the shocking news: the Labadi stool would not tolerate the visit of Otumfuo!


An anti-climax was in the offing; the well-publicized event could be called off, and the Hall hit with the shame of setting our targets too high. But why would a visit by Otumfuo to an autonomous university or any part of Ghana be considered a breach?  Did the King of Asante need a visa to visit Accra? While the answers were not clear, we sent a delegation to the Labadi chief and elders; strategically among our envoys was Professor Irene Odotei herself from Labadi. The Labadi palace was crowded that day, peering eyes flaming with rage.




The query posed was simple: why had Otumfuo Osei Tutu been invited for a role that the Chief of Labadi could play? Our delegation exchanged curious glances; but the bouquet of answers we rattled was unacceptable: ‘Otumfuo is our Chief patron…the Chief of Labadi has also been invited…the hall has hosted other chiefs in the past, etc. Those ‘booklong’ responses were not enough to cool tempers. We returned to Legon frustrated but did not surrender.


Days of negotiation continued between Legon authorities and Labadi youth and elders. Quietly behind the scenes were moves by former Regional Minister for Ashanti, Hon Kojo Yankah. 


Then came a major initiative by ‘King Solomon,’ who sent a special emissary to whisper in the ears of Labadi chief, ‘my own brother’ in the words of Otumfuo. Grounds started softening, only for tensions to rise from further agitation by the Labadi youths.


The sod-cutting event eventually came on, but under a thick cloud of tension and tight national security, with angry Labadi youths lurking at the margins and reporting proceedings by phone. I was the master of ceremonies that day prancing back and forth, and narrating the Asante history of conquest which had given way to a war against illiteracy! Otumfuo had taken Legon by storm that day, with a huge retinue of chiefs and elders coming down from Kumasi. The University of Ghana had somehow survived the fury of Labadi, leaving only a residue of suspense




If Otumfuo Osei Tutu paid a successful courtesy call on Ga Mantse last Saturday, it can be said that we have come a long way as a Republic.


The King of Asante after all needs no entry visa for a formal visit to Accra.


Legon still remembers.

"Freemasonry and religion: Dispelling the myths, distilling the truth","Worshipful Festival MasterRight Worshipful District Grand MasterBrethren of the Honourable Fraternity of FreemasonsDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,


My father, Francis Lodowic Bartels, whom we honour and celebrate today at this Festival, was a Freemason of Grand Rank as so eloquently reflected in the oration. My husband, James Emmanuel Kwegyir Aggrey-Orleans, was a Freemason of Grand Rank. My uncle, James Villiers Legge Phillips, was the District Grand Master. My only brother, Francis Lodowic Bartels Jnr., was a Freemason. All of them now belong to the Grand Lodge above.


To continue the family tradition, my son, Bertrand-Leslie Aggrey-Orleans, a barrister, is a Freemason.


Perhaps my “Masonic” lineage, so to speak, is what persuaded and encouraged the Lodges to take the tremendous risk of asking me to give the Festival lecture on the fascinating but vexed subject of “Freemasonry and Religion: Dispelling the Myths, Distilling the Truth”. I am deeply honoured and humbled by your gracious invitation. I trust that your confidence, which far exceeds my own, will be justified.  It is, indeed, a privilege for me.


In the introduction of his masterly publication “The History of Freemasonry”, Albert Mackey, a 19th-century American physician and author, himself a Freemason, quotes De Witt Clinton as follows:




“Of all the institutions which have been established to improve the condition of mankind, Freemasonry stands pre-eminent in usefulness as it is in age ….. “ The quotation goes on to explore the possible origins of the Craft.


Yet, Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, of all the institutions which aim at bettering the human condition, few are as misunderstood, maligned or even vilified as Freemasonry, surrounded as it is by myths and legends.


My own childhood recollection and “experience”, one might say, regarding Freemasonry was the eternal recitation of the ritual by my father in preparation for a Masonic meeting. The little books written in red and black were mysterious to a little girl. We understood as children that those books were sacred, not to be touched.  If we as much as set eyes on the writing we would go blind. These books were hedged and hallowed by secrecy.


And then there was Fio who brought the summons. A very dark-skinned middle-aged man, Fio was always traditionally clad in black. His appearance, to us, not only symbolized mystery but also served to emphasise the secrecy surrounding the Fraternity of which he was a proud and faithful servant.




Fio would stand at the bottom of the staircase until one of us plucked the courage to receive, almost snatch, the communication from his hand for Father.


These were my very first recollections regarding Freemasonry. Looking back, the recitation of the ritual served the additional purpose of exercising father’s mental faculties. Father was lucid until the end, putting the finishing touches to his manuscript. And Fio certainly deserved the utmost consideration.


But Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, my appreciation of Freemasonry has come a long way since.  And so has the appreciation of others.


A very senior public official in the security architecture of the country during the period of military rule is reputed to have indicated that had he known what Freemasonry was, a fraternity grounded in brotherly love, relief and truth, he would have joined the Craft. This was during the period when the then-District Grand Master, Right Worshipful Bro. J.V.L. Phillips, was doing his utmost to prevent the seizure of the Meeting Halls.  And I believe he largely succeeded.




Yet, the myths remain. To dispel the myths and distil the truth regarding Freemasonry, we might pose a few simple questions from the point of view of the layman about the Institution of Freemasonry and how it relates to religion and religious practices:



What is Freemasonry?  Is it a Religion or just a secret society?


What is Religion?


Who and what are Freemasons?


How does the Institution portray itself to the general public?


What is the public perception of Freemasons?


Why are religious bodies so adversely critical of Freemasonry?


Is there any semblance of occult practices in the rituals of Freemasons?


Do Freemasons have their own Bible and a Heaven reserved for them?


What are the Myths and the Truths?


Is the Institution doing enough to protect and defend itself against negative perceptions and mounting virulent attacks?



What is Freemasonry?


Freemasonry as an Institution is a world-wide establishment with a presence throughout the globe.  It has a very long history. It has its origins in the guilds of stonemasons and architects who built cathedrals and castles in medieval Europe.


The Institution itself defines Freemasonry as “A peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols”.




Morality connotes the principles of good behaviour and discipline and the maintenance of ethical standards and values across all spheres of life.  Little wonder then that one of the objectives of Freemasonry is to “make good men better”. However, one may wonder what is so peculiar about that system of morality as propagated by the Institution.  Possibly, it being veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols provides the answer.  The allegorical nature suggests that teachings of moral principles are done in the form of storytelling and the enactment of plays to underline clearly those desirable values that constitute the tenets of Freemasonry.  Furthermore, the use of symbols such as Masonic working tools and others for purposes of illustration falls within the scope of standards of teaching and learning using visual aids.


Freemasonry, we learn, is an Order founded on the principles of “Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth”.  Brotherly Love, it would appear, follows the same Christian virtues of love for one another, whilst Relief is about the precepts of mutual assistance, charity and giving to the less endowed and the deprived in society.  Truth, however, may be the contentious subject, that being one of the bases of religious disagreements as the perception of truth may very well vary, and indeed, often does, from institution to institution.


The attention of the newly initiated Mason is drawn to the Sacred Writings relating to the religious faith of the Initiate, and he is charged to consider those “as the unerring standard of truth and justice …” Based on his religious convictions, interactions with colleagues of other faiths could become an issue in the matter of what constitutes truth, thus undermining the maintenance of harmony. Of course, every religious body believes itself to be the true path to this and the life hereafter. This explains why the Order forbids discussions on issues of Religion and Politics in its assemblies.


Is Freemasonry a Religion?




The Institution contends that it is not a religion though its members are supposed to believe in a Supreme Being - God - in a generic sense.


On the website of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), the Home of Freemasonry, it is clearly stated: “We are a unique members’ organisation that has thrived for over 300 years. Having no political or religious affiliations, we comprise members of all ages, races, religions, cultures and backgrounds”; and, the statement continues, “one of the oldest secular, social and charitable organisations in the world”.


In a recent response (December 2023) to the Catholic Church’s reaffirmation of its ban on Roman Catholics becoming Freemasons, the United Grand Lodge of England reiterated its stance on Freemasonry and Religion as approved in the Grand Lodge’s statement of September 1992 and published in the news media.  Part of that statement reads: “It cannot be too strongly asserted that Masonry is neither a religion nor a substitute for religion.  Masonry seeks to inculcate in its members a standard of conduct and behaviour, which it believes to be acceptable to all creeds, but studiously refrains from intervening in the field of dogma or theology.  Masonry, therefore, is not a competitor with religion, though in the sphere of human conduct, it may be hoped that its teaching will be complementary to that of religion”.


As so concisely expressed to the outside world, Freemasonry is not a religion nor is it the antithesis of religion.  But somehow, some ceremonies within its Lodges tend to reflect religious practice in a way which is probably peculiar to the Order, such as the singing of well-known Christian hymns, even if they are sometimes substituted by Masonic lyrics, the saying of prayers led by Chaplains and the presence of an ‘Altar’ on which is displayed a ‘Holy Bible’.  Furthermore, there are constant references to the Supreme Being (God) in various forms - The Great Architect of the Universe, The Grand Geometrician of the Universe, The Great Overseer of the Universe, The Supreme Commander of the Universe, The Most High, etc.  All this is in the public domain.  Most often, however, such information is misinterpreted by the non-Freemason.




Be that as it may, I believe that singing hymns and saying prayers alone coupled with the invocation of the various names of God during meetings, do not necessarily render an organisation a religion or a religious body.  Furthermore, in assuming obligations, the new Mason is assured that whatever vows he may enter into, would not in any way impede or meddle with his civil, moral or religious duties - a further declaration reflecting the secular nature of Freemasonry, an institution free of religious or political imposition.


The question of whether it is a secret society is always debunked with the straightforward answer - no. It is not a secret society, but rather a society with secrets, like other societies and institutions.


What is Religion?


Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, the raft of definitions from the Concise Oxford Dictionary to the Catholic Encyclopaedia and by Islamic scholars and philosophers have a common theme of faith in, and worship of, a Supreme Being on whom man is dependent and of whose powerful help he feels the need.  All of them connote spirituality and morality which are believed to be essential for human development.




Might it be that the critics of Freemasonry, observing the activities of the Institution and taking into account the various definitions of religion would conclude that Freemasonry, indeed, is a religion? Furthermore, given the spiritual beliefs and practices of our societies, could there be a fear of Freemasonry as a powerful global body capable of competing with religion and leading the ‘faithful’ astray?


Who and What are Freemasons?


In any case who and what are Freemasons?  Freemasons are a group of men who have come together, having joined the Order in accordance with given qualifications as specified by the administrative body, in this case, the UGLE.  The Freemason must be over eighteen (18) years of age, believe in a Supreme Being, be of sound mind and judgement, just, upright and with strict morals.  He must be ready to accept and be guided by the fundamental principles which constitute the character of the Institution - Integrity, Friendship, Respect and Service.  He must dutifully commit himself to following them.  The belief in a Supreme Being is rooted in the fact that the background of Freemasons cuts across several religions - Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, the Baha’i faith etc.  In addition, Freemasons can boast of membership which embraces eminent personalities such as Kings, Presidents, Judges, Ministers of State, Diplomats, and indeed, notable experts and personalities from every profession.


One of the distinguishing characteristics of Freemasons is the ability to live and work together in harmony and concord, pleasing each other, being happy and communicating happiness irrespective of religious differences, political persuasion, social status or financial standing.


Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, if ever there were any star attractions to wanting to be a Freemason, I believe that they would centre on the joy of being together with friends of different backgrounds in pursuit of common objectives. That brings to mind how non-Masons become Freemasons and whether they are able, having gained admission, to develop themselves sufficiently to represent the ideals of Freemasonry. I must mention this because I strongly believe that many persons may not necessarily know much about the Order before declaring their intention or accepting to join.  Some may, therefore, enter the Order with their own skewed perceptions regarding particular benefits, with a pre-determined agenda in mind only to be disappointed and end up not portraying the better person the Institution seeks to make of them.


How does the Institution Portray Itself to the General Public?


It would appear that the Order basically presents itself to the public as a fraternal (men-only) benevolent society through its focus on charity work.  When the Order is often featured in the media, it is about donations to the needy or making available resources that might be useful to selected communities. Indeed, the headquarters of Freemasonry (UGLE) is advertised as “one of the oldest and most charitable organisations in the world”.


So elaborate are the programmes on charity presentations that the Masonic Charitable Foundation (MCF), funded by Freemasons, puts out for public consumption information on its activities which embrace a range of grants for charitable projects.  At the local level, we are all witnesses to the various donations extended to schools, hospitals and communities by the District Grand Lodge of Ghana (English Constitution) over the years, the most recent being support during the Covid-19 period, the Akosombo Dam spillage disaster and, today, the presentation of a Borehole Water Supply System for the AME Zion Cluster of Schools in Cape Coast.


In contrast, very little or nothing is said publicly about what actually happens during meetings or ceremonies behind closed doors in what used to be called ‘Temples’, but are now re-designated as ‘Halls’, possibly because of the backlash regarding the public perception of Freemasonry as a religion.  To that extent it might be said that the self-imposed secrecy which surrounds the meetings and ceremonies is what leads to the wild speculation by the public which endeavours to fill the vacuum in information. Hence, the so-called ‘secrets’ of Freemasons.


What is the Public Perception of Freemasons?


Somehow, to the general populace who are not Masons, particularly in our part of the world, the mention of the word ‘Freemason’ evokes some kind of awe akin to mysterious, mystical or occult practices. One only needs to browse through social media to be inundated with videos, films, adverts and spurious claims regarding the ‘powers’ of Freemasons, a tool, which fraudsters employ for their own deceitful purposes.


Some, however, view Freemasons with a deep sense of reverence, seeing them impeccably dressed in their black suits, driving beautiful cars, wining and dining at exquisite locations.  Even for this category of ‘observers’, there is a belief that there must be something in Freemasonry, which, should one be lucky enough to become a member, opens the door to wealth and success.


Generally, there is a lot of negativity in public thinking about the activities of Freemasons in Ghana, to the extent that many religious bodies do not relent in their criticism of the nature and character of the Fraternity.  The main bone of contention is whether Freemasons believed to be a cult, are not hiding behind the notion of a benevolent society such as the Rotary or the Lions Clubs (whose activities are openly known) to promote their ‘secret’ brand of religion.


Why are Religious Bodies so adversely critical of Freemasons?


Ghana abounds in religious bodies which serve a population composed approximately of 71% Christians, 20% Muslims and others (Government Census 2021). The principal Christian churches are the Roman Catholic, the Methodist, the Anglican and the Presbyterian Churches as well as the Church of Pentecost.


In addition, there are, a plethora of charismatic, spiritual and other religious groups littered across the country, all of which draw on the faith of their followers and do impact their level of perception of some institutions and people such as the Freemasons.  Their main attack is that Freemasonry is occult and satanic, but have no proof to support that contention, except to refer to special rings, handshakes, regalia and the secrecy shrouding their meetings which are always held behind closed doors.


Of the principal religious denominations, the Anglican Church is the most accommodating of the tenets of Freemasonry. The Church is supportive of the Institution and some of its Reverend Ministers are active members of the Fraternity.


The biggest religious body and severest critic of Freemasonry is the Roman Catholic Church.  It has opposed Masonic Lodges since 1717 and has had no fewer than eleven Popes condemning it over the years. The Church debunks the idea of Freemasonry being a benevolent and charitable organisation, especially when comparing the Fraternity with the Rotary and Lions Clubs or with the Catholic groups - the Knights of Marshall and the Knights of St. John International.


Among the many reasons adduced against Freemasonry is that the Order uses the Bible placed on an altar, quotes passages from the New Testament for its ceremonies, and yet omits the word “Christ” from the texts. Furthermore, and I quote “Freemasonry’s degrees did away with Christian prayer and any references to Catholicism. A Mason was now required to believe only in the deistic “Great (or Grand) Architect of the Universe) and an afterlife”.


The Church reiterates its position that Freemasonry is a religion in its own right and category with doctrines which are not compatible with Christian beliefs.  It maintains its landmark declaration of 1983 which states: “Therefore, the Church’s judgement in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged, since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden.  The faithful who enrol in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion”.


Indeed, the Roman Catholic Church considers that Catholics who are Freemasons stand the risk of excommunication if they do not cease being members of the Fraternity. The following is part of introductory comments to an Article in the New Catholic Encyclopaedia which further emphasises the Church’s anti-Masonic viewpoint. “Freemasonry is a politically powerful financial organisation operating under the guise of an all-encompassing religion generally open, at least at some levels, to everyone but atheists.  Their goal is the domination of the world from a deistic perspective (‘deism’- a movement or system of thought advocating natural religion, emphasizing morality, and in the 18th century, denying the interference of the Creator with the laws of the Universe)”.


Albert Mackey is often quoted by the Roman Catholic Church in articles to support the Church’s standpoint on Freemasonry as a religion. One such extract reads: “Although Freemasonry is not a dogmatic theology and is tolerant in the admission of men of every religious faith, it would be wrong to suppose that it is without a creed.  On the contrary, it has a creed, the assent to which it rigidly enforces… This creed consists of two articles. First, a belief in God, the Creator of all things…and secondly, a belief in the eternal life, to which this present life is but a preparatory and probationary state”.


Allegations are further made about Freemasonry seeing itself not only as a religion, but as a universal religion, while considering Christianity as simply one of the many sects.


Another prominent Mason, also a 19th century American author and writer on Freemasonry, is often quoted by the Church to make its point.  Albert Pike describes Freemasonry as follows: “It is the universal, eternal, immutable religion, such as God planted it in the heart of universal humanity…  Masonry propagates no creed except its own most simple and sublime one; that universal religion, taught by Nature and Reason”.  Pike further states: “Since Masonry embraces the religions of the world, it cannot require belief in Jehovah for this would exclude most of the world.  In order to accept Masons who believe in pagans, they require belief in ""a God"" or ""a Supreme Being”.


These are but a few of the thoughts that infuriate the Roman Catholic Church and cause it to distance itself from, and condemn, Freemasonry.


On the other hand, the Methodist Church (UK) in 1985 issued guidance to the Methodist faithful, advising those who wanted to remain Freemasons to declare their membership “in order to remove suspicion and mistrust”.  Furthermore, directives were given denying Freemasons the use of Methodist premises for any Masonic-related meetings, services or any other purposes.


Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, it would be recalled that in December 1999, six Freemasons of the Royal Arch Chapter of Ghana (Irish Constitution) filed a writ at an Accra High Court against the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, seeking to compel the Church to withdraw from circulation a report concerning the Lodge.  It was about a decision by the Church to ban paid agents and elders as well as all members of the Church from being members of Lodges and other secret societies and that those who were already members would have to consider withdrawing their membership from those societies.  Of course, the Freemasons won the day, in terms of the High Court ruling in their favour, thereby virtually endorsing one vital affirmation in their pleadings, that “Lodges are Friendly and not Religious Societies, and that they have neither dogma nor theology and do not preach salvation”.  An appeal to a higher court by the Presbyterian Church against the High Court’s decision fell flat.


Against this background, it would appear that the big orthodox Christian Churches (except the Anglican Church) are embarked on a crusade against one big organisation that styles itself a benevolent society rather than a religion.  Following the trail are the smaller churches, all pointing accusing fingers at Freemasons’ Lodges for non-Christian satanic rituals.


What remains to be seen is how Freemasons would come out clearly and unambiguously to defend themselves against these accusations and prove all accusers wrong. Or are the obligations and the oath of secrecy taken by Freemasons a stumbling block?


Is There any Semblance of Occultism in the Rituals of Freemasonry?


Well, this question is best left to the Freemasons themselves to answer; but from my association and interactions with them and the literature I have read, I would say that there are rituals, but they are not occult.


But what is a ‘ritual’? Does the word ‘ritual’ refer to blood sacrifices or demonic practices?  Absolutely not! There are a lot of misconceptions regarding the word ‘ritual’.  Freemasons talk about rituals in their ceremonies to describe the format and process through which they go as stipulated in that little book titled ‘Emulation Ritual’.  This accords with the definition of the word ‘ritual’ by the Concise Oxford Dictionary as “a series of actions habitually and invariably followed by someone”. But the other definition of ‘ritual’ by the same Dictionary as “a religious or solemn ceremony involving a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order” is most probably the source of the misconceptions, confusion and mistrust which characterise the public perception.


Worshipful Festival Master, Ladies and Gentlemen, as earlier stated, the peculiar system of morality of Freemasons is veiled in allegory, a kind of play-acting to bring out the deeper meaning of whatever teaching is being expounded. The solemn ceremonies so well set up and performed across the various Orders in Freemasonry, the way I understand them, constitute the ‘ritual’ contained in those little books.


What about ‘occult’?  Again, the word occult refers to “mystical, supernatural or magical powers or phenomena”. Do Freemasons actually engage in occultism? Absolutely not, to the best of my knowledge and based on the meaning of occultism.


Nothing, however, prevents members of the Fraternity who are generally persons of substance in their fields of endeavour and deep thinkers from enhancing their knowledge in their individual capacity through the study of esoteric philosophical teaching, all in the pursuit of self-improvement. I would certainly not find that strange. Indeed, I would welcome that. Remember, one of the ideals of Freemasonry is to make good men better; and this should have nothing and has nothing to do with magical powers. It has to do with human development, in this case, the intellect.


Do Freemasons Have Their Own Bible and a Heaven Reserved for Them?


The Holy Book of sacred writings, called the Bible, we are all aware, has many versions - King James Version, New International Version (NIV), Catholic Pastoral Edition (of Community Christian Bible), Revised English Bible, etc.  However, the Books and related texts contained in these scriptures are about the same subject. The differences lie in the language and presentation because of the chain of translations over the years.


Within this context we might ask whether there is a Masonic Bible?  If there is, how different is it from the several other versions of the Holy Book?  Freemasons refer to the Sacred Writings for Christians as the Bible.  The Sacred Writings of members of other religious faiths together with the Sacred Writings for Christians (The Bible) collectively constitute the Volume of the Sacred Law (VSL).  The Christian VSL has the Old and New Testaments, containing the Books as available in the several versions listed.  What may differ from the VSL is the cover design, often bearing the Masonic symbols of the Square and Compasses, as well as the inner foreword and introductory write-ups about the Institution. Therefore, there is no special Bible appertaining to Masonic beliefs or religion that are spectacularly different from other Bibles available on the shelves.


If there are no special or peculiar Masonic Sacred Writings, might there be a Heaven reserved for Freemasons?  This, it would appear, is part of the misconception about Freemasonry as a religion, borne out of the peculiar names it adopts for various concepts in its practices. In Masonic terms, much to the chagrin of opponents, Heaven is referred to as the Grand Lodge Above.  What this implies is that either there is a separate Heaven for Masons where they go when they pass away from their earthly life, or that there is a place (a Lodge) reserved for them in the same Heaven referred to by Christians and other faiths.  Certainly, this constitutes one of the attacks on Freemasons, viewed against their claims of not being a religion.


The Myths and the Truths


Within our own localities, one of the myths that is easily debunked as ‘banalities and fairytale fantasies’ is occultism in Freemasonry, which is depicted as blood sacrifices, waking up the dead, conjuring up spirits for easy access to wealth etc. The accusation of religious mysticism with particular reference to devil worship and satanic practices is simply not true. It is a configuration borne out of ignorance. Freemasonry is not a secret occult group that holds answers to everything through supernatural powers. It is the pursuit of the improvement and enhancement of the moral fiber of a person through a system of values and a code of conduct based on the three great principles of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.


And how about the rather scary oaths and obligations with chilling penalties for the Freemason who divulges any Masonic secret or decides to leave the Order?  Once again, the truth is that these references are allegorical and not meant to be carried out as physical punishment. There is no physical punishment in Freemasonry. A Mason can resign from Freemasonry with or without a reason and nothing evil would befall him.


I have already mentioned the so-called Masonic Bible which is supposed to bear messages skewed towards Masonic beliefs.  It is clear that aside the ‘nomenclature’, the Bible used by Masons, in context, is no different from the several other versions of the Sacred Book used by religious organisations throughout the world.  The same holds true for the Muslims’ Holy Quran or the Hindu Vedas, etc., They all fall under the title, ‘Volume of the Sacred Law’.


Similarly, every religious faithful aspires to join his Maker in Heaven after this earthly life. Masons, in their various religious beliefs, also crave to do the same, but only refer to Heaven in Masonic terms as the Grand Lodge Above.


The truth of the matter is that Freemasonry does not force any religious belief on anybody. On the contrary, it encourages its members to follow their religious paths and never fail to acknowledge and perform the duties they owe to God, “with that awe and reverence which are due from the creature to his Creator”.


Freemasonry is, in truth, a fraternal and benevolent society in every respect, evidenced by the many charities it carries out so frequently around the globe.  Additionally, Freemasonry provides the platform and opportunity for people from all professions and all walks of life to meet as brothers, socialise and network, without recourse to any religious creed, political persuasion or acts of mysticism.


And how about the secret and special handshakes?  Yes, there are but these date back to the era of stonemasons who had to prove their worth as qualified builders from one level to the next. Free and Accepted Speculative Masons have adopted this practice by way of passwords leading from one degree in their ceremonies to the other; but there is nothing mysterious about them.


Another point to note is that there is a diversity of organisations classified as secret societies whose outlook resembles that of Freemasons, especially through their attire.  They are not Freemasons, but are erroneously considered as such by the public, especially when they carry out certain rituals during burials and funerals, which appear religious in scope.  Freemasons are not to be mistaken for them.


Way Forward


After the narrative of my presentation, it is time to ask whether the Order is doing enough to dispel all these negative allegations and perceptions about its perceived religious character as presumably handed down to its members. Is there a more ‘aggressive’ but diplomatic way of defending Freemasonry with concrete proof and references that would persuade the public of the true and positive nature of Freemasonry?  It would appear that the current approach of press releases in reaction to allegations is not adequate.  It is reactive and not proactive.


On the local front, is it possible that beyond the statements made during charity donations, for example, concerted efforts could be made, collectively and individually, to penetrate communities for interactions purposely to dispel the several negative misconceptions and inaccuracies about the Order?  If so, how can it be done?


And those secrets? Can there be any modifications? Of course, as a kind of discipline even among themselves, Freemasons are not entitled or expected to know what happens at the next degree which they are yet to attain.  A more open-door policy might curb the rumours of witchcraft and sorcery. But how do you do this, bearing in mind that the capacity to keep a secret is a requirement in many professions including diplomatic service. Non-disclosure agreements are a regular feature of the business world No one seems to be troubled by them.


On a lighter note, I am sure that you have heard that even though the Institution occasionally organises open days with press and cameramen to view their meeting places, hitherto known as Temples, the real secretive items, they claim, are removed and hidden. All that is shown to the public by the cameras are empty chairs and tables.


Worshipful Festival Master, Right Worshipful District Grand Master, Members of the Honourable Fraternity of Freemasons, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, my presentation reflects my perception of Freemasonry garnered through years of close association with outstanding Freemasons. But it would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the invaluable and indispensable support which I have received from very senior Masonic friends in crafting my presentation.  I am most grateful to them. If there are any flaws, I take full responsibility for them and I ask you in the spirit of brotherly love to forgive me. Right Worshipful Brother Isaac Owulaku Hood, District Grand Master, I thank you and all the brethren for the honour done by my father today, and thank you all for your gracious attention.

Reality zone with Vicky Wireko: Camphor exposure is toxic according to recent alert,"Camphor, popularly known and patronised in some homes is said to be closely related to what is known in some other places as mothballs. 


Despite its wide domestic use and exposure, however, the worrying alert coming through is that camphor has as its active ingredient, a dangerous chemical also known as naphthalene.


The bad news is that naphthalene is said to be toxic to humans. It is carcinogenic and active exposure to the chemical can cause the most dreaded disease, cancer. That is a scary alert knowing the decades of exposure one has had with this once-upon-a-time household “wonder”.   


Some of us have grown up with camphor in almost every part of the home.  Its overuse sees the product in the bathroom and toilets as a form of deodoriser to eliminate unpleasant odours. One sees them used even in some public toilets and urinals.


They come in various shapes, sizes and attractive colours of late. On top of its use in the bathroom and toilets, it has also been used in cupboards, wardrobes and sometimes in certain corners of the home to keep unwanted creatures such as ants and cockroaches away. They are even left in the open, in gutters or thrown down the drain to eliminate creatures such as rats and lizards.




This product is now coming up strongly as a “stay-away from”, having been banned in some countries in the West allegedly due to its toxicity to humans, especially children, and for its carcinogenic properties.  Because it contains naphthalene, it is also said to be highly inflammable.


Education


In our country, though some individuals may have had prior knowledge of the toxicity of camphor and may have stayed away from its use knowing the consequences of its continued use, some of us are hearing about the escalated dangers for the first time.  Thankfully, with the notion that knowledge is power, one is convinced that education on the product would go far with the recent alert in social media. 


The social media postings which also had translations in the Twi language sounding the alert regarding the deadliness of excessive exposure were timely. Though coming a bit late in the day when other countries have already banned its use, the education one gets through the postings is empowering and well-received. It is better late than never, especially when it raises critical health implications. 




As one waits for the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) to formally speak on the issue, we have all been forewarned.  The information out there and the warnings shared should be enough caution for one to begin to stay away from camphor use.


Environmental pollution


What perhaps is alarming to note from some related research available is that the public can be exposed to naphthalene primarily through environmental pollution including airborne emissions from industrial sources, open burning, traffic exhaust fumes, especially from old vehicles and shockingly from cigarette smoking.


Even before one got to hear about naphthalene, one knew some of these anti-social practices like open burning and exhaust fumes have been topics of wide media discussions in the past and hopefully under surveillance by the authorities concerned.




However, it is a regrettable observation that as a society, we seem to have taken some of the bylaws regulating those ill practices lightly mainly because there are no strict enforcements.  For example, in the Agbogbloshie enclave, it is an open secret that discarded computers, mobile phones and other electrical products and parts are openly burned, poisoning the environment. 


The fact that the practice continues shows how much our law enforcers have spurned the effects that open burning continues to have on the inhabitants and those who patronise the area.


The same goes for those who drive vehicles with glaring emissions. Or is it not something the Driver and Vehicle License Authority (DVLA) tests or looks out for? Otherwise, one wonders sometimes how those vehicles qualify for roadworthiness given their harmful air pollution. 


With police officers visibly on our roads these days, we should begin to see an end to this sort of environmental pollution in our society since they all add up as dangers to one’s health. 




If our regulators should come out to formally ban the use of camphor for health reasons, one only hopes drastic actions would be taken to rid the shelves and punish anyone who sneaks them in.


The seriousness of the health effects of camphor should be trumpeted high for the sake of preserving health.  To be forewarned is forearmed.

Barima Nsu: The harmful notion that men must not cry,"The idea that men must not cry, often summarized in the phrase ""Barima Nsu,"" is a deeply ingrained social expectation that prevents men from expressing their emotions openly. 


The origin of this belief is unclear, but its impact is significant, leading to the stigmatization of men who show vulnerability.


In many cultures, including mine, a man who cries or shows any form of emotion is often deemed socially unfit and labeled a weakling. Whether facing a job loss, heartbreak, or the overwhelming challenges of life, men are expected to bottle up their feelings. This societal pressure demands that men must not show any signs of weakness, pushing them to suppress their emotions.


When I lost my dearest uncle a few years ago and expressed my grief through tears, many people questioned why I was crying. Similarly, when my cousin Benny passed away, I had to hide my mourning from friends to avoid being judged. This was epitomized by the case of a student at KNUST who was mocked and called a sissy for mourning his girlfriend's death. His friends recorded him crying and shared the video on social media, where many netizens joined in the mockery. The prevailing sentiment was that a man should not cry, especially over a relationship.


A friend once called me petty for reacting emotionally to things people, especially women, did to me. According to him, a man should not show any emotions. In our conversation, I asked him why many men die prematurely, and he had no answer. I explained that many men die because they bottle up their emotions due to the stigma associated with expressing them. Men often remain silent rather than ask for help, contributing to the high rates of mental health issues and premature death among men.




June has been declared Men's Mental Health Awareness Month, highlighting the importance of mental health and reminding us that seeking help is not a sign of weakness. Mental health disorders are a global concern, affecting around 970 million people in 2019, with anxiety and depression being the most common. These conditions are a leading cause of disability and are strongly linked to premature death due to the increased risk of suicide and other health issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that people with severe mental health conditions tend to die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. Mental health conditions account for over 800,000 deaths per year through suicide alone.


In Africa, mental health issues are compounded by limited access to care, stigma, and inadequate funding. The region faces a significant treatment gap, with many people not receiving the necessary care. The lack of mental health resources exacerbates the burden, leading to high rates of untreated mental health conditions and associated mortality. The situation is critical, with suicide rates and other mental health-related deaths remaining high.


Ghana, like many other African countries, struggles with mental health issues due to inadequate mental health infrastructure and societal stigma. According to WHO data, the suicide rate in Ghana is about 5.4 per 100,000 people. Mental health services in Ghana are scarce, and there is a significant treatment gap, with many individuals not receiving the care they need. Efforts are being made to improve mental health services, but challenges remain in addressing the full scope of the problem.


Given these staggering figures, it is time to rethink harmful narratives like ""Barima Nsu."" Crying or expressing emotions does not make a man any less of a man. Manhood is not tied to whether one cries or asks for help when needed. 




Speaking up when mistreated or crying in response to life's challenges proves that you are human. If robots can respond to commands, how much more should a human being be allowed to respond to emotions? When life overwhelms you and crying brings relief, do not hold back. Crying does not make you weak—it makes you human.

Bridging digital divide  resilience of satellite TV in the age of digital media,"In recent years, the proliferation of digital media platforms has been inseparably linked to the work of telecommunications to drive smartphone penetration, data, and internet services. This evolution has significantly impacted media consumption and television viewing, especially on emerging digital platforms.


Despite the gradual erosion of satellite TV broadcasting’s dominance due to shifting consumer behavior and channels adapting to these changes, a substantial gap remains in areas where access to smartphones and data services is limited by affordability or availability. Consequently, satellite TV continues to hold a significant market share.


The role of telcos in digital media consumption


Telcos have been pivotal in accelerating the adoption of smartphones and enhancing internet accessibility. By investing heavily in infrastructure, they have enabled a broader population to access digital media platforms. This has transformed how people consume content, shifting preferences towards on-demand streaming services and digital TV. However, this digital revolution has predominantly benefited urban and semi-urban areas with access to more developed infrastructure.


Bridging the digital divide




The launch of Multi TV 15 years ago exemplifies a strategic initiative to bridge the digital divide in television access. A collaboration between SES, KNET, and Multimedia Group, Multi TV was designed to democratize TV viewing, and currently provides over 5 million homes with access to television. This partnership capitalized on satellite technology to reach areas where cable and internet services were either unaffordable or unavailable, ensuring that a significant portion of the population could enjoy TV content.


At its inception, the world was transitioning from standard definition (SD) to the early stages of high definition (HD) broadcasting. Multi TV’s introduction came at a critical juncture, offering an accessible solution to many who otherwise would have remained disconnected from modern broadcasting trends.


The HD+ revolution


In 2020, SES advanced further with the launch of HD+ on the MultiTV Platform, providing a superior viewing experience with 5X clearer pictures, Local Channel Numbering (LCN), Personal Video Recorder (PVR) capabilities, and an Electronic Program Guide (EPG). This upgrade allowed everyday Ghanaian homes to catch up with global standards in television quality, significantly enhancing their viewing experience.




The transition to HD+ was not just a technological upgrade but a commitment to improving content quality and viewer satisfaction. This move was pivotal in retaining viewers amidst growing competition from digital platforms that offered superior picture quality and user interfaces.


The shift to Free-To-Air HD channels


Recently, HD+ announced a business model shift from a subscription model to a Free-To-Air (FTA) business model, a shift with far-reaching implications for the television market in Ghana. This transition is expected to foster greater collaboration among satellite operators like SES, telcos, advertisers, and content producers. By offering HD+ as FTA, there is potential to open up the space for more innovation and expansion, addressing the market saturation in urban areas and extending quality content to underserved regions.


Collaborative synergies and market expansion




The FTA model’s success hinges on robust collaboration across the broadcasting ecosystem. Telcos can leverage their extensive networks to enhance distribution, ensuring that more households can access HD+ content. Advertisers, attracted by the expanded reach and improved content quality, are likely to increase their investment in television advertising, driving revenue growth for broadcasters.


Moreover, content producers will be incentivized to create higher quality, diverse programming, knowing they can reach a broader audience. This dynamic creates a virtuous cycle of investment and innovation, ultimately benefiting viewers with richer and more varied content.


The evolution of digital media platforms, incited by telcos’ efforts to increase smartphone and internet penetration, has reshaped the media landscape. While this trend has challenged traditional satellite TV’s dominance, initiatives like Multi TV and the HD+ transition demonstrate the enduring relevance and adaptability of satellite broadcasting.


The shift to an FTA model for HD+ is poised to drive further collaboration and innovation, expanding the TV market in Ghana and ensuring that quality television remains accessible to all. As the industry continues to evolve, these partnerships will be crucial in navigating the future of media consumption and broadcasting.

Schandorf writes: What Ghanaians missed in the toilet cleaners comment on PhDs and Dutch passports,"Today is Monday, June 10 2023; a fresh new week with a lot of prospects! However, the week gone by was particularly exciting and I'll highlight the reasons.


For starters, I discovered that one of the widely sung worship tracks in the world was actually composed by a Ghanaian! For all the years we've been singing, 'We bow down and worship Yahweh', it never occurred to me that Kofi Karikari was the talent behind it.


Frankly, that revelation was stunning and I've told God to trend my interview with him, so Kofi gets his flowers. Indeed the last time I checked, close to 80,000 people had seen it on Facebook and I hope it travels further.


Another event that made my week was the Black Stars' victory against Mali on Thursday. After a series of ugly defeats and draws, the team finally managed to put a smile on our faces, and that was another beautiful spectacle.


But none of these got my attention like the explosive comments of a certain janitor in the Netherlands! In a video that's still viral, Kofigabs, popularly known as 'Mr Happiness', argued that it's better to own a Dutch passport than to have a PhD from Ghana's premier university, Legon.




In the one-minute video which has 11,000 views on my page alone, Kofi explained that his access to a Dutch passport gives him the ease of travelling the world; a privilege a PhD holder from Ghana may not enjoy.


Needless to say, his comments have triggered a lot of debates and an avalanche of opinions! While some have applauded his views, others appear indifferent. And many more are burning with red-hot anger.


According to his critics, his comments were reckless and can only come from the lips of a 'daft envious soul' who has a deep-seated hatred for folks with doctorate degrees. Others have even questioned his sanity for 'disregarding' PhD holders in Ghana!


The point, however, is that, are the insults justified and were Kofi's comments truly misplaced? To answer this question, I'll do to Kofigabs what I do to Kevin Taylor and Twene Jonas whenever they vent. My approach to these serial critics is that I ignore the vitriol in their opinions and nine out of ten, they always make sense!




Indeed, if you also take away the seeming ridicule and 'disrespect' in Kofi's tone, you'll arrive at the inevitable conclusion that the crux or focus of his message was not about the acquisition of Legon PhDs per se. But rather a strong disquiet for the quality of life in Ghana and the prospects of the country's educational system.


Like a typical lawyer's assessment, the 'spirit' of his comments was more about Ghana's development and less about locally acquired degrees. Having said this, the question now arises; how many Ghanaians will prefer to stay, live and work in Ghana, compared to taking abode in the Netherlands and other European countries?


Like my senior colleague, Manasseh Azure, stressed in his recent piece on the matter, hundreds of Ghanaians are yearning to flee the country in search of green pastures! If you doubt this, why are the embassies filled with droves queuing for visas?


If Ghana were a land of milk of honey, or at least had droplets of the same, would the urge to leave the country be so high? Point of correction; there's milk and honey in Ghana. Except that, it's in the keep of greedy politicians and their cronies alone. That if you're not a friend of the system, you may not be happy.




Now let me use journalists to illustrate a point. Do you know that despite the high-end intellectual job of conducting interviews, filing reports, editing scripts, producing shows and hosting programmes, journalists are part of the poorly paid professionals in the country?


Indeed, the last report by the School of Communication Studies bemoaned the poor remuneration of journalists amongst other harsh factors. Reading the 101-page report from Legon is enough to discourage any fresh entrant who thinks that reading on TV or presenting on radio pays because truthfully, there’s no financial pleasure apart from the supposed popularity and 'clout'.


Yet in other jurisdictions, journalists are not paupers! They're not a bunch of fluid writers who make a living from attending press conferences and waiting to sign for 'soli' from dismissive aides of ministers.


The job pays well in other countries and I dare say if 90% of journalists in Ghana had the opportunity to travel and work in a country like Netherlands, they would all quit their newsrooms with the speed of light; starting from the author of this piece; MYSELF!




Apart from journalists, many other professionals will also jump at international openings without thinking twice! And that explains the massive brain drain we see for example in the health sector, and this is what Kofi actually meant when he said having a Dutch passport is more profitable than a Ghanaian PhD (a prestige job).


To treat his comment literally will be to miss the kernel of the issue; which is that Ghana is now a living hell and thus it's better to pitch camps in other countries than to be hopeful in a country that looks sold to some deceptive politicians who can't stop making promises.


Some of those who were angry even wished they were not in Ghana, but in a vain attempt to appear more patriotic than Kwame Nkrumah himself, they accosted the man and called him names in their sufferings.


Suffice it to say, that is not patriotism at all! Patriotism doesn't mean defending the rots in your country and being agitated because your country's identity is being shredded or ridiculed on the internet for valid reasons. That in my view, is sheer nationalistic exuberance!




If we're truly angry at all, we must channel our disgust to calling for better policy reforms that will make sanitary pads more affordable and that will redeem national service allowances from debts.


Until then, a toilet cleaner, who has a better quality of life will be justified to mock anybody who wears a suit and tie, but has to queue to buy prepaid units and who sleeps in unannounced darkness like a slave!


And so in effect, I stand with the substance of Kofi's comments and when next I pray to God, I'll add a Dutch passport to my requests. But I'll do this in a church that won't ask for a 'seed' for God to bless me.


We shall visit that matter later but for now, Kofi spoke the truth! If you doubt it, check the value of the cedi and see if you'll wave the Ghana flag high or not!




                                                                            *****

"Human-centric, hybrid AI opens up new possibilities","We are at the beginning of the most exciting, and probably one of the most historic moments in technology. The era of mobile AI is here – which for Samsung opened up with the introduction of Galaxy AI features on the Galaxy S24 series, our first AI phone.


Revolutionizing Mobile Experiences with a Hybrid AI Approach 


To bring the real-life benefits of generative AI technology to the Galaxy S24 series, we took a hybrid approach to our AI integration. AI offers so many possibilities, and we believe mobile devices are the primary access point for unlocking its potential as users around the globe continue to rely on their phones for most of their day-to-day needs.


The essential role that mobile devices play in everyday life means they are very personal items that people use during many critical and memorable moments. We understand these behaviours and believe smartphones should work harder so that users can truly make the most of important moments in a just simpler, more intuitive, and more epic way. We also recognize the importance of privacy which is why we give users full control over what they share and what they keep private.


We believe our hybrid approach is the most practical and reliable solution to meet all these needs and puts Samsung ahead of the curve. We are providing users with a balance between the instant responsiveness and extra privacy assurance of on-device AI, and the versatility of cloud-based AI through open collaborations with industry-leading partners in offering a variety of functions they need for daily life.




Expanding Possibilities with On-device AI


We made the ‘Live Translate’ feature on-device AI-based, because voice calls are the most basic feature of a smartphone, yet also an intimate and private means of communication. Samsung has committed to empowering users to communicate without language barriers, while at the same time ensuring every communication is safe and private.


To make this feature a reality, our R&D team worked day and night as part of a collaborative process that truly brought out the best in our teams. From determining the right size of AI language models to training and testing in real-life scenarios, our R&D organizations within the MX business challenged themselves and pushed beyond the limits of what we thought was possible to get this feature running entirely on-device.


Samsung’s global R&D networks around the world, which are in charge of growing the best talents and developing core technologies in each region, have also played a pivotal role. Samsung Research Centers around the globe, including Poland, China, India and Vietnam have dedicated themselves to developing and expanding the languages supported by Galaxy AI. 




Languages are very cultural, contemporary, and localized so to help people break down language barriers and communicate more naturally, the role of our local R&D offices is even more crucial in opening up new possibilities for users in more regions than ever before.


All these efforts have enabled Samsung to offer something completely new which I’m excited to share. Soon, Samsung is extending the power of Galaxy AI beyond Samsung’s own native calling app by expanding Live Translate to other third-party message apps to support voice calls. So you can stay in contact with friends or colleagues, communicating on your favourite apps in multiple languages.


And since this feature has been integrated into our on-device AI language translation model, users will be able to experience barrier-free communication without worrying about privacy issues like personal data being shared outside their phone when using Live Translate.


I expect that more and more mobile AI features will be incorporated inside mobile devices as the intelligent computing power of the latest chips – particularly NPUs – advances at a blazing fast speed, along with other technologies. This will enable more people to embrace AI and make every day more convenient while offering greater peace of mind.




Growing Galaxy AI for Tomorrow’s Needs, Today


This exciting news is all part of the extension of our commitment to Galaxy AI and entering the next phase of the mobile AI era. The introduction of Galaxy AI on the Galaxy S24 series was only the start. To deliver a completely new and unique AI experience, we will further optimize the Galaxy AI experience for the upcoming foldable devices. Our foldables are the most versatile and flexible form factor in Samsung Galaxy and when combined with Galaxy AI, these two complementary technologies will together unlock all new possibilities.


Samsung is also committed to expanding Galaxy AI experiences across the broader Galaxy ecosystem in a way that only Samsung can. As the mobile AI era moves forward at a rapid pace, Samsung is accelerating mobile AI innovations to meet the needs of not only today but tomorrow.

Prince Hamid Armah: State intervention in addressing housing deficits in Ghana: Implications for SDGs,"Housing is not just a roof over one's head; it is a cornerstone of human dignity, security, and stability. Yet, in Ghana, a severe housing deficit continues to pose significant challenges, impacting millions of lives and stifling national development. This article delves into the pressing issue of housing in Ghana, exploring the critical role of the state in mitigating this crisis. It also highlights how addressing housing challenges is integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring that no one is left behind. Through an examination of government initiatives and future directions, this piece aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state’s efforts and the broader implications for sustainable development.


The Current State of Housing in Ghana


Ghana's housing deficit stands at an alarming 1.8 million units, a figure that continues to grow with the country's rapid urbanization and population increase. The shortage has led to overcrowded living conditions, the proliferation of informal settlements, and inflated housing costs, which further marginalize low and middle-income earners. The housing crisis not only impacts individual well-being but also hinders economic growth and social stability. Addressing this deficit is crucial to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).


Housing has long been a contentious issue, with differing views on whether the state should be involved in its provision. Some argue that the state should not interfere in the housing market, while others contend that the state has a fundamental responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to decent housing. This paper supports the latter view, positing that the state indeed has a duty to provide housing for its citizens. This responsibility is underscored by the constitutional mandate and the imperative to uphold human dignity. Article 15 of the Constitution of Ghana states that ""the dignity of all persons shall be inviolable."" This principle underscores the importance of housing as a fundamental human right. Adequate housing is essential for maintaining human dignity, health, and well-being. It is within this context that the state's role becomes paramount in ensuring that this basic need is met for all citizens. Providing decent housing contributes directly to SDG 3 by improving health outcomes and promoting well-being.


Government Initiatives and Interventions




Recognizing the urgency of the housing crisis, the government of Ghana, under the leadership of His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has initiated several policies aimed at addressing housing challenges. These initiatives are designed to respond to both the demand and supply sides of affordable housing, thereby improving living conditions across the country. These efforts support SDG 11, which emphasizes the need for inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities.



National Home Ownership Fund (formerly National Housing and Mortgage Finance Initiative): The National Home Ownership Fund (NHOF)  is a strategic effort to provide affordable housing to low and middle-income earners. The initiative involves partnerships with private banks to construct affordable housing units while offering mortgage and construction financing options that make homeownership more accessible. Additionally, government also introduced the Affordable Housing Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) that have been supporting Rent-to-Own schemes as part of efforts to increase access to homeownership. These initiatives align with SDG 1 by helping to reduce poverty through increased access to affordable housing.


Affordable Housing Project: This project aims to bridge the housing gap by constructing affordable homes nationwide. By utilizing cost-effective building materials and innovative construction techniques, the project seeks to reduce costs without compromising quality, thereby making housing more accessible to a broader segment of the population. This contributes to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation.


Regulatory Framework: To ensure sustainable housing development, the Ghanaian government has implemented policies to regulate the real estate market. These include incentives for private developers of affordable housing, stricter zoning laws, and measures to prevent speculative practices that inflate prices. The regulatory framework is bolstered by the Real Estate Agency Council (REAC), which oversees real estate transactions, ensures transparency and accountability, licenses agents, and enforces standards to prevent fraud. These efforts support SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) by promoting fair and transparent practices in the housing market.


National Rent Assistance Scheme (NRAS): Launched to address the challenges faced by renters, the NRAS provides financial assistance to eligible low and middle-income households. The scheme offers support with rent advances, making it easier for individuals and families to secure housing without the burden of large upfront payments. This initiative directly addresses SDG 1 by alleviating the financial strain on low-income households.


Community Affordable Housing Initiatives by State Housing Company Limited (SHC): The SHC has undertaken several community-based affordable housing projects, such as the Asokore-Mampong Affordable Housing Project. This project focuses on constructing high-quality, affordable residential units in strategic locations, providing homes to low and middle-income earners. This supports SDG 11 by promoting sustainable urban development.


Urban Redevelopment by Tema Development Corporation (TDC): The TDC has been instrumental in Tema's Community 25 Housing Project. This initiative focuses on developing planned residential estates that include modern amenities and infrastructure, offering affordable housing solutions while ensuring proper urban planning. Similarly, the Company also embarked on several in-filling initiatives in Tema Community 3 as part of efforts to increase access to housing options while optimizing the use of prime land and infrastructure in the acquisition area. These interventions. These interventions align with SDG 11 by ensuring cities are inclusive and sustainable.



Conclusion and the BENCH 2024 Platform


The housing crisis in Ghana presents a significant challenge that requires urgent and sustained government intervention. The state has a critical role to play in ensuring that all citizens have access to decent and affordable housing, as enshrined in the constitution and international human rights frameworks. By prioritizing housing in national development agendas and implementing innovative solutions, the government can create a more equitable society where every individual has the opportunity to live in dignity and security.


Addressing the housing challenges in Ghana is not just a matter of policy but a moral imperative. The state's active involvement in the housing sector is essential to overcoming the current deficit and ensuring a brighter future for all Ghanaians. Through strategic initiatives, increased investment, and effective regulation, Ghana can move towards a reality where adequate housing is a right enjoyed by every citizen. Furthermore, achieving this goal is integral to realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring that no one is left behind in the journey towards sustainable development and human dignity.




The maiden Built Environment National Conference on Housing and Hydrology (BENCHH) offers a unique opportunity to delve deeper into these issues. This conference, set to take place on July 2-4, 2024, at the Labadi Beach Hotel, will bring together policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders to discuss and develop actionable strategies for tackling Ghana’s housing and hydrology challenges. By engaging in these discussions, we can collectively share best practices, foster collaboration and drive progress towards sustainable housing solutions that align with the SDGs, ensuring that Ghana's future generations have access to the homes they need and deserve.

Franklin Cudjoes Unfiltered Truth: My journey from friendship to critique with President Nana Addo,"Some friends in government are asking how it is ""I fell out"" with my friend, President Nana Addo, as they have noted I ""attack him a lot these days."" I will provide a brief response.


To start with, I have deep respect and admiration for President Nana Akufo-Addo for his decades-long investment in pushing the boundaries of freedom from totalitarian rule. And when he became president, he had not hidden his admiration for my person in meetings sometimes to my pleasant discomfort.


For instance, the President had some flowery compliments for yours truly on November 25, 2017, at the birthday event of one of my respected lawyer friends. “I saw Franklin Cudjoe as I was coming in. And I heard the statement, ‘Now, the most important man in Ghana.’ And I had a feeling he was going to say ‘Franklin Cudjoe.’ Only to hear that it was me that he was talking about. Because he [Franklin Cudjoe] is certainly the most important man in Ghana.”- President Akufo-Addo.


Yes, my able lieutenants, Bright Simons, Selorm Branttie, Kofi Bentil, and I were invited by Nana and his small team of advisers to discuss the feasibility of the Free SHS programme way before Nana won elections in 2016. We disagreed with the free-for-all approach, but we provided a detailed analysis projecting enrolment figures and financial outlays into 2020.


l am so disappointed and angry with him and spare no chance to criticise him for sitting aloof for his ministers and some CEOs of State Enterprises to run the economy aground, destroy our pristine rivers and forests through illegal mining, engage in crookish multi-million dollar procurement scams (SML, PDS, KelniGVG, 5G network license Frontiers Health Covid-19 [only 25% of all funds received applied directly to covid-related interventions].




A few years ago, 85 % of all procured contracts bypassed the GIFMIS system that could have tracked cooked scams, Very generous GENSER gas deal to party financiers and very, very poor decisions in the oil sector…losing Ghana almost $30bn in the Aker oil deal. Just look at what the CEO of the Trade Fair Centre has done to the centre, supposedly under superior management. These are just a few of your grave sins, my friend Nana Addo. I haven't even added the SALL debacle to the list.


Now Nana’s legacy is that he supervised the most fiscally reckless economy since independence, and leaves us with humongous debts to last a lifetime and succeeded in literally cutting us off from borrowing from the international markets. What irks me the most is his cantankerous Cathedral project with a hole waiting for God's possible fresh anointing. It will never happen before he leaves the office.


So yes, Nana Addo was my friend, and only true friends can tell each other boldly in the face the truth. Nana, your legacy is ruined.


We can be friends again when l read your memoire apologising for taking us on a bumpy ride to your hell's kitchen.




Now Bawumia is struggling to dance around the economy, the adulterated fuel responsible for the jerky movement of the vehicle you drove, and he is hoping to take over the reins of the damaged vehicle he lavishly praised as the safest ever since Henry Ford's God be with him.


Share this widely for those small boys and girls in the NPP who think they know us well.

Nii Okantah Ankrah: Anybody but the NPP or NDC... So Who?,"Since the inception of the 4th Republic and the return to democratic rule in Ghana, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) have alternated in power. 


This began with Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings, who many thought would refuse to cede power after enjoying two decades of both military and democratic rule. However, to the admiration of all, he peacefully handed over power to J.A. Kufuor in 2000.


The NPP’s new administration was initially welcomed with enthusiasm, but after eight years, Ghanaians opted to bring back the NDC in what is locally referred to as ""sankofa"" (going back to fetch). The 2008 election was particularly intense, requiring a runoff that ultimately hinged on the results from the town of Tain in the Brong Ahafo region. The NDC emerged victorious, bringing the late J.E.A. Mills, fondly called Asomdwehene (King of Peace), to power.


In 2012, Ghana faced an unprecedented event when President Mills passed away in office. His vice president, John Mahama, assumed the presidency as mandated by the constitution. Mahama's subsequent election victory was contested in the Supreme Court, marking another first in Ghana's democratic journey. However, his tenure ended when Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the NPP won the 2016 election, after several attempts to secure the presidency. Initially seen as a potential game-changer, Akufo-Addo’s government is now facing criticism from those who once hailed him as a savior.


This brings us to the current conversation about a third force in Ghanaian politics. Despite the presence of many political parties, the NPP and NDC dominate the landscape. Recently, discussions have intensified about breaking this duopoly, with dissatisfaction growing towards both parties.




Several potential candidates have emerged as alternatives. Akua Donkor, whose political stance often seems to shift, and Osofo Kyiri Abosom of the Ghana Union Movement (GUM), are among those considered. Another figure is Nana Kwame Bediako, popularly known as Cheddar, who has generated significant visibility through his campaigns. However, questions about his transparency and the source of his wealth cast doubts on his suitability for the presidency.


Former Minister of Trade and Industry, Alan Kyerematen, also known as Alan Cash, has entered the race under the Movement for Change party after resigning from the NPP. Critics argue that his previous role in the current government undermines his credibility as a candidate for change.


One major challenge facing these new candidates is how they will navigate the legislative landscape dominated by the NPP and NDC. Without a clear strategy to work with the existing parliamentary structure, their ability to govern effectively remains uncertain.


As Ghanaians grow weary of the existing political duopoly, the question remains: who is the third force that can lead the nation forward? Are we merely seeking change at the top, or do we desire a comprehensive overhaul of the system? The need for clear answers and viable alternatives is more pressing than ever.




The demand for ""anybody but the NPP or NDC"" leaves us pondering: So who?

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.
