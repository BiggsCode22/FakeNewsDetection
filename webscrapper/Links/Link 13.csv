Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Address issue of squatters settlements,"Fire outbreaks have become common in certain places in Accra, such as Circle and Kantamanto Market, mainly due to careless behaviour like overloading electricity extension boards or sockets or leaving a fire unattended to.

Since such carelessness persists, particularly in the markets and shanty settlements, it did not come as a surprise when more than 450 wooden structures that served as homes to some squatters along the Circle-Accra rail line were destroyed by fire on Wednesday.

Even though the inferno rendered most of the squatters homeless and destroyed belongings running into millions of cedis, we thank God that, unfortunately, there were no casualties.

However, the June 5, 2024, fire outbreak has come as a painful reminder of the June 3, 2015, fire that erupted at a petrol station some hundreds of metres away from the location of the present fire and killed some 150 people, whose 9th anniversary took place just two days earlier.

Any time there is a fire outbreak in the country, certain problems associated with previous ones are identified.

As we have already mentioned, the carelessness of the people is prominent, but our greater worry is that the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) encounters a number of problems, including difficulty getting fire hydrants in the immediate environs of the fire, and so the firefighters had to travel long distances for water to fight the fire.

It is clear that this contributed to the firefighters taking more than three hours (5:37 p.m.8:57 p.m.) to extinguish the fire.

We can conjecture that since some of the victims could salvage what was left of their belongings, many more of the belongings could have been saved if it had taken a shorter period to kill the fire.

The government should consider providing more fire hydrants, particularly in places where fire outbreaks are rampant.

In addition, the GNFS should be provided with all the facilities that would make it easier for its personnel to get access to every fire and extinguish it, including turntable ladders, all types of fire hoses, firefighting foam equipment, and dry risers.

Also, the district assemblies should ensure that access to communities and markets is not blocked or usurped.

Besides, the Electricity Company of Ghana should make its workers go around town to check for illegal connections and overloaded sockets and extension boards.

While we talk about these things, there is a need to bring to attention the warning the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Mr. Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus-Glover, gave the victims of the Wednesday fire when he said the place was not meant for habitation and that anybody who constructed any structure to be used as settlement there would be arrested by law enforcement agencies.

Much as we do not begrudge him for his warning, we think his office, the regional administration, and the relevant district authorities should first be blamed for looking unconcerned when squatters begin erecting structures for use as homes.

If they are cautioned or stopped initially, they can probably find somewhere else to go and live.

It is time to address the general issue of squatters settlements in the country, but in the present case, the government must come in and help the fire victims, some of whom might have lost some money in the fire in addition to personal belongings.

Probably, the government would have to build some moderate facilities to accommodate these squatters, some of whom contribute to nation-building in one way or another.",,Editorial,  7 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Address-issue-of-squatters-settlements-1934654
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Emancipation Day urges improvement of lives,"Yesterday, the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA) launched the 2024 Emancipation Day celebrations scheduled for July 22 to August 1, 2024, which is the actual Emancipation Day.

Even though Emancipation Day has been celebrated elsewhere, like in the US, for over one and a half centuries, the GTA put the celebration on its calendar of events in 1998.

This is a day marked to commemorate the resistance of African people in the Diaspora against enslavement and the violation of their human rights, which eventually earned them liberation.

That is to say that the day is a reminder of how important it is to allow everyone on the surface of the earth, no matter his or her age and socio-economic status, to live with dignity.

Dignity can be defined as being able to independently shape ones life, including the future, to draw on ones own experience and capabilities, and to live as a respected member of ones social group and society as a whole.

Emancipation Day has become an annual and national event in Ghana, and it appears the focus is on what it commemorates rather than what it connotes.

What the day connotesliving in dignityis a kind of connection between the African forebears who laid down their lives for the freedom of the enslaved Africans and the present generations of Africans everywhere.

This is what should be the idea at the centre of the marking of the day as we organise the various events.

We should remember, for instance, that it took the efforts of former slaves, most of whom had been prevented from even learning to read, to establish schools in the southern part of the US and become educated.

What was more was that freed peoples universal demand for education invariably served as the catalyst for bringing public schooling to the South, and the schools were not only for African-American children but also other children, regardless of race, gender, class, or previous condition of servitude.

Every year, Emancipation Day attracts beautiful themes and speeches, but the aftermath events show that the spirit of resilience to create societies that value living in dignity is missing in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa.

African politicians and their cronies continue to plunder the wealth of their respective countries.

Public officials whose reputations are already a strain on the public purse go further to misappropriate public funds that could have been used to improve the lot of their people and make them feel proud as citizens.

Can the Ghanaian masses and others elsewhere in Africa join those in Switzerland to say they are among the people who live in a state of material well-being and relative safety, secure in the knowledge that the lions share of their basic needs is well covered? The biting poverty, squalor, and lack in every area of life are so pronounced that no ordinary African, particularly a Ghanaian, can sincerely make that claim. 

As the country waits to celebrate Emancipation Day from July 22 to August 1, it should dawn on all its leaderspolitical, traditional, religious, and the likethat the day has a lesson that makes it imperative that they have a duty to improve lives rather than always seeking only their interests.",,Editorial,  5 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Emancipation-Day-urges-improvement-of-lives-1934318
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Make law work in all electoral processes!!,"On Thursday, May 30, 2024, the Electoral Commission (EC) began the transfer of votes, the application for proxy voting, and the replacement of lost or damaged voter ID cards.

The exercise is scheduled to end on Friday, June 14, 2024, but it could be extended because of certain happenings around it.

For instance, just days after it started, it recorded violent incidents at some registration centres, usually clashes between agents of the two dominant parties in the country: the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP).

In the circumstances, an emergency Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC) meeting between the Electoral Commission and the political parties was called yesterday but ended inconclusively.

A careful read of our lead story gives the impression that the meeting ended that way because of the different positions taken by the NDC and the NPP on the matter.

The NDC thinks that should not be the case because the whole idea of the EC is intended to advance the electoral fortunes of the NPP.

Meanwhile, the NPP says that under the law, there is no room for party agents to observe the transfer of votes and application for proxy voting but the voter registration and that it was in the interest of transparency that the IPAC decided that party agents should serve the process, but if circumstances have called for a U-turn, then all stakeholders must abide and allow the process to proceed seamlessly.

It is a fact that democracy cannot eliminate political parties, but it appears members of political parties in the country are always in for their own interests.

The majority of the people have lost trust in politicians because they see how, through corruption, the politicians have made politics more lucrative than industry, such that politicians become richer than business people overnight.

There is suppressed anger among the people, and the only way to stop it from exploding is to change the status and allow the law in every aspect of public life in Ghana to work.

What does the law say about the transfer of votes and the application for proxy voting?

What does the law say about the EC and IPAC?

We remember no one but a former chairman of the EC, Dr. Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, telling the media and, for that matter, the entire world in September 2021 that IPAC decisions cannot be binding on the EC as that would mean meddling with the independence of the Commission.

While we say this to sort of appeal to the NDC to reconsider its stance on the agent matter in the ongoing exercise, we do not rule out whatever fears they have.

We can only say that no party should foment trouble that can put the result of the 2024 presidential election in particular in disrepute and cause violence.

The EC must do well to erase any such suspicions and make the law work in all the electoral processes in the country.

This years election is going to be the most crucial so far because while the ruling NPP is sure of breaking the eight-year cycle of political power that has characterized the countrys Fourth Republic despite the performance of the ruling party, the NDC, accusing the NPP of unprecedented dismal performance for almost eight years, wishes to frustrate that enterprise and take power.",,Editorial,  4 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Make-law-work-in-all-electoral-processes-1934156
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: ECOWAS needs strong, widespread digitalisation infrastructure!!","Digitalization has become indispensable in the world today; hence, it is not surprising that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Resident Representative in Ghana, Baba Gana Wakil, is urging member states to consider digitalization in the socio-political and security landscapes.

For clarity in this editorial, we would take the socio-political landscape to be a combination of social and political issues that relate to the political and social lives of the people.

Examples are matters relating to human rights, economic equality, production, immigration, the spread of development projects, ecology, the environment, democracy, the rule of law, and mass media.

Security can be included here, but separating it from the other socio-political factors may require particular attention, which is important.

In a world today full of crimes, issues of security call for particular attention, especially when criminals always attempt to be ahead of the security services.

Digitalization helps in crime prevention using such opportunities as DNA matching, automatic surveillance using artificial intelligence (AI), and face recognition, and improved digital exchange and analysis of global crime data.

What is critical is that ECOWAS countries should have the infrastructure that would help their people enjoy the benefits of being secured from all manner of crimes.

There should come a time when ECOWAS countries will have digital currencies for all the related benefits.

It is on record that Nordic or Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have efficiently digitised their financial infrastructure so that very few people carry cash.

Such a situation can have huge benefits for ECOWAS countries, where there is more money in the hands of the people than at the banks, resulting in criminal attacks for cash in which criminals even kill in order to take the money from individuals and other sources.

An effective digital currency system can reduce or even eliminate such attacks, and in addition, it can check money laundering, large-scale corruption like kickbacks from companies, tax evasion, and black market activities.

The police can also have effective tracking systems to trace criminals like mobile money scammers.

Digital identities and signatures can also help prevent forgery and corruption.

It is being said that one day all manufactured items used by society will be made smart and connected to the internet and can be programmed to be used by particular people so that intruders like thieves can be traced to the location of the item.

This means digitalization will render stealing a fruitless venture.

With regard to the areas of sociopolitics, digitalization has started impacting life in the ECOWAS space, except that it is not as widespread as elsewhere and also not at the same level among the member states.

But at least, digitalization is evident to some extent in the states, as, for example, all of them use smartphones, adopt digital technologies to do business, hold meetings virtually, and hold political campaigns.

Some state institutions, like the courts, are also automated.

The matter now is that ECOWAS members need a strong and widespread digitalization infrastructure for them to enjoy its full benefits.

And while they think about the benefits of digitalization, they should not fail to consider its flip side, which includes cybercrime and loss of jobs and how to fix them.",,Editorial, 30 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-ECOWAS-needs-strong-widespread-digitalisation-infrastructure-1933399
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let vision 2057 break cycle of national dev. plan non-fulfilment,"Yesterday, the countrys National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) launched a long-term national development framework, Vision 2057, whose collective objective is to elevate the country to upper middle-income status by 2057.

The contents are generally lofty, and what we can describe as its features and objectives are superb.

For instance, it has been crafted to guide the creation of medium-term development plans every four years, ensuring continuity and alignment with long-term aspirations.

It is explained that the sub-plans would inform annual action plans and the national budget, reflecting the needs of all Ghanaians.

Even advanced countries need national development plans to better the lives of their people, and for a developing country like Ghana, this is very critical.

Therefore, Vision 2057 should be seen as a redeemer if it is implemented in a sustainable and consistent manner because it has taken sustainable development to bring Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea, for instance, to the heights they have attained.

This is not the first time the country has adopted a national development plan.

We remember, for instance, short- to medium-term development plans such as the 7-Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development (19631969), the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (20012003), and the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (20042007).

All these and other previous plans were not sustainably and consistently implemented, and so their objectives were not achieved.

Also, we can make reference to the recent Long-term Development Plan of Ghana (20182027), which was a 40-year plan for the country.

What are the reasons for changing or dropping development plans for others?

The first, arguably, relates to different ideals of successive political leadership; otherwise, why the need to replace the 40-year plan whose end date is the same as Vision 2057?

Probably, the various successful political administrations would plead that the national development plans did not align with their manifestoes, hence the urge to abandon them so they could follow their campaign promises.

This situation has not helped the countrys forward march.

No wonder the country is still grappling with problems relating to industrialization, spatial planning, population growth management, infrastructural expansion, and environmental degradation in all its forms and shapes.

When we said early on in this piece that Vision 2057 should be a redeemer, all we had in mind was that it should be a turning point in the development journey of the country.

In that regard, we share the view of the NDPC that continuity should be the buzzword and that future governments should align their projects with Vision 2057 goals, and there should be collaboration among all Ghanaians by contributing ideas and talents to shape the nations future.

However, the question of Vision 2057 also failing cannot be ruled out unless all the hindrances to the success of development plans are identified and vehemently fought.

For instance, since it will take every Ghanaian for the plan to succeed, the culture of impunity in every area of the country must be checked.

Is it not sad that impunity, among other things, has undermined the spatial planning of the country and, as well, made environmental degradation unbearable?

National development planning must no longer be a partisan matter but an issue that should meet the needs of the present generation and be the springboard for future generations to carve their own progress.",,Editorial, 29 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-vision-2057-break-cycle-of-national-dev-plan-non-fulfilment-1933189
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Adopt measures to de-dollarise Ghanaian economy,"Since New York became the financial capital of the world and the dollar officially became the worlds reserve currency in 1944 as a result of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the world has been trading in the dollar.

For some countries like Ghana, which import more than they export, this situation has affected their currencies so much that they always need a certain amount of dollars to stabilise their economies.

In Ghana today, the demand for the dollar is so high that the rate at which it is exchanged for the cedi has become unprecedented in the countrys financial history.

Currently, certain sources say the cedi exchanges for above GH14.00 to a dollar, but the reality is that it is heading towards GHc16.00 once other sources talk of the rate being above GH15.00.

In the circumstances, it appears long-term solutions are not the best options now; hence, the country would have to adopt short-term or ad hoc measures for some time.

Therefore, we cannot help but say that it is good news to hear from the Bank of Ghana (BoG) that it has enough dollars to meet the foreign exchange needs of the country.

We have no intentions to contest this, but our worry borders on why, in spite of the amount of money available, the rate of its exchange to the cedi keeps hitting the skies.

It is clear that the BoG is aware of the causes of the problems, one of which it has mentioned as speculation, and has urged those engaged in speculative purchases of dollars to stop the practice, and that the BoG remains fully committed to providing stability in the exchange rate of the cedi.

Are speculation and stabilising the economy related?

If it is so, then the BoG must do something serious and urgent about the speculation.

We want to take solace in the central banks caution that it has enough foreign exchange reserves to support the market and that economic agents should stop engaging in speculative purchases or they will suffer economic losses when the measures being adopted take effect.

Maybe because we are not experts, we have difficulty appreciating statements and measures because we only focus on what is happeningthe realities that members of the public talk about.

The assurance from the BoG that it has adequate reserves to manage the shocks in the foreign exchange market because of its improved reserve position and whatever strength it has is good, but we expect that the measures to bring down the pressure on the cedi will take effect.

Prices of goods and services keep rising because traders and service providers in the country make reference to the value of the dollar rising against the cedi as what affects their prices and charges.

The popular appeal now is that the BoG and, for that matter, the government should strengthen the steps adopted to have the strongest effect on bringing relief to the masses.

Definitely, the country should not remain in the dollarization web forever, and as a long-term measure, Ghana must pursue what would help it join the de-dollarization movement now sweeping across the globe, spearheaded by countries like China, India, Brazil, Malaysia, and Bolivia.",,Editorial, 28 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Adopt-measures-to-de-dollarise-Ghanaian-economy-1933028
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check African leaders to serve people!!,"Last Saturday was African Union Day (AU Day).

In 2002, the AU was born to replace the Organization of African Unity (OAU), formed on May 25, 1963, by African states, but the May 25 date was not changed.

Thus, every year, May 25 is celebrated across Africa as AU Day.

As usual, the day is celebrated by events, some even preceding it.

Therefore, on Friday, Ghana held a flag-raising ceremony in Accra before Saturday to commemorate the 61st African Union (AU) Day.

Then on Saturday, the African Group of Ambassadors and High Commissioners observed AU Day in Accra to showcase Africas diversity in unity.

Such events are important as they keep reminding Africans, particularly African leaders, of the objectives of the AU.

In fact, it can be argued that the strongest defence for re-placing the OAU was that it was formed at a time when some African countries were still under colonial rule and so had among its objectives the efforts to rid the continent of colonisation and apartheid.

However, OAUs other main objectives could not be discounted as they are relevant now as they were at the time of setting out the OAU Charter, the guide to the organisations activities.

Today, it is still relevant to promote the unity and solidarity of African states; coordinate and intensify their cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for their peoples; safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States; promote international cooperation within the United Nations framework; and harmonise members political, diplomatic, economic, educational, cultural, health, welfare, scientific, technological, and defence policies.

That is to say that the AU is continuing with the major work of the OAU in spite of some changes.

The changes include replacing the Commission of Mediation, Conciliation, and Arbitration with the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, and Resolution in 1993, and the AU Constitutive Act and protocols establishing a significant number of new structures, both at the level of major organs and through a range of new technical and subsidiary committees.

In fact, the AU was established as a body that could accelerate the process of integration in Africa, support the empowerment of African states in the global economy, and address the multifaceted social, economic, and political problems facing the continent.

Since we cannot decouple the OAU's work from that of the AU, there are questions to be asked and comments to be made.

Can the AU account that it has made significant inroads into its objectives 61 years after African countries agreed to cooperate in certain areas as a united continent and one people?

Some of us think the AU has a lot more to do in all aspects of life on the continent.

The truth is that its objectives can be achieved with good leadership, but it is common knowledge that current African leaders have failed their people as they seek their own interests rather than those of their people.

Today, in Africa, politics pays more than industry, making even young talents want to do politics rather than honing their talents for their best benefit.

The AU must, therefore, position itself well to check African leaders to work towards its objectives as expected in each African country to make the benefits or importance of the union tangible to all Africans.",,Editorial, 27 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-African-leaders-to-serve-people-1932853
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fight obstetric fistula with all steam!!,"The call by the First Lady, Mrs. Rebecca Akufo-Addo, for concerted efforts to tackle the problem of obstetric fistula in Ghana to improve the lives of mothers and reproductive health is a pregnant one.

It is pregnant because it concerns the treatment and prevention of the condition, as well as public education about it, including the need to avoid stigmatising patients.

Generally speaking, a fistula is an abnormal connection that joins either two body cavities, like the anus and the female reproduction organ, or one of them to the skin.

A fistula is said to occur when the tissue wall or a barrier between two body parts has broken down, usually due to trauma, injury, or infection.

While the World Health Organization (WHO) says an obstetric fistula is a hole in the birth canal caused by obstructed labour, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) states that it is a hole between the birth canal and bladder or the rectum caused by prolonged, obstructed labour without access to timely, high-quality medical treatment.

The UNFPA information says it leaves women and girls leaking urine, faeces, or both and often leads to chronic medical problems, depression, social isolation, and deepening poverty.

Other sources say it leads to urinary incontinence, pain, tenderness, or itching in the affected area, pus or foul-smelling discharge, fever, and nausea or vomiting.

It is sad to learn that fistulas mostly occur among women living in poverty, in cultures where a womans status and self-esteem may depend almost entirely on her marriage and ability to bear children.

Looking at the fact that the regions in which obstetric fistula mostly occurs include sub-Saharan Africa, where Ghana is located, and the devastation of the condition, the First Ladys call must be given special importance.

The role of women, particularly mothers, in the family and the larger society should call for urgency for everything that affects them in a disenabling manner, particularly bad health and poverty.

Even though the condition is said to not usually heal on its own, proper medical care, such as surgery and wound care, can help treat it.

This means the country must have the relevant medical facilities and well-trained professionals to manage the condition once it occurs.

The government must take this point seriously because the WHO states that obstetric fistula still exists because healthcare systems (particularly in poor countries) fail to provide accessible, quality maternal health care, including family planning, skilled care at birth, basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care, and affordable treatment.

Fortunately, the condition is preventable.

A holistic approach to preventing it is being advocated, and this includes engaging with traditional authorities to understand the causes emanating from some cultural practices like putting underage girls in the family.

Besides, all women should seek medical care regarding fistulas.

Then, the larger society must be educated about the condition.

We believe the country must have all the motivation to fight fistula.

After all, preventing and managing obstetric fistulas will contribute to improved maternal health and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7, which seeks universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information, and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.

Also, that will enhance the countrys image in healthcare globally.",,Editorial, 24 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Fight-obstetric-fistula-with-all-steam-1932496
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Deliver GARID project timely,"It is heartwarming to hear that Parliament has approved US$150 million from the World Bank as additional financing for the implementation of solid waste management, drainage improvements, and other flood mitigation measures under the Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Development (GARID) Project.

It is equally good news that the World Bank is also supporting a broad range of initiatives to mitigate floods and improve solid waste management in the Odaw River Basin.

The project areas captured under the GARID and Odaw Basin initiatives are essential, as they are intended to solve very worrying problems.

Effective solid waste management, good drainage, and other flood-mitigating measures appear to have eluded the country for decades.

Solid waste problems obviously stem from a lack of toilets in homes and public places, which makes some people do open defecation with its attendant health and other problems.

Even where there are good toilets, there are problems regarding where human excreta should be dumped and treated.

Elsewhere, human excreta is used to produce energy, such as domestic gas.

In the case of Ghana, the country appears overwhelmed by the amount of its human waste.

Such waste does not mean only human excreta but also rubbish generated on a daily basis.

Thus, the construction of a waste transfer station and an engineered landfill site must be prioritised.

Definitely, the government cannot shirk its responsibility regarding waste management, and so all stakeholders must give the necessary support for the waste management initiative to succeed.

Now regarding flooding in Accra, we hail the intention to undertake such projects as the repair works on sections of the Odaw Basin, the construction of storm drains in Kaneshie and Nima-Paloma, and the creation of water detention ponds.

The establishment of a flood warning system in the Greater Accra Region is a must.

This is because the region has most of its communities being flood-prone.

But that is not to say other regions of the country are free from flooding.

We, therefore, hope whatever is being done in Greater Accra to mitigate flooding and its devastation will be replicated in the regions to save other citizens.

Everything the government is doing to check flooding is good, but why are flood projects usually done in the rainy season?

We think that must change because they mostly fail to be completed to achieve their objectives.

Besides, some aspects of them are destroyed by the very flood that is targeted to be controlled.

In the end, revaluation is done, and the costs of the projects increase, which is an extra burden on the national budget.

It is the hope of every Ghanaian that the GARID project and related ones will be timely delivered so their objectives will be fully achieved to the benefit of the people.",,Editorial, 23 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Deliver-GARID-project-timely-1932309
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Oil revenue decline must not affect Ghanas development,"The 2023 Annual Report of the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) on the use and management of oil revenues launched in Accra yesterday states that Ghanas share of petroleum revenues for 2023 declined by 25.65 percent due to a decrease in oil production for the fourth conservative year and lower global prices.

The country earned $1.06 billion in 2023; $1.42 billion in 2022, which is the highest so far since the country started commercial oil production in 2010; $783.33 million in 2021; $666.39 million in 2020; US$938 million in 2019; and US$813.95 million in 2018.

Compared to the initial revenuesUS $444 million in 2011; US$541 million in 2012; and US$846 million in 2013one could see some consistency in growth but along the line, some inconsistency set in.

For instance, even the 2013 figure of US$846 million beat those of subsequent years of 2018 (US$ 813.95 million), 2020 (US$666.39 million), and 2021 ($783.33 million).

We definitely know that certain factors accounted for this, as is the case for 2023.

The 2023 decline in oil revenue is due to a decrease in oil production and lower global prices.

Are these the only problems causing the decline in the countrys oil revenues?

What about the quantities of barrels that the country receives as its share of total production?

In his article titled Is Ghana Getting Its Fair Share of Oil Revenues after 10 Years of Production and Exports? published May 24, 2021, Theo Acheampong, one of those who follow the countrys oil production figures, states that Ghana has produced 453.89 million barrels of crude oil from three fields (namely, Jubilee, TEN, and SGN) since 2010.

This was 11 years after the country had struck oil, and out of that figure, a total of 452.09 million barrels (that is, 99.71 percent) had been lifted or sold by all the partners.

What is of interest is that of the 452.09 million barrels lifted, Ghanas share was 78.85 million barrelsthis is 17.44 percentmeaning that the country got less than 18 percent of the value of US$31.62 billion generated from all the lifting for 11 years.

We agree that all this happened due to the agreement(s) reached with the countrys partners in its oil extraction.

That is to say, once production figures go down or up, the country will get its corresponding share.

But the question is, should the agreement stay as it is for the country to receive a paltry share?

We would not be surprised if the relevant public officials came out to defend the agreement as the best so far.

We have not forgotten the hullabaloo about the agreement on the lithium found in the Central Region and how such an agreement was defended as one of the best in the world.

In the face of declining oil revenues, our major concern is the need for the country to explore other viable sources of revenue to support its development.

When the country struck oil in 2010, many Ghanaians had the hope that the fortunes of the country and its people were going to change for the better, but those hopes have become a far cry.

There is therefore a need for the countrys managers to do all they can to restore hope to the people, even if oil revenues fail to pick up.",,Editorial, 22 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Oil-revenue-decline-must-not-affect-Ghana-s-development-1932115
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fix clinical trials challenges in Africa!,"May 20 every year marks International Clinical Trials Day, which commemorates the day Scottish medical scientist James Lind began the first randomised clinical trial in 1747.

Therefore, yesterday was International Clinical Trials Day.

History has it that while aboard the HMS Salisbury, a 50-gun fourth-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy of Great Britain, Dr. Lind conducted what is considered the first clinical trial by administering different dietary supplements prepared from oranges and lemons to sailors suffering from scurvy.

His findings, highlighting the effectiveness of citrus fruits in preventing scurvy, laid the foundation for modern clinical research.

Clinical trials are research studies that test a medical, surgical, or behavioural intervention in people and are the primary way by which researchers determine if a new form of treatment or prevention, such as a new drug, diet, or medical device, is safe and effective.

Often, a clinical trial is designed to learn if a new treatment is more effective or has fewer harmful side effects than existing treatments.

Other objectives include finding approaches to preventing a health problem by testing people who are healthy but at increased risk of developing a disease.

This shows how important such research is.

James Lind deserves every honour for his ground-breaking pioneering work, which has undergone unimaginable evolution to enhance healthcare.

In a world now bedeviled with countless diseases, some of which defy treatment, clinical trials cannot be ignored in healthcare.

Fortunately, today, clinical trials are highly structured and rigorously regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of new treatments.

Besides, it is on record that advances in technology, ethical standards, and global collaboration have significantly enhanced the capacity to conduct clinical research, bringing innovative therapies to patients worldwide.

Unfortunately, however, the records show that despite these advancements, conducting clinical trials in Africa poses some particular challenges.

Africas population is said to be equivalent to 17.8 percent of the total world population of 7.951 billion as of 2022 and bears 25 percent of the global burden of disease, yet only about four percent of global clinical trials are conducted on the African continent.

And the sad aspect of it all is that the four percent trials are unevenly distributed and concentrated in only a few countries.

The sadder part is that, as a result, most medicines are developed through clinical trials conducted outside Africa without considering the implications of their use with African patients or within African health systems.

Key obstacles accounting for this state of affairs are said to include limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and regulatory complexities.

Why does Africa lag behind everything that happens on the globe, however good it is?

Do African leaders care about the wellbeing and welfare of their people?

If African leaders want to toy with things in their countries, those things must not include the health of the people.

Is it not dangerous to allow African countries to use medicines developed from clinical trials done outside the African continent?

It is about time African governments fixed the problems by seriously partnering with the Science for Africa (SFA) Foundation, which seeks to increase investments in clinical research, enhance regulatory frameworks, and foster collaboration between stakeholders.

What is more, the SFA Foundations Clinical Research and Trials Community (CRTC) programme is committed to transforming the clinical trials landscape in Africa through several strategic initiatives, including increasing investments in ethical clinical trials and creating a sustainable clinical trials ecosystem in Africa.",,Editorial, 21 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Fix-clinical-trials-challenges-in-Africa-1931951
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Adopt pragmatic measures, not directives, to stop price hikes!!","Prices of goods and services keep skyrocketing, and the situation appears out of hand in that price changes occur at any time.

 There is a story of a market survey done by the Ghanaian Times published today, and it should not surprise anyone if the figures quoted by the paper go wrong this morning.

 Various factors influence changes in the prices of goods and services, and all these more or less depend on the economic conditions of the country.

 Such conditions may include mismanagement by the government, in which wrong decisions that undermine normal life can be taken.

 This is to say that the government cannot escape blame for the current state of economic affairs in the country if a real on-the-ground analysis is done.

 In the Ghanaian Times market survey story, Dr. Nyaaba Charles, an agriculture expert and Chief Executive Officer of Akuafo Nketewa Company, the Business Unit of the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, says the government has removed subsidies on farm imports such as tractors, agricultural machinery, spare parts, and fertiliser.

 Naturally, this situation is an instance that would cause an increase in the production of food.

 Importers would pay more for those items, and they would transfer the price difference to the farmers who buy from them, and they in turn would transfer the change in prices to consumers.

 If what Dr. Nyaaba is saying is actually what she obtains, then the question is, what informed this decision?

 Did the government officials who took that decision analyse the ramifications?

 It is true that other factors like the profit motive of businesses and individual traders can influence price hikes, but it is believed that the government can and has to do something by way of subsidy, removal of certain taxes, engagements with the business community, and fulfillment of agreements reached at such engagements.

 At the moment, it appears things are not as expected, and so the members of the business community have taken a position that can keep them in operation.

 Quite recently, transport operators insisted they were going to increase fares regardless of the pleading from officialdom to them to shelve that decision.

 What happened in the end?

 We are also aware that just last week, the Minister for Trade and Industry, K. T. Hammond, directed the Cement Manufacturing Development Committee to instruct manufacturing companies to immediately reverse the recent increases in cement prices.

 The Minister further requested the publication of the retail prices of cement by all manufacturers to help stop the continuous, arbitrary increases in cement prices.

 The public is yet to see what would become of this directive if the prices of the inputs for the production of cement kept rising.

 The Ghanaian Times thinks that the directives from the government to businesses in the country would remain charade because of the dollarization of the Ghanaian economy.

 If businesspeople and industries have to import most of their inputs for production and the dollar keeps appreciating against the cedi and nothing economically prudent is done except blaming COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war, the business community would continue to defy directives that would bring their operations to a grind.

 In the end, consumers are the victims, as their incomes remain static, but they must make ends meet.

 The government must intervene with pragmatic actions, not directives that infuriate the business community.",,Editorial, 20 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Adopt-pragmatic-measures-not-directives-to-stop-price-hikes-1931761
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Help educate public on climate change,"Media practitioners everywhere must be aware of problems in their societies and be advocates, educating the public on these problems and also demanding actions for solutions from the relevant quarters.

Since media practitioners are also humans and, as such, suffer from some human frailties, they sometimes have to be prompted to or reminded about what is happening in society and the need for them to act as it is required of them.

Sometimes they have to be called upon to pay particular attention to some specific problems because of their serious effects on society.

Media practitioners must not deem such calls as moves to denigrate them, but ones meant to emphasise how society values the role they can play in its forward march.

Thus, it is not out of place for Akosua Frema Osei-Opare, Chief of Staff, Office of the President of the country, to call on media practitioners in Africa to prioritise advocacy on climate change and other environmental crises to support efforts to mitigate their impacts.

The Ghanaian Times believes this call is paramount because, generally in Africa, those who are supposed to take the necessary actions to address certain problems most of the time neglect their roles because, whether they perform or not, no one will hold them accountable.

In the face of the lack-of-accountability situation, it would take only the media to expose those neglecting the duties for which they are paid by the taxpayer.

Sometimes, it is not as if duty bearers have shirked their responsibilities, but they have challenges they cannot just wake up to talk about for various reasons, and so media promptings create opportunities for them to ease their frustrations.

On such occasions, the media can demand action from the relevant institutions or ministries.

It is also important for the media to inform and educate the public about occurrences that affect their very existence and progress.

Relating these to climate change and other environmental crises to support efforts to mitigate their impacts, we can say that the media must continuously study environmental crises in terms of their causes, effects, and how they can be addressed.

They can then get to know who does what, who should do what, and, if need be, what media practitioners themselves can do to help stem the crises or mitigate their effects.

This is a daunting task because in Africa, due to the diverse perspectives in different societies on even the same problems everywhere, the African media practitioner has to diagnose the particular situation and report on it for effect.

Frema Osei-Opare is, therefore, right to point out that the media should take up the responsibility of informing Africans about the adverse effects of human activities on the environment and the need to protect it.

She is equally right when she says media education is critical in influencing public opinion on environmental issues, as it can positively impact the larger society in combating climate change and other environmental crises.

Elsewhere, society is well informed about climate change and its effects on society, and there are also measures adopted by governments to address the situation.

In Africa, it will only take the media to push for that state of affairs, as the people find it difficult to demand such accountability.",,Editorial, 17 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Help-educate-public-on-climate-change-1931353
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: VAT exemption on healthcare items boost to quality medical care,"The government taxes citizens and businesses to raise revenue to meet their budgetary demands, such as financing public projects.

In Ghana, where the government usually experiences budget deficits and all budgeted inflows fail to come in as expected, it is not easy to grant tax exemptions on a source that is already being complied with.

This is why it becomes a bit curious to learn that the Ministry of Finance will now grant a value-added tax (VAT) exemption on raw materials for local manufacturing of drugs, finished pharmaceutical products, and medical supplies.

But this should not be so surprising because the tax system is not only used to raise revenue but also to make the countrys business environment conducive to the growth of businesses.

In this particular case, everyone hopes that the tax exemption will take immediate effect and boost the healthcare sector in terms of job creation and a reduction in the cost of accessing healthcare.

When health concerns grow, the tax exemption can take care of itself by bringing in returns of multiple values.

However, this is not the foremost reason for the move taken by the Ministry of Finance.

The Ghanaian Times takes particular note of the foremost reason that the move has become urgent due to the dwindling donor inflow to the health sector.

This means that if the donor inflows had continued as expected, the government would have left the players in the pharmaceutical and medical supply sectors of the healthcare industry to grapple with their problems.

As things have turned out now, the Ghanaian Times believes members of the public would like to know what caused the donor inflow to dwindle.

It is an issue that lack of accountability from the Ministry, for instance, can make it difficult for donors to be accountable through compliance with their own governments regulatory requirements and donor reporting.

And this can kill the fire of their philanthropy. Was it the case that some of the donors were suffering risks that affected their reputation and operations?

Could it be a case of implicit bias in which the donors, due to some attitudes relating to a lack of understanding of certain actions and decisions, thought it wise not to bring in their inflows contrary to the countrys expectations?

Maybe the donors lack the financial muscle to continue with their giving to the country.

What exactly was the matter?

While the answer(s) tarry, the Ghanaian Times thinks the annual health summit organised by the Ministry of Health is an important event because it helps to take stock of the performance of the countrys healthcare sector.

This years theme, ""Quality Healthcare Delivery: A Catalyst for Achieving Universal Health Coverage in Ghana,"" is significant as it is timeless.

Quality healthcare delivery is sine qua non (essential) at all times, and this idea must prompt the countrys healthcare professionals to continuously update their knowledge in order to avoid mistakes like giving wrong prescriptions or making patients undergo wrong procedures.

Such errors could be fatal or have long-term, devastating effects. There is also a need for the government to provide the necessary facilities and incentives for healthcare workers to properly safeguard the health of the people, who constitute the greatest asset of the country.

It is also important for the public to take healthcare instructions seriously.",,Editorial, 16 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-VAT-exemption-on-healthcare-items-boost-to-quality-medical-care-1931171
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Save public promises, fix Kaneshie-Kasoa highway!!","Even when there is moderate rainfall affecting the areas bordering the Kaneshie-Mallam Junction-Kasoa highway, traffic congestion builds on this road in unfavourable proportions, but Mondays downpour caused unprecedented gridlock that stretched over 20 kilometres and left thousands of commuters stranded for hours on the road.

The downpour flooded key sections of the Mallam-Kasoa stretch of the Accra-Cape Coast highway, making traffic standstill from Kaneshie.

Those who could not tolerate long waits on vehicles had to make their journeys home hours on foot.

For instance, a commuter had to walk for four hours and 20 minutes (7:00 p.m.11:20 p.m.), covering a distance of about 15 kilometres, from his office at Kwame Nkrumah Circle to his home at New Aplaku Last Stop.

It is public knowledge that the Kaneshie-Mallam Junction-Kasoa highway has peculiar problems that must be fixed.

For instance, it is well known that the Atala area gets flooded at the slightest rainfall, and the stretch from the toll booth (Tuba Junction) to the Broadcasting Junction suffers mudslides, with both situations impeding the free flow of traffic.

There are recorded instances of members of the public calling on the government to fix the highway.

For instance, we can recall an October 2023 demonstration by hundreds of residents of the Ga South Municipality in which they marched on the Mallam-Kasoa highway to protest the traffic situation commuters endure on daily basis, which is compounded when it rains.

The event had the hashtag Fix Kasoa Highway.

Besides, we remember another demonstration one month later in November in which the residents of Kasoa issued a two-week ultimatum to the government to construct a drainage system around the tollbooth and its surrounding areas to facilitate the smooth flow of water during rainfall.

Coming from the same group of Fix Kasoa Highway protesters, the ultimatum was necessitated by the refusal of the government to respond to the earlier demonstration and also for the omission of the Kasoa Highway from the list of roads the government intended to work on, which had been captured by the 2024 Budget and Economic Policy.

Anytime issues about the fixing of roads and any other public infrastructure crop up, public officials are quick to respond that they have plans in place to fix them.

Therefore, it is not surprising that following questions raised about the Monday downpour and the ensuing unprecedented gridlock on the Kaneshie-Mallam-Kasoa highway, the Municipal Engineer of the Weija-Gbawe Municipal Assembly, Dr. Daniel Sowah, has said the matter had been discussed with the Greater Accra Regional Minister-designate, who has called for further discussions on a holistic solution to the problem at hand.

Such assurances have become trite because they have been given many times without being fulfilled.

If Dr. Sowah wants the public to believe him and, for that matter, the government, then the Kasoa highway, which is part of the ECOWAS highway, must be fixed promptly, as seeing is believing.

Ad hoc measures used to fix the road are not the best, and the current poor state of the countrys stretch of the ECOWAS Highway is a blot on the countrys image.",,Editorial, 15 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Save-public-promises-fix-Kaneshie-Kasoa-highway-1931008
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Have a second look at US$25.3 billion NTE target,"The Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA) is praising the countrys performance in non-traditional exports (NTEs) and related earnings.

NTEs refer to products that are new or exotic to Ghana (that is, products not traditionally produced in Ghana) and products that have been traditionally produced for local consumption but are now being exported to foreign markets.

The NTE sector in the country is categorised into three main divisions, namely agriculture, processed/semi-processed, and industrial art & craft sub-sectors.

Thus, cashew nuts, fish, and handicrafts, for example, are exported from the country to the international market.

It is on record that Ghana has become an attractive destination for investments in the West African sub-region because of its democracy and political stability for over 30 years now.

This is good news and one to enhance the countrys forward march, as some state institutions that care about this state of affairs are leveraging the situation for the benefit of the country.

For instance, the GEPA has adopted the National Export Strategy to develop the potential of the NTE sector to make the maximum contribution to GDP growth and national development, consolidate and enhance Ghanas middle-income status, and create job opportunities.

Contribution to GDP growth clearly relates to earnings from NTEs, and currently, the country has set a target of US$25.3 billion by 2029 and is doing all it can to achieve it.

Even though the Ghanaian Times does not intend to fault any state institutions that are stakeholders in this move, the paper thinks that unless something unexpected is done, that target would be far from its achievement.

This position is based on the reality on the ground, considering some earnings figures over some years.

Yesterday, the GEPA announced an 11.75 percent increase in 2023 NTE earnings, totaling US$3,944,146,717.

Even though the 2022 figure was not given, if it is assumed that 11.75 percent is over that figure, then the 2022 figure is US$3.529 billion.

For 2021, NTEs yielded US$3.330 billion, whereas the 2020 earnings amounted to US$2.846 billion, reflecting a decline in the 2019 figure of US$2.899 billion.

As things stand now, the 2023 figure of US$3,944,146,717 is the highest so far.

If we look at the percentage increases in recent years (20192023), which even come as higher figures, we can say the average increase over these years is about US$288 million.

Even if this average figure is rounded off to US$300 million and quadrupled in each year from 2024 to 2029, the mathematics is US$1.2 billion annually for six years, which amounts to US$7.2 billion.

When this figure is added to the US$3.944 billion earned in 2023, the total will be US$11.144, using the hypothetical scenario created here.

In the face of this, the Ghanaian Times thinks the US$25.3 billion NTE earning target by 2029 is highly unrealistic and so must be reviewed.

However, the GEPA is encouraged to put more fire into all its plans towards improving the NTE sector to rake in more earnings for the country.",,Editorial, 14 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Have-a-second-look-at-US-25-3-billion-NTE-target-1930793
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Kumasi airport redevelopment economic prudence,"The upgrade of the Kumasi airport into an international facility and its renaissance as Prempeh I International Airport have messages to engage the attention of the public.

Even though five countries in the world, namely Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Lichtenstein, and the Vatican, do not have airports because of a lack of space, those that do have them should have more for various reasons.

Thus, for example, the United States has 13,513 airports, of which 102 are international, Russia has over 2000, with 67 international, and Indonesia has 673, with 23 of them being international.

Generally, both domestic and international airports facilitate the swift movement of goods, connecting businesses with suppliers and customers.

They are also said to enable perishable products and time-sensitive cargo to reach distant markets quickly.

In particular, international airports facilitate swift movement across countries and continents, thereby supporting global supply chains and boosting the export potential of countries.

Though international airports have domestic facilities attached to them, they are usually larger than the domestic ones as they feature longer runways and other facilities to accommodate heavier aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 commonly used for international and domestic travel.

This was the same idea behind the upgrade of the Kumasi airport when, in June 2018, President Akufo-Addo cut the sod for the commencement of phase two of the project.

Now the facility has a 2,300-metre runway to accommodate Boeing 737-800 series aircraft.

We think that the Kumasi Airport, now named Prempeh I International Airport, would make international travel easier for people from the Ashanti, Ahafo, Bono and Bono East, Northern, Savanna, Upper East, and Upper West regions.

It will save them money, time, and all the hassles involved in coming to Accra to catch flights abroad or land first in Accra on their return from their travels.

For those going to Kumasi, for instance, things will be the easiest.

The new international airport will certainly boost the Ashanti regional economy, which the country can leverage for its progress.

Some businesses can open branches in Kumasi and nearby communities, and new ones can crop up.

The cost of land close to the airport will appreciate.

We can also say beautiful edifices would spring up around.

We, therefore, appeal to the government to speed up the process to tackle phase 3 of the redevelopment of the airport for more benefits to be derived from it.

Above all, we hope the airport will be maintained regularly and upgraded when the need arises.

Now regarding the renaming of the airport, Prempeh I, we think President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has said it all (see story on page 8), and so we will not belittle the point.

However, there is a lesson we want every leader, elected or traditional, to note.

Otumfuo Osei Tutu II is said to have played a pivotal role in the redevelopment of the Kumasi airport, yet he did not fight for it to be named after him.

The Otumfuo has demonstrated real selflessness, which our leaders need; he has given honour to whom it is due.

We commend him for this and recommend this spirit to politicians, even if the honour is due to their opponents.",,Editorial, 13 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Kumasi-airport-redevelopment-economic-prudence-1930621
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Account for GH3 million missing at KMA!!,"The Ghanaian Times commends the members of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA) for raising serious concerns over some GH3 million missing at the assembly and urging a thorough investigation into the matter for those culpable to be held accountable.

At the 9th General Meeting of the KMA on Wednesday, the assembly members learned that a GH5 million loan the Assembly proposed to be secured in the 2021/22 financial year for the Krofrom market redevelopment was increased to GH8 million.

However, only GH4.8 million out of the amount had been spent on the market project, with no record of the disbursement of the GH3 million.

We know cases of this nature are commonplace in district assemblies across the country but are being covered.

Meanwhile, some assembly members, particularly those on the Finance and Administration (F&A) Committee, have neglected their core duty of demanding financial accountability on behalf of their constituents.

The district assemblies were established as an attempt to decentralise the government and to assist in development at the local level.

This means there is the devolution of power to the district level, popularly termed as decentralisation, which puts the development of the districts in the hands of local administrators, including assembly members.

This makes it imperative for assembly members to take a keen interest in every development project in their electoral areas.

But, of course, the Ghanaian Times knows that it sometimes becomes difficult for some Assembly members to get information on projects in their jurisdictions.

This totally defeats the spirit behind decentralisation.

This paper therefore urges assembly members to seek information about every local project, at least from their Presiding Member (PM), who can contact the District Chief Executive if he does not have the required information.

In the face of what is happening at the KMA, such a move is critical because it can lead to stopping some corrupt practices bedeviling state projects or exposing underhand dealings already executed.

If the information this paper has gathered is not an exaggeration or falsehood, then the increase in the proposed loan amount of GH5 million to GH8 million is intriguing and must be explained.

That explanation must be given by those who contracted the loan from the head office of Fidelity Bank in Accra, all because their positions put that responsibility on their shoulders.

Why has Fidelity Bank been declining to clarify the matter regarding the increase in the loan amount from GH5 million to GH8 million despite repeated attempts to get that information?

Well, knowing the sensitive nature of certain issues in banking, the Ghanaian Times would not blame the bank.

However, the paper thinks the bank could have told those seeking the information that, per banking rules, they did not qualify for such information, so they cannot today cite the banks refusal to provide the information in a way that is open to various interpretations.

Will Fidelity Bank take it lightly if some people say it is supporting underhand dealings?

Whatever the case is, the Ghanaian Times commends members of the KMA for helping to grow the demand for accountability from state duty bearers.

This is exemplary and must be emulated by all district assembly members in the country, as well as other citizens.

Every Ghanaian has the responsibility to fight corruption.",,Editorial, 10 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Account-for-GH-3-million-missing-at-KMA-1930221
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Mercury elimination crucial to Ghana,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has urged small-scale miners to stop applying methods that involve the use of mercury and adopt modern techniques to protect human lives and preserve the environment.

The impression has already been clearly given in the call that mercury hurts both humans and the environment, and that makes the call highly imperative.

It is recorded that the artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector is the largest user of mercury globally, emitting 727 metric tons of mercury annually, which accounts for about 35 percent of global air emissions, and releasing about 800 metric tons of mercury into water bodies.

Coming home to Ghana, it is well known that ASGM activities are known for the use of mercury for the amalgamation of gold.

In the case of illegal gold mining, otherwise known as galamsey, research by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found that almost all of the mercury used in galamsey is released into land and water bodies.

The findings of this country-specific research include the fact that mercury poisoning due to illegal mining has affected the soil and the quality of drinking water in communities close to river bodies like the Birim, Enu, Pra, Bonsa, and Ankobra, as they have been badly polluted.

Making the call to stop the use of mercury, the EPA emphasized that the chemical in ASGM causes in the affected communities permanent brain damage, seizures, vision and hearing impairments, stillbirth, deformity among babies, delayed childhood development (stunted growth), and kidney malfunction.

Already, there is the use of mercury-added products in the country, such as manometers, batteries, linear and compact fluorescent lamps, skin-lightening soaps and creams, cement, pesticides, biocides, topical antiseptics, dental amalgam, and thermometers.

There is now an ongoing global mercury phase-out, and so the UN is urging member countries to considerably reduce mercury use or eliminate it.

In fact, in some jurisdictions, such as Zimbabwe, mercury use is illegal, and in others, it is restricted in certain ways.

There is now the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global agreement for reducing mercury pollution.

It recognizes the risks of using mercury in ASGM and calls upon nations to reduce and, where feasible, eliminate it.

The Minamata Convention was agreed upon by more than 120 countries in October 2013 to increase global efforts to significantly reduce and subsequently eliminate mercury releases into the atmosphere, land, and water bodies.

It takes its steam from a mercenary poisoning incident in Japan in 1956, in which more than 2,000 people died; the incident later became known as the Minamata Disease.

Fortunately, there are now alternative ways of undertaking artisanal small-scale gold mining, collectively called mercury-free concentration methods, which the EPA calls tenable.

These are methods used to increase the amount of gold in ore or sediment by selectively removing lighter particles to eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury.

They include chemical leaching, panning, sluicing, and spiral concentrators, centrifuges, magnets, flotation, vortex concentrators, and shaking tables.

These techniques are obviously safer for miners, their families, and local communities, and they are helping artisanal and small-scale miners elsewhere achieve high rates of gold recovery.

As the EPA makes the crucial call, the Ghanaian Times expects that the government will kindle the fire of the galamsey fight and also enforce every piece of legislation and convention addressing the elimination of mercury in the relevant sectors of the countrys economy.",,Editorial,  9 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Mercury-elimination-crucial-to-Ghana-1930015
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Patronise voter registration no matter what!,"We believe the Electoral Commission (EC) has publicised enough of its limited voter registration exercise scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2024, to Monday, May 27, 2024, ahead of the December 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections.

However, we wish to encourage eligible citizens to patronise the exercise to become registered voters who can exercise their franchise in any national election in the country henceforth.

The 21-day exercise is targeted at individuals who turned 18 after the last voter registration and those over 18 who have not yet registered as voters.

It is unfortunate that the exercise took off yesterday amid some incidents.

The most unfortunate one had to do with the technical or system issues with the ECs registration machines, which caused varied periods of delay in the commencement of the exercise at various centres.

Obviously, these problems were unexpected, so the EC must be proactive enough to prevent recurrence or be alert and fast enough to resolve them should they occur again.

Our fear is that, considering their frustrations, some of the yet-to-be-registered voters can call it quits, and the EC would fail to achieve its target of registering 623,000 eligible voters.

This may mean that some eligible voters would have been directly or indirectly disenfranchised, all because the technical problems with the ECs machines frustrated their efforts to register and they developed apathy for the exercise.

We, however, trust in the ECs repeated commitment to ensuring a successful exercise and thus join it in calling for restraints and cooperation from the prospective voters.

Technical problems can occur even when they are least expected.

The incidents involving political party agents at some registration centres also take some shine from the exercise meant to enhance citizens participation in the countrys electoral system.

If the reports reaching our news desk are anything to go by, then we call for the strongest condemnation of the attempt by representatives or agents of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) to get a non-Ghanaian registered at the University of Mines and Technology, Tarkwa (UMaT) centre in Tarkwa-Nsuaem Constituency in the Western Region.

If the police had delayed intervening in the matter, the tussle between the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the NDC could have resulted in violent clashes likely to mar the smooth running of the exercise.",,Editorial,  8 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Patronise-voter-registration-no-matter-what-1929848
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Qualification for 33rd Olympiad wake-up call,"We congratulate Ghanas 4x100m mens relay team on booking their ticket to this summers Olympic Games in Paris after winning Heat 2 on Day 2 of the World Relays held in the Bahamas.

It is heartwarming to learn that the quartet, made up of Ibrahim Fuseini, Isaac Botsio, Benjamin Azamati, and Joseph Paul Amoah, crossed the finishing line in a time of 38.29s, which is their season-best, to book automatic qualification for the 33rd Olympiad.

A big thumbs-up to the quartet for demonstrating resilience and good team chemistry, according to reports.

In spite of all the values of sports, it cannot be dismissed that sports competitions engender rivalry that causes team members to want to always win against their opponents.

If they fail to do so, the fire of rivalry makes them want to avenge their loss at their next meeting.

In the context of this rivalry, we are happy that the victory of Team Ghana was made sweet for sticking to their resolve to fend off any challenge, however stiff, from perennial rivals, Nigeria, to whom they lost their African Games gold at the recent Accra Games.

To a large extent, the rivalry in sports hardly ends in hatred among athletes, and it is moving that Nigeria demonstrated this by joining Ghana to celebrate their qualification with an expression of bountiful joy.

That show of love is the spirit needed in all spheres of life and among all nations in a world full of troubles and uncertainties.

Now regarding the subject of sports, the mention of Ghana readily brings to mind football, as well as boxing, because these are areas where the nation has gained fame.

However, names like Alice Anum ignite memories of the countrys honours in races.

The achievements of Ibrahim Fuseini, Isaac Botsio, Benjamin Azamati, and Joseph Paul Amoah should, therefore, be a wake-up call to the Ministry of Youth and Sports and agencies like the National Sports Authority to consider the gains all sports disciplines can bring to the country and see how to hone talents in those areas.

It is obvious the country pumps most of its resources earmarked for sports into football, and even in the area of football, male football is the focus, to the neglect of female football to a very large extent.

This must change, especially when players of the senior national team, the Black Stars, have begun showing that they have lost the steam of patriotism that can cause them to put up their best performance to make the country proud.

Today, most Ghanaian football enthusiasts love to support European teams because they derive joy and pleasure from their play spirit, which they lack in their compatriots, especially those who play for teams abroad.

The way out now is for the country to provide the appropriate facilities to hone talents in all disciplines, and such training should emphasise patriotism.

Besides, corruption in sports, particularly football, should be strictly checked in order for the country to present real talents at continental and global competitions.",,Editorial,  7 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Qualification-for-33rd-Olympiad-wake-up-call-1929688
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Help sustain the environment!,"On Friday, the world celebrated World Press Freedom Day, and as usual, countries that respect free speech and democracy organised events to commemorate the day, which falls on May 3 every year.

At such events, speeches reflecting the theme of the occasion are made.

It is worthy of note that the global theme for 2024 is A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the Face of the Environmental Crisis, out of which the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) has carved out the local one as Leveraging Journalism for Sustainable Environment and Future.

The role of the media in modern life is very critical because every society has to be well-informed in order to move with time.

A well-informed society is able to understand issues of life, determine their roles as to their contributions to the ills, and decide what to do to advance the progress of society.

For instance, as the fourth estate of the realm, the media has a role to play in governance and, for that matter, democracy.

As the world marks WPFD, we congratulate all journalists around the world, but we extend special congratulations to Ghanaian journalists.

We commend the GJA for acknowledging the fact that environmental sustainability is key to Ghanas progress and coaching a local theme that speaks to the huge environmental problems in Ghana.

We know the world faces a triple environmental crisis, comprising pollution, climate change, and the loss of biodiversity.

The speech of the President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), Mr. Albert Kwabena Dwumfour, captures some environmental worries in the country and so has to be commended.

We join in his call on the media to resume the concerted campaign against illegal mining.

We think, looking at the destruction of galamsey, that call has become so urgent, especially as it appears the fight against that environmental ill has considerably waned.

But galamsey is not the only problem.

Deforestation is equally serious, as it is rapidly contributing to the loss of biodiversity in the country.

There is a need to deal with all causes of biodiversity loss, including unbridled estate development.

There is a need for the government to adopt better housing policies to see an expansion of settlements.

Regarding pollution, we can say it is happening everywhere in the country, unchecked.

Emissions of carbon dioxide, indiscriminate dumping of refuse, and the like are rife.

The recently introduced emission tax appears to have good intentions, but that is not enough.

The government must take a serious view of environmental sanitation and surely check it, like in the olden days when sanitary inspectors could even visit homes and check cleanliness.

When it comes to climate change, it is said that third-world countries, including Ghana, are contributing less, yet we think that less is significant, especially when third-world countries appear not to have enough plans to check some of the causes, like bush burning for farming.

We pray that all stakeholders in environmental sustainability in Ghana will collectively do all they can to, at least, reduce environmental problems in the country.

Let Ghanaian journalists raise environmental issues and educate the public about them.

We also expect the government and its relevant agencies to up their game and sustain the environment for present and future generations.

Once again, congratulations to journalists on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day.

We commend them for their contributions to national development.",,Editorial,  6 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Help-sustain-the-environment-1929488
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Tons of commendations for Appiatses rebirth,"It will be recalled that on January 20, 2022, an explosion occurred at Appiatse, a farming community near Bogoso in the Prestea Huni-Valley Municipality in the Western Region.

The disaster occurred about 300km (180 miles) west of Accra when a motorcycle went under a truck carrying rock-shattering explosives en route to a gold mine at Bogoso.

At least 17 people were confirmed dead, including children and over 60 were injured.

Over 3,300 people were affected in one way or another, and reports from the National Disaster Management Organization indicated that 500 buildings had been destroyed and approximately 1,500 people had been made homeless.

The explosion, which also blew off roads in the area, was a national disaster.

At the end of it all, the whole community of Appiatse was declared to have been wiped off.

As the situation was, it was apparent that the people needed to be consoled and helped, and while some individuals and organisations showered them with relief items, the government promised to rebuild the community.

To prove its resolve to fulfill its promise, the government inaugurated a seven-member multi-sectoral reconstruction committee for Appiatse, the Appiatse Reconstruction Committee, chaired by Mr. Benito Owusu-Bio, a Deputy Minister of Lands and Forestry.

It was tasked with building a green and environmentally sustainable communitya good example of a model town that could be replicated elsewhere in the country.

Since the rebuilding would obviously demand money, the Appiatse Support Fund Committee, headed by Dr. Joyce Aryee, a former CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, was also inaugurated to provide details on how Ghanaians and foreigners could contribute to the Fund for the benefit of the people of Appiatse.

Yesterday, the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, inaugurated 120 housing units for the explosion victims, which he described as the first of three phases of the governments relief efforts.

The Ghanaian Times commends the government for speedily fulfilling, at least, a crucial part of its promise.

The paper equally applauds the Appiatse Reconstruction and Apiatse Support Fund committees.

The members of these committees and their collaborators must have their work etched in the history of the countrys development.

The paper is especially elated that even before the ceremony yesterday, the Appiatse Support Fund Committee had caused the list of its donors to be published in the media space.

The list comprises 79 donors, including politicians, corporate entities, religious organisations, and individuals.

These donors also deserve tons of commendation.

The Ghanaian Times recalls that when it learned that Dr. Aryee was chairing the Appiatse Support Fund Committee, it expressed the hope she would once again uphold honesty and transparency and Appiatse would truly be reborn.

As the whole nation jubilates at the rebirth of Appiatse, we support the remarks by Dr. Bawumia that the ceremony to inaugurate the reconstructed Appiatse was, among other things, to celebrate resilience, compassion, and the indomitable spirit of the people of Appiatse.

We would like to add that even though the disaster they suffered was unpleasant, it has, in the end, brought them something to jubilate about, and they should let this assuage their pains and allow time to heal them.

The people of Appiatse should also note that their once-upon-a-time obscured community is now a global attraction, and so they should keep it green and clean to remain a good example of the model town that it was planned to be.",,Editorial,  3 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Tons-of-commendations-for-Appiatse-s-rebirth-1929106
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Can workers really impact Ghanas electoral, governance systems?","In Accra and the countrys other cities yesterday, workers parades were organized to show Ghanas participation in May Day celebrations across the globe.

Congratulations to all Ghanaian workers in both the public and private sectors!

The importance of organised labour in every economy must be hailed because it takes labour to build a countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the annual total of the monetary or market value of all the goods and services produced in a country.

The GDP, which can also be measured on a quarterly basis, functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given countrys economic health.

It makes it clear that the workers output is the basis of every countrys development.

It, therefore, makes economic sense that workers are treated well by the government for them to put in their best performance to help build the nation.

If this happens, then the government can demand accountability from workers.

Every year, the government has something to say to workers, either as a reminder of what it has done for them or what it expects from them.

For instance, at the national May Day parade held in Bolgatanga last year, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo spoke about the achievements of his administration as far as workers were concerned.

He mentioned, for instance, that years 30 percent increment over the 2022 base pay for public sector workers.

Then, he gave the assurance that his government would protect incomes and pensions in challenging times and mentioned the resolve of his administration to fix the challenges to bring some relief to Ghanaians.

It is up to the workers themselves to state if they are fulfilling that promise.

At yesterdays workers parade in Accra, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo called on organised labour to work toward ensuring that the countrys record as a beacon of democracy and peace is protected before, during, and after the December general election.

He said, Ghanas track record as a bastion of democracy and peace is an enviable one that needs protection.

His call comes in view of the local theme for this years celebration, Election 2024: the Role of Workers and Social Partners in Securing Peaceful Elections for National Development.

The President notes that workers form the backbone of the country and that they have special roles to play in shaping the outcome of elections, adding that your voices matter and your participation in the electoral process is essential to ensuring that the concerns and aspirations of working people are adequately represented in our governance structure.

We think the President has spoken well, and we wish workers voices, for instance, would make an impact in the electoral process and governance space, yet we wonder how effective that could be, considering how certain unseen hands pull strings here and there in those areas.

Besides, there are institutions, particularly the Electoral Commission, given the mandate as to what to do so far as the conduct of elections and governance in the country are concerned, not forgetting how politicians are fond of showing power.

Probably organised labour can raise issues and even go on demonstrations over certain electoral and governance concerns, but can they achieve their targets, especially if things go against the government?",,Editorial,  2 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Can-workers-really-impact-Ghana-s-electoral-governance-systems-1928913
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: NCCE should educate voters on democratic culture,"The advice to voters in the Ejisu Constituency in the Ashanti Region to cast their votes in todays by-election based on their needs for real long-term development in the area is of great essence to the growth of democracy in the country.

Therefore, this important advice from the chairperson of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), Ms. Kathleen Addy, needs to be embraced by all Ghanaians.

However, certain states of national affairs, dubious acts of politicians and political parties in the country, and the tacit push or support of some state institutions make it very difficult for voters in every part of the country to embrace the advice, even if they are willing to do so.

Regarding certain state of national affairs, we can say that the low level of education attained by some of the voters, their lack of understanding of the democratic culture and goings-on in the governance space, the hardships they suffer, their lack of knowledge of their rights and freedoms, and their lack of knowledge of what good things democracy should do for the majority of the people all combine to make the people politically vulnerable for exploitation by politicians.

On top of these and others like them is the situation where the law most of the time punishes the powerless and defends the politicians.

Some dubious acts of politicians and political parties are vote-buying and other inducements to woo voters.

Others include speeches that are meant to threaten or coerce the electorate to vote for certain candidates in exchange for development.

For example, comments that the people of Ejisu would only enjoy development when they vote for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) candidate in todays by-election, otherwise it would elude them, are not tenable.

Democracy should allow voters to make choices rather than get forced to vote for a candidate or a political party against their will.

Politicians and their political parties should accept that every election, general or by-election, is a litmus test for them, so they should always do what is expected of them.

That way, they would not have to struggle so much to get voters to vote for them because the records would speak for them.

Recent comments made in the electioneering in Ejisu and elsewhere clearly point to the fact that the countrys politicians are in for skewed development.

It is sad that those who are bold enough to speak about such bias against their own party members at the helm of affairs are classified as traitors and people not fit to be associated with them.

One sad phenomenon that has come to bedevil politics in Ghana has to do with party communicators.

Instead of these people promising the good things their parties can do for the country and the edge their party has over the others, they mostly drift into vilifying their opponents.

What is most pathetic is that some state institutions that should help nurture the masses into mature democratic beings compromise their roles.

We can go on and on to raise other issues that our space cannot contain.

We know the NCCE is aware of many bad things undermining the smooth or unfettered growth of the countrys democracy, hence the advice that voters should vote based on their needs for real long-term development in their communities.

Voters should refuse inducements and threats and stop being the conduit for the politicians to take advantage to cling to power to shortchange the generality of the people.

Why should the electorate, the kingmakers, allow the politicians to have the power to misbehave and come to deceive them for more power only at the time of elections?

While the NCCE has not been economical about its advice, the Ghanaian Times wishes to remind its officials that they have the biggest role in nurturing the Ghanaian voter in a democratic culture, and this is the time to rise to the occasion and prove the mettle of the Commission.",,Editorial, 30 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-NCCE-should-educate-voters-on-democratic-culture-1928589
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets try male-female presidency,"As we have said in recent times, Ghana will make an unprecedented electoral history this year.

If the New Patriotic Party (NPP) is able to Break the 8,"" that victory would be breaking the jinx about the two-term, eight-year rule enjoyed by the two dominant parties that have altered in ruling the country for almost 32 years in the countrys fourth republicthe National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the NPP.

Today, there is a group called the Alliance for Revolutionary Change (ARC), which has expressed the intention of fielding an independent presidential candidate, and if this candidate wins the presidency, that will be another interesting story.

However, for now, once we are yet to know the sex of the person the presidential candidate of the NPP, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia will choose, we think the most serenading story will be having a female Vice President.

We, therefore, applaud former President John Dramani Mahama for sticking with Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang as his running mate in the 2024 general election.

On Wednesday, the NDC officially unveiled Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, whom Mr. Mahama describes as a woman of unparalleled integrity whose credentials are unmatched and whose passion for Ghanas development is unwavering.

We stand to be corrected, but as a seasoned academic professor who has now chosen to be a politician, Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, so far, has not been involved in any scandal that taints her integrity.

Thus, we are inclined to accept all the good things said about her at her unveiling because they were coming from people who can attest to those virtues of hers.

One significant message we have gleaned from some products of the University of Cape Coast is that she respects everyone and did all she could to encourage her students to understand her lessons and also do personal studies so they could eventually come out as truly educated people.

Her political opponents may attempt to vilify her, but those who know her, we can guess, would dismiss whatever the opponents say as thrash and a figment of their own imagination, such as what one political minion and mischief-maker recently sought to do.

Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang is not being touted as a superwoman; we will equally promote her if Bawumias running mate happens to be a woman.

All we are saying is that we can try a woman as Vice President of the country and see if she will not be the driver's mate but can exert some influence to bring about certain changes in the lives of the people.

The NDC lost the chance to provide that opportunity in 2020 with the same Prof. Opoku-Agyemang.

This was after other noble women had lost it.

Think, for example, about Brigitte Dzogbenuku with Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom in 2016 on the ticket of the Progressive Peoples Party; Mrs. Eva Naa Merley Lokko with Nduom in 2012; Cherita Nana Akosua Frimpomaa-Sarpong with Dr. Abu Sakara Foster (CPP, 2012); Adeline Dedo Nartey with Dr. Edward Nasigrie Mahama (Peoples National Convention, 1996); and Professor Naa Afarley Sackeyfio with Kwabena Darko (National Independence Party, 1992).

We think it is about time the people of this country gave women the opportunity to serve even at the countrys presidency, and it is time to start with the office of the Vice President because of their moderating traits.

The male-male card or combination has, so far, not done the country any better.",,Editorial, 26 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-try-male-female-presidency-1928040
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check schools that violate GES policies,"On Monday, the Ghanaian Times published a story about the dismissal of a 14-year-old Junior High School (JHS) student of Southlane Lake View School, a private institution at Kasoa-Hideout in the Ga South Municipality of the Greater Accra Region, for being pregnant.

Here was a girl who had initially been denied registration for the upcoming Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) but registered following persistent persuasion, yet refused school attendance.

How was she going to learn without a teachers guidance to pass the BECE?

The Ghanaian Times commends the Girl Education Coordinator of the Ga South Municipality, Ms. Florence Antwi-Boasiako, for taking up the matter after this paper made her aware of the issue.

Today, the pregnant girl is back in school, much to the joy of all those who were worried about her situation, particularly her grandmother.

The Ghanaian Times considers a letter of apology addressed to the pregnant child, signed by the headmaster of the school, Bortei Shadrach Borketey, as an afterthought and preposterous in view of the earlier stance of the school that the pregnant girl could not be allowed to study in the same classroom as her mates for some reasons.

Such reasons are flimsy because the very move of dismissing her violates Ghana Education Service (GES) policy on such a matter.

According to the GES, girls who mistakenly get pregnant (such as in the case of the 14-year-old girl in question who is alleged to have been defiled by a 50-year-old man) are allowed to attend school, unless doctors have advised that they stay out of school due to medical reasons.

It appears the authorities of Southlane Lake View School either do not know the GES policies regulating certain matters in basic education cycles or decided to do their own thing, damning the consequences.

The latter reason cannot be dismissed, looking at the peremptory stance of the proprietress of the school, Kate Otchere, shown in her refusal to accept any pleadings, all because a friend of the pregnant girls grandmother had warned her against her decision to deny the girl the chance to continue her education, especially when the BECE was a few months away.

It is clear that the authorities of Southlane Lake View School are nativists, who believe that important elements of understanding the world are innate and do not necessarily need to be learned from experience.

Such a mentality can impute even young people, including basic school children, with the wisdom to know better in all situations.

It is good to hear that the girl and her family are happy now that the girl is back in school, but this paper thinks that is not enough.

The girls family and the Ga South Municipal Education Directorate should monitor how the poor girl is treated in the school.

Some peoples futures have been jeopardised because of the negative attitude of certain teachers and schools.

For instance, some students could not complete school because of unjustifiable treatments like dismissals and embarrassing slow learners instead of receiving regular teaching.

GES officials should be concerned with such matters once they come to their attention, and that is to say, the public must not ignore the ill-treatment of vulnerable schoolchildren but report them for the appropriate action to be taken.",,Editorial, 25 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-schools-that-violate-GES-policies-1927837
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Stop issuing threats, hasten process of fixing fares","Of late, there have been reports of the intentions of transport operators to increase fares, and the whole country is awaiting that.

However, reports reaching the Ghanaian Times have it that some commercial vehicle drivers in Accra (both trotro and taxi) have started charging new fares from the centre of the city to some of its suburbs.

Meanwhile, long-distance drivers are waiting for the process of increasing fares to end before introducing new fares.

The problem now is that the charging of the unapproved fares has resulted in confusion between the erring drivers and their mates on one side and passengers on the other.

While the drivers insist on doing everything possible to collect the new fares, whether approved or not, some passengers are refusing to pay the fares because they have not been made official by way of approval from the appropriate authorities in the transport sector.

Much as the Ghanaian Times is not against an increase in fares, it is worried about the annual chaos associated with the increase, both before and immediately after it.

That means the front-liners in the matter have failed to learn lessons from the happenings regarding an increase in fares over the years.

There is no way even the government can stop the increase in fares since it has not been able to stop the hikes in the prices of vehicles and the inputs used in operating them.

Therefore, the best thing to do is to start planning for the increase in fares long before any groups of drivers or drivers unions start any move that can be counted against them.

Let everyone be honest and say that the delay in addressing issues that directly affect ordinary citizens, such as fixing transport fares, is unacceptable.

Besides, the show of power and authority in such matters must be discarded because it is provocative.

The Ghanaian Times thinks, for instance, that the Ministry of Transport should rather help to hasten the negotiation to increase fares than en-treating the Ghana Police Service and other security agencies to be on the lookout for the arrest of any driver who flouts a directive to drivers not to increase fares, jointly issued by the Ministry of Transport, Ghana Private Road Transport Union, and Ghana Road Transport Coordinating Council, which form the tripartite committee in the transport sector.

Statements like this tend to make those directed at them as well as others display some impunity or raise objections to taunt the power bearers, and this is exactly what is happening now.

The Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana (C-DAG) has called the bluff of the Ministry of Transport over its directive, insisting its members will charge their new fares because transport operators are not charity organizations.

The Chamber of Petroleum Consumers (COPEC) has also chided the Ministry over its directive, maintaining that the Ministry has no power to determine transport fares.

In addition, a former Department of Transport Minister, Joyce Bawah Mogtari, has challenged the Ministrys authority to order the arrest of private transport drivers for increasing their fares because it lacks the mandate to do so.

It is about time principal stakeholders in the transport sector, particularly the Ministry of Transport did the needful about fixing transport fares to forestall chaos involving drivers, their mates, and passengers rather than issuing threats.",,Editorial, 24 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Stop-issuing-threats-hasten-process-of-fixing-fares-1927654
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let the 'Four Betters' improve our well-being,"In one of our last week's editions, we published an article written by QU Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, titled Unlocking Africas potential through agrifood systems transformation and capacity building.

The article was a prelude to the 33rd Session of the FAO Regional Ministerial Conference for Africa that took place in Morocco between April 18 and 20, attended by all the ministers of Food and Agriculture from the African continent.

Mr. Dongyu postulated in his article that the FAO has outlined its strategic vision for the years ahead through the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031, which centres on the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, agrifood systems comprise the entire range of actors and interlinked activities that add value to agricultural production, as well as related off-farm activities such as food storage, aggregation, and post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption.

Indeed, the FAO Regional Ministerial Conference for Africa provides one of the main continental platforms for African governments to share their perspectives and experiences on implementing agrifood system transformation and building capacity.

The conference comes on the back of more than one billion Africans who cannot afford a healthy diet, and this is simply unacceptable. By encouraging better nutrition, FAO is working with countries and other partners to make healthy diets affordable and accessible for all.

According to him, The Four Betters are not just a vision; they are a call to action. They are the pathways through which countries can transform agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable to deliver on the commitments of the Sustainable Development Goals and the post-Malabo agenda.

As against the background, the hike in food prices is throwing so many households into hunger and poverty. We cant agree more with the FAO's statement about the need to implement the necessary policies to ensure adequate food security on the continent to remove our people from the quagmire of hunger and poverty to more prosperous and dignified lives so that no one will be left behind.

In the words of Mr. Dongyu, by encouraging better production through such means as mechanisation, digitalization, agrifood industrialization, and green-powered irrigation, African nations can boost productivity and efficiency and enhance resilience to the climate crisis.

The FAO boss noted that often, Africa presents two faces to the world: one characterized by stereotypes of poverty and hunger, and the other an authentic reflection of this richly diverse and vibrant continent. By harnessing the power of science and technology, enabling policies, and responsible investment, African nations can unlock the true face of the continent: a land of abundance, resilience, dynamism, and opportunity.

He urged African governments to embrace this phase and work together on agrifood system transformation for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind.

Of course, Africa abounds with enormous opportunities to transform societies from the negative narratives of a continent plagued by hunger and poverty to a very prosperous and wealthy continent that their people are proud of.

We at the Ghanaian Times believe our Minister of Food and Agriculture or his representative is back home with fresh ideas to speed up the concept of the Better Fours for the well-being of Ghanaians.",,Editorial, 22 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-the-Four-Betters-improve-our-well-being-1927224
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: We wish Muslims Barka da Sallah,"Over the last one-month period, Muslims across the world went through a spiritual exercise of fasting in the Holy Month of Ramadan, abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset to attain the blessings and mercies of Allah.

Fasting is one of the pillars of Islam, and Ramadan is a time for purifying the soul, refocusing attention on God, and practicing self-discipline and sacrifice.

During the month of Ramadan, Muslims aim to grow spiritually and build closer relationships with Allah by engaging in increased prayer, recitation of the Quran, and acts of charity.

Yesterday, they crowned the month-long fasting with the Eid-ul-Fitr, observed with open prayers to give thanks and praises to Allah for successfully seeing them through this enduring spiritual exercise characterised by sleepless nights of supplications, all in fulfillment of an important pillar of Islam, to seek Allahs blessings and mercies.

The purpose of fasting extends beyond self-restraint from physical needs; it is a time for spiritual rejuvenation and enhancing ones relationship with Allah.

Before going out to observe the open prayers, we are told Muslims offer the Zakat-al-Fitr, a specific charity given at Ramadans end, to ensure that even the less fortunate can partake in the celebrations of Eid-ul-Fitr.

We at the Ghanaian Times want to associate with the Muslim community on this joyous occasion to say Eid Mubarak (Blessed Eid).

We are happy that the youth did not overindulge and get involved in acts that will take the shine out of the celebration.

We believe the celebration embodies the spirit and purpose of Ramadan, highlighting the importance of coming together to honor the values of compassion, gratitude, and mutual respect that are central to the faith.

We are told that Ramadan is not a one-off spiritual exercise to demonstrate an unwavering commitment to the cause of the religion, but the experiences of Ramadan seek to offer lessons and inspirations that Muslims are encouraged to integrate into their daily lives beyond the month of Ramadan.

Muslims are, thus, expected to reflect on the core purpose of Ramadan: to cultivate a lasting spiritual discipline that transcends the month itself, enriching the lives of believers with continuous reflection and devotion.

The elevated devotion and connection to Allah experienced during Ramadan set a spiritual benchmark for personal growth and piety.

This holy month should inspire Muslims to continue the practices of daily prayers, Quran reading, and reflection, aiming to maintain the spiritual momentum of Ramadan.

By carrying forward the spirit of Ramadan throughout the year, Muslims can embody the change we wish to see, fostering environments of understanding and care that transcend cultural, religious, and geographical boundaries.

We are of the firm conviction that Ramadan is an inspiration to Muslims towards a journey of personal growth and collective betterment, making the values of this sacred time a living part of their daily lives.

In doing so, they would have honoured the essence of Ramadan and contributed to a legacy of peace, unity, and compassion that will resonate for generations to come.

We pray for Gods guidance for the Muslim faithful, who form the core of our readership, to continue to uphold the Islamic virtues and be steadfast in their religion.

We entreat them to pray to God to shower His blessing on the country for continuous peace, tolerance, religious coexistence, and prosperity.",,Editorial, 12 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-We-wish-Muslims-Barka-da-Sallah-1925771
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Resolve Global Fund donation impasse to avert health calamity,"On page 9 of our yesterday issue is a story in which the Coalition of CSO Networks in HIV, Tuberculosis (TB), and Malaria is calling on President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to assist in the clearing of locked-up Global Fund-donated health care items at Tema Port, valued at over US$40 million.

These items said to include antiretroviral (ARV), TB medications, and malaria treatments, have been locked up since May 2023.

The Global Fund invests more than US$5 billion a year to fight HIV, TB, and malaria and has been a crucial supporter of Ghanas health initiatives, contributing over US$1.2 billion since 2002.

It is said that despite the Funds consistent aid, the government is demanding exorbitant taxes and port charges for clearing the donated commodities, contrary to the Framework Agreement exempting such charges.

What is more worrying is that efforts by a 12-member Global Fund delegation in March 2024 failed to resolve the impasse, leading to the suspension of all future commodity shipments until the current issue is resolved.

What has been the arrangement since 2002, when the Fund started supporting the country?

Now that this issue has come up, it will do the government good if it makes its relevant representatives explain matters to the public.

This is important and must be done at the earliest; otherwise, those who lack understanding of such matters would conclude that the government is just being callous, particularly because the Coalition says the lock-up has caused a shortage of drugs for treating HIV, TB, and malaria, as a result of which patients are suffering needless deaths.

How much are the duties and port charges accruing from the donations from the Global Fund, a non-profit organisation that cannot be waived when the government can grant tax holidays and other waivers to commercial entities?

The United States (US), described as the Global Funds largest donor, says its support for the Global Fund is a strategic investment in the millions of people whose lives have been saved through Global Fund-supported programmes.

Ghana should think about health first and adopt the US attitude so that even losing revenue for the sake of its citizens would not matter at all.

Meanwhile, it is not strange for Ghana to grant tax exemptions to the Global Fund.

It is on record that a tax waiver was granted to AngloGold Ashanti on December 22, 2010, for its malaria services, and subsequently, the Global Fund Board secured exceptional approval of extensions of the programme until the end of 2015.

Why can such an exemption not be granted to the Coalition of CSO Networks this time around?

Even there is a general principle that for each programme, the purchase and/or import of any goods or services using the grant funds shall be exempt from relevant taxation applicable in the host country, including but not limited to customs duties, import duties, taxes, or fiscal charges of equal effect levied or otherwise imposed on the health products imported into the host country under the Grant Agreement.

Even where certain taxes are paid, refunds must be made to the Global Fund.

The government must think of the more than 250,000 individuals living with HIV who depend on Global Fund-sponsored ARVs, the expiration of some of the drugs, and the impending loss of Global Fund support and urgently do something to avert any looming health calamity.",,Editorial, 10 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Resolve-Global-Fund-donation-impasse-to-avert-health-calamity-1925455
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Support Justice Torkornoo to bring honour to Ghana,"On June 12, 2023, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, as mandated by the countrys 1992 Constitution, swore in Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo, a Justice of the Supreme Court, as the Chief Justice (CJ).

After taking office as the 15th CJ of the country and the third female CJ after Justice Georgina Theodora Wood (20072017) and Justice Sophia A. B. Akuffo (201720202020), Justice Torkornoo said she would do well to rebrand the judicial system in Ghana to deliver robust and cost-effective services to increase public trust in the courts.

Yesterday in Accra, Justice Torkornoo launched an initiative dubbed Leading Justice: a strategic framework for increasing legality, ethics, assets, digitalisation and due process in justice delivery.

We once again congratulate Justice Torkornoo on her appointment and on being the first Chief Justice to launch such an initiative to enhance the quality of justice delivery nationwide.

Our story on page 9 gives a fair glimpse of what the CJ hopes to achieve.

Highlighting the use of technology, particularly digitalization, as part of her vision to bring justice to the people, Justice Torkornoo has clearly sent out the message that she is in tune with current happenings in her chosen career.

We are also aware of Justice Torkornoos vast experience, including being active in the core reform agenda and activities of the Judiciary and the Judicial Service of Ghana (JSG) since 2005; serving as a judicial leader in the development and oversight of a number of reform projects of the Judiciary involving the European Union, USAID, DFID, and collaborations with other African countries; and being involved in reforms in streamlining Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in commercial justice delivery in circuit and high courts that led to the passage of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Amendment Rules 2020 (CI 133) in the country.

And, of course, we do not discount the ability of Justice Torkornoo to acquire new knowledge and skills to enhance her performance.

We, therefore, join her in her appeal for the necessary assistance from the relevant institutions for her to deliver.

For instance, her request for increased budgetary allocations to the judiciary to expand infrastructure on the automation and digitalization agenda must constantly capture the attention of the Ministry of Finance.

Justice Torkornoo has made her vision clear, and this makes it easier for the sources of assistance to begin to think about what they can do to help her even before she officially or officially approaches them.

That goodwill will help Justice Torkornoo deliver as expected and possibly even beyond what she has envisaged.

The Ghanaian Times stands ready to trumpet the CJs feats once it gets to know about them.

Those of us working on the paper know that though Justice Torkornoo will be accorded some honour for her success as the Chief Justice, Ghana will be accorded the bigger honour in the community of nations if its judiciary is run well.

As we hail you, Justice Torkornoo, we wish to make this single appeal: Kindly do well to stamp out corruption from the justice delivery system and make all Ghanaians equal before the countrys laws.",,Editorial,  9 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Support-Justice-Torkornoo-to-bring-honour-to-Ghana-1925275
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ghana can be best in governance in Africa,"The Ghanaian Times receives as good news the fact that Ghana has been ranked the best-performing country in governance in West Africa according to the recent World Economics Governance Index report.

It is similarly good news that the report by World Economics Research, based in London, also places the country fifth in its overall position in Africa.

First of all, the Ghanaian Times deems it an honour, as always, to praise the state of Ghana and her people for achievements that resulted from the efforts of the political establishment as an entity, relevant institutions, and the people as a whole.

It is a great joy to learn that after providing the indicators that helped the country achieve that feat, such as political stability, rule of law, accountability and government effectiveness, consistent efforts in upholding democratic values, ensuring transparency, and promoting inclusive policies, the report acknowledges the healthy participation of Ghanaians in democratic processes.

All Ghanaians should take pride in the fact that the report takes particular note of the interaction of the citizens with established institutions, laws, and the elected actors of governance within an atmosphere of tolerance.

Our cherished readers, particularly those who follow political goings-on in the country and across Africa, can give their own examples of fellow African countries whose politicians and political institutions have compromised democratic values such that election periods are times to be on tenterhooks. Is it not heartwarming to learn that the countrys ranking reaffirms its commitment to democratic principles and effective governance systems, reinforcing its status as a beacon of stability and progress in the West African sub-region?

It is good to hear that the governance evaluation considered factors like political rights, law and order, press freedom, and corruption to place the country in a respectable position in grade B with a score of 61.7.

This paper thinks the country could have done better if certain checks had been done.

There are certain happenings in the country that must be checked to improve its future scores because it is a fact that other rating institutions can rank it differently if they pay particular attention to the insolence and disregard some politicians exhibit towards journalists, for instance.

It is also the case that the citizens have issues with how law and order work in the country.

Any future rating should delve deep into whether justice is skewed in favour of some against others.

That can inform those in charge of the law and order to make amends for everyone in the country to believe in its justice system.

As a paper that desires news that says it as it is, the Ghanaian Times wishes not to dispute whatever research has been confirmed until proven otherwise by another research.

However, as a paper that observes significant happenings in the country, it wishes to state that the countrys proactive approach to combating corruption and promoting transparency is not working as expected.


The media space is awash with news of corrupt practices involving public officials, and the Auditor Generals annual reports are a good source of such information.

It is about time for the powers to fix the shortfalls in the countrys governance for it to be at the top of the rankings in Africa as a whole.",,Editorial,  8 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ghana-can-be-best-in-governance-in-Africa-1925084
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Embrace measures to avoid budget overruns,"Budget overruns constitute one huge public financial management problem in Ghana.

In spite of budgets prepared for various state projects, the problem recurs and is worst in election years when politicians want to complete particular projects to attract votes.

Since overrun occurs when the actual cost of a project exceeds the estimated or budgeted cost, it means that the state is going to pay more than it should be.

However, the problem does not end there, as the overrun can cause further problems with the projects scope, schedule, quality, or risk management and affect the projects profitability, stakeholder satisfaction, and competitive advantage, according to studies.

For instance, a few months after their handover, roads hurriedly done in election years begin to develop defects like potholes.

At the end of it all, the unbudgeted funds pumped into the construction of such roads have gone to waste because, in no time, the need to reconstruct them arises.

These and other reasons are why we support the appeal from the Minister-designate for Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, to the Chief Directors and Heads of all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to ensure strict compliance with their stated budgets for this year, a general election year, in order to curtail overruns.

He was magnanimous enough to show the Chief Directors and the other heads how to implement the appeal, and this is very important.

He says it is imperative that they engage their political heads and not commit to projects that have not been budgeted for, no matter which quarter they are coming from.

Going by what the minister-designate is saying, we can conclude that the appeal is part of a government expenditure reform on the way.

This means that when finalised, the reforms are going to be embodied in public expenditure policy, which must be respected by even the President of the country.

All stakeholders working on such reforms and the subsequent policy must, therefore, attach urgency to the process and bring some restrictions to ensure prudent expenditure to save the Consolidated Fund from constant stress.

The Ghanaian Times commends the minister-designate for his concerns, but it seems this step is long overdue.

Public duty bearers, particularly politicians and heads of covered entities, have taken advantage of and exploited the situation for far too long, which has hurt the countrys financial strength.

We do not understand why the incoming minister should count on the Chief Directors and other heads to engage their respective political heads on the governments policy direction to ensure the effective implementation of the measures at their various entities.

We think the best thing to do is to call the political heads to a meeting and sensitise them to the ramifications of their budget overruns.

If really politicians are providing service to the people without any ulterior motive, as they claim, then here is one occasion to prove their selflessness.

In that case, we also think there is a need to sensitise the public and understand why certain projects must wait until the appropriate time.

And while this is being done, there is a need for the government to check for factors that typically cause budget overruns, such as delays in payment to contractors, project variations, inflation, and schedule slippage.",,Editorial,  5 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Embrace-measures-to-avoid-budget-overruns-1924710
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Prepare to heed forthcoming ban on noise-making,"The Ga Traditional Council (GTC) has announced that this years ban on drumming and noise-making within the state will commence on May 6 and run till June 6, a one-month period.

The Council specifies that the ban prohibits noise-making activities, including clapping of hands and the use of tambourines and other musical instruments during the period.

Thus, churches, mosques, and pubs, for instance, are expected to refrain from the use of musical instruments, placing loudspeakers outside their premises, and carrying out open-air activities.

Roadside evangelists are also expected to cease their activities during this period.

Other open-air activities banned include funerals, as they also involve noise-making.

The Ghanaian Times joins the GTC in urging the public to observe the ban to uphold peace, harmony, and security within the Ga State.

It, therefore, appeals to religious and other traditional authorities within the Ga State to show respect by restraining their followers from making derogatory and inflammatory remarks about the ban.

The truth is that not all cultures and traditions of a people are bad.

This is where there is a need to seek an understanding of such practices, but not as in the case of the 12-year-old girl being married to an old man, which is a clear violation of the innocent girls rights.

Seeking an understanding of harmless but sometimes unclear cultural practices like the annual ban on noise-making prevents some people from trying to violate them because they do not see the essence of them.

The ban on noise-making, for instance, is observed because, in ancient times, the Gas were involved in farming and planted their seeds during the period. It was found that noise-making interfered with seed germination, so the one-month ban could help stem the interference.

It should marvel at the present generation how the ancient Gas came to that conclusion as primitive as they were thought to be.

Interestingly, research in modern times has proven that sound or noise has some impact on plant growth.

For instance, ResearchGate, a European commercial social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, states that depending on the frequency and intensity of SV (structural variation) and US sounds [or noise], they can positively or negatively affect different biological functions of plants such as germination, the cell cycle, shoot, root, and callus growth and development.

Today, a greater percentage of Ga lands are built up, meaning farming is less practiced in the state, yet the ban on noise-making has some significance.

If nothing at all, it reminds everyone of the intellect of the Gas, which can be applied in farming communities today with the assistance of agricultural scientists.

Ghana is an agrarian country, and any knowledge or technology that can enhance its agricultural production must be encouraged.

The rite may appear obsolete but not harmful, and it can be observed for as long as the Ga people want to deem it worthy.

Besides, it forms part of who they are.

The Ghanaian Times will continue to support all cultural practices in the country that help it develop, even if they have just some productive lessons for the people.

In that same vein, the paper will join the condemnation of obnoxious, restrictive, outdated, and harmful ones like minors being married to paedophiles.",,Editorial,  4 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Prepare-to-heed-forthcoming-ban-on-noise-making-1924554
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Smart schools project deserves particular attention,"Since education is touted as being the key to every countrys development and both education and development are dynamic, there is a need to always make education in tune with the current circumstances.

Therefore, the launch of the Smart Schools Project in the country, an initiative of the Ministry of Education with support from the Centre for National Distance Learning and Open Schools (CENDELOS), is very appropriate.

This is a project designed to equip students in the country with the requisite technological skills and know-how for modern educational achievement.

To make the project a reality, the government is set to provide about 1.3 million students with a tablet each and go ahead to construct 100 smart schools across all the countrys 16 regions to provide a modern learning environment and digital training.

Besides giving the public a firm assurance of its resolve to carry through the project, the government has provided the names of the 100 places where the smart schools will be located and the timelines for their completion.

The first 30 will be completed by the end of this year, and the remaining 70 in the next two years.

We do not know how much each of the schools will cost, but considering the high cost of goods and services in the country currently and the facilities to be provided in the buildings, as well as the dollarization of the economy, we can guess even the first 30 are going to cost millions of dollars, translating into billions of Ghana Cedis.

It is an open secret that public projects in the country are bedeviled with much corruption by way of over-invoicing, for instance, whose impact on the execution of the projects is dire.

Over-invoicing can inflate the cost of the project, and this, coupled with ever-increasing prices of goods and services, can throw the cost out of gear and stall the project.

Looking at the importance of and urgency of smart schools, we appeal to the Presidency and the Ministry of Education to pay particular attention to their construction and provision of the relevant facilities.

Just think about the fact that the project is in fulfillment of the UNs Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which is aimed at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.

In spite of the huge progress the Akufo-Addo government has made in the education sector, in terms of SDG4, the country is far behind time, so any acts that can draw the country further back must not be countenanced at all, not even in a small measure.

The Ghanaian Times is very much elated generally about the smart school project but particularly about the fact that the school buildings will be fitted with solar panels to have them off the national electricity grid.

Thus, hopefully, they will not suffer disruptions in energy supply, and with the infrastructure going to be made to meet the countrys unique climatic conditions, no doubt, the smart schools will provide a conducive atmosphere for teaching and learning.",,Editorial, 27 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Smart-schools-project-deserves-particular-attention-1923438
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Review road safety control measures,"Since its establishment, the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) has been organising campaigns to ensure road safety in the country.

Of particular note are the special Christmas and Easter campaigns organised annually to remind drivers of their responsibility to save lives while discharging their duties.

Last Friday, the NRSA, in partnership with the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, launched in Accra the 2024 Stay-Alive Easter Campaign.

At the launch, the NRSA asked drivers to strictly adhere to road safety regulations to prevent road crashes during this years Easter festivities, which begin this Friday until next Monday, April 1.

What the whole thing means is that there will be an increase in passengers this week, and a good number of people will travel to their hometowns and elsewhere for the festivities and return to base afterward, which causes drivers to want to employ all means possible to increase their takings.

Even though the NRSA believes strict adherence would help reduce the number of cases of road accidents, deaths, and injuries in the country during the festive period, we think the previous campaigns have not helped much, as the statistics show on average that the country consistently experiences increases in road crashes.

For instance, available statistics indicate that 2,260 crashes involving 3,910 vehicles have occurred in the first two months of this year, compared with 2,249 crashes involving 3,857 vehicles during the same period last year.

The sad thing is that while last years clashes killed 330 people, injured 2,502 people, and recorded 382 pedestrian knockdowns, this years (2024) have killed 369, injured 2,552 people, and knocked down 381.

The 2024 increases over the 2023 figures in percentage terms are 0.49 percent for crashes, 1.37 percent for vehicles involved, 11.82 percent for fatalities, and 2.0 percent for the injured.

Drivers in the country keep defying road safety regulations as the major causes of crashes remain mostly human errors.

These errors are mostly fatigue, drunk driving, reckless driving, including wrong over-taking.

At this juncture, we think three things should be the focus of road safety in the country: driver education focusing on the psychology of the driver, the strict management of the leadership of drivers unions as well as vehicle owners, and truly punitive laws.

Has the NRSA taken note of the types of drivers in the country and pointed out this in the bid to educate drivers, vehicle owners, and drivers union managers or leaders?

Like all humans, drivers exhibit certain negative traits, but their cases are normally more dangerous because they are doing so on the road.

We have, for instance, fatigued drivers who, despite their tiredness, would still insist on driving.

What about distracted, rushed, emotional, and new/inexperienced drivers?

Let us get to know who all these drivers are and use their traits to educate them and other stakeholders.",,Editorial, 26 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Review-road-safety-control-measures-1923281
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Provide enough sports facilities to hone talents,"The Ghanaian Times is delighted that the 13th African Games, Accra 2023, which the country hosted from March 8 to 23, 2024, have come to a successful end.

Many would agree that the 16-day event is historic for various reasons.

It recorded no incident that could have taken away its shine; the complaints about the hockey pitch raised by the South Africans were flimsy and so had no effect.

Also, the foreigners who came to the country for the sports festival did not complain of ill-treatment, which means that Ghanaian hospitality has been demonstrated.

It is our hope that the over 5000 athletes and their officials, as well as others like international sports officials and foreign media personnel, can testify to the festivals billing.

We congratulate all these people on helping to make the festival a success, but special compliments to our medal winners.

Also, we extend heartfelt congratulations to Egypt for earning the right to host the festival for the second time in Cairo, from January 20 to February 7, 2027, having hosted the 1991 Games.

For Ghanaians, it was a great pride that their country should host the games for the first time, with its athletes displaying sterling performances.

The country won 68 medals, comprising 19 gold, 29 silver, and 20 bronze, with the medal haul being described as the largest so far in its history at the prestigious continental event.

The outstanding performance caused President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to extend wholehearted congratulations and gratitude to the countrys team (including the coaches, officials, and support staff), and he did this in a speech he delivered at the official closing ceremony held on Saturday.

A quote from his speech sums it all up, and we reproduce it here: To each and every member of the Ghanaian team, I commend you for your dedication, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to excellence. Your excellent achievements have not only brought glory to our nation but have also inspired a new generation of sportspeople across our beloved country. You have showcased the best of Ghana to the world.

While we join the President in commending those who helped to show the countrys glory on the continental sports platform, we want to take note of the reaffirmation of the governments commitment to promoting sports as a tool for national development and unity by harnessing its power to build a stronger, healthier, and more prosperous Ghana for generations to come.

We do not want to take this as a mere comment but one that must be made to materialize, and if it will materialise, then preparation for it must start now.

Ghanaians are tired of empty promises, the ineptitude of those in charge of sports development in the country, including the Ghana Football Association, and corruption in the sector.

These must cease forthwith, and the provision of facilities to constantly train athletes should be provided in all districts, while sports at the school, community, and district levels must be enhanced to hone talents in all sports disciplines.",,Editorial, 25 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Provide-enough-sports-facilities-to-hone-talents-1923097
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Heed Asantehenes advice regarding road contractors,"The importance of roads is synonymous with that of the road contractor, but the contractor can make this importance a reality with money to execute road projects.

However, it is common in Ghana that the government defers payments to contractors for reasons public officials deem fit; prominent among them is a lack of funds.

Sometimes payments can be delayed for a year, two, or more.

Contractors themselves and even some community members have complained about the problem of non-payment to road contractors due to the ramifications such as delayed or stalled work, layoffs, mounting interest on loans offered to contractors, and their inability to pay their suppliers.

Besides, sometimes some contractors suffer mistrust and threats from their workers, who think the contractors have received payments but do not want to give them their due.

A case in reference is the one in which the government failed to honour its promise to pay cocoa road contractors by the end of 2022, but their creditors, suppliers, and employees thought they had been paid and so started chasing them in early 2023.

Thus, on March 8, 2023, members of the Concerned Cocoa Road Contractors Association of Ghana marched to the office of the Ghana Chamber of Construction Industry for an emergency meeting with the leadership, where they threatened to take legal action if the money owed them was not paid by mid-April last year.

The contractors cannot be blamed for such agitations because sometimes some of them suffer starvation and health problems because they have spent their money on the projects they either executed in full or to a certain stage.

Oftentimes, one wonders why government officials treat contractors that way as if they are not aware of the suffering they cause the contractors, their suppliers, creditors, and workers, as well as families and communities.

Many are those who have spoken against the situation to no avail, so now the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II himself, has added his voice.

The Asantehene has called on the government to reconsider its payment methods to prevent situations where projects are left unfinished due to financial constraints.

He suggests that payments to road contractors should not necessarily be made in bulk but in bits or installments to provide them with the financial capacity to meet project completion deadlines.

Otumfuo Osei Tutu believes that when debts accumulate, it becomes very difficult to effect payment.

In Ghana, traditional leaders and the elderly wink at certain situations until they find it necessary to intervene in them.

This is exactly what Otumfuo has done, and there is no doubt that his voice carries enormous weight in national development.

We, therefore, believe that his intervention should change the status quo to bring some relief to contractors and all those who look up to them for one thing or another.

The change would also save the government all manner of embarrassment, such as when public officials have to be referred to for their failed promises to complete certain projects and the hardship they have caused the contractors and those they are accountable to in various ways.",,Editorial, 20 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Heed-Asantehene-s-advice-regarding-road-contractors-1922361
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check internal factors to fix countrys economic woes,"It is now common knowledge that in May last year, the IMF Executive Board approved a US$3 billion 36-month extended credit facility arrangement for Ghana, out of which the global financial institution has so far disbursed two tranches of $600 million each.

Currently, the Managing Director (MD) of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, and a team are in the country to conclude the second review of the programme, whose successful completion will facilitate the release of the third tranche.

At a bilateral meeting on Sunday, the Minister of Finance-designate, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, assured the IMF team of Ghanas commitment to keeping to the IMF programme in order that it would not be derailed.

We can fathom that this assurance is obviously coming as a result of the reshuffling of Mr. Ken Ofori Atta, the finance minister who started the process with the IMF.

It can also be a way of making the IMF accept that it is dealing with a state and not an individual.

On that score, we can conclude that Dr. Amin Adam is well aware of all the demands or conditionalities undergirding the successful completion of the programme.

Since the whole programme is about stabilising the countrys economy and stabilisation has to do with how well the economy is managed, we are happy to hear Dr. Amin Adam say, I will be aggressive on the revenue side and hold the line on expenditure.

We know the country is suffering financial stress because of financial mismanagement due to misappropriation and misapplication of state funds, overspending, and corruption.

For instance, in August 2019, www.occrp.org reported that Ghana had been losing US$3 billion to corruption annually, and in May 2022, chraj.gov.gh reported that corruption swallows 20 percent of the countrys budget. We are calling attention to information like this to remind the Minister of Finance-designate that he has an uphill task ahead of him.

Therefore, he should immediately plan how he would get stakeholders like the Ghana Revenue Authority, the Executive (the President and his inner circle), the Auditor-Generals Department, the police, the Attorney Generals Office, the judiciary, and even the media to help him succeed.

The reference to COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war must stop because some of us see it as a flimsy excuse to avoid tackling the countrys major problem: failure to mobilise enough revenue and yet public officials penchant to overspend.

For how long should the country borrow? Usually, overspending results from excessive remunerations paid to public officials and over-ambitious state projects, which usually delay and call for re-evaluation that raises the cost.

We think at this juncture, we want to make reference to a remark by the IMF MD at Sundays meeting to the effect that Ghana has very bright prospects, and we need to do the right thing now for these prospects to materialise.

It is our hope that the government will adhere to the right steps, including policies that will promote the expected resilient and inclusive economic growth.",,Editorial, 19 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-internal-factors-to-fix-country-s-economic-woes-1922166
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Swift response to school problems paramount,"We commend the Minister of Education, Dr. Osei Yaw Adutwum, for tasking certain special teams to all regions of the country to ascertain the true state of affairs in connection with food supply in senior high schools (SHSs) and technical and vocational education and training institutions in the country.

His action follows reports and speculations about the irregular distribution of food items to SHS and TVET institutions across the country. In addition to the feedback from heads of schools and students, the teams checked the storage facilities and found that all the schools had an adequate stock of food.

The ministers approach is scientific as it captures the true state of affairs, and such an approach is what we expect all ministers and other leaders to adopt to solve problems in their jurisdictions.

Anything short of a scientific approach would not help in adopting the right measures to solve the problems or provide the expected response. This can worsen matters and bring embarrassment to a minister of state or any other leader, as it happens at times.

We know the minister is not the only public official doing that, though, and we encourage leaders at the helm of affairs across the country to be fond of the scientific approach to solving problems and make it a habit henceforth.

The benefits are enormous, including helping to dismiss rumours and propaganda, saving oneself embarrassment, and putting the minds of stakeholders at rest.
In the case of the education ministers move, for example, we believe parents of students at public SHSs and TVET institutions and other stakeholders in the education sector would have some relief.

Concerning the quality and quantity of food served in the schools, we wish to appeal that there must be regular unannounced checks because some of the stories in the public cannot be all mere rumours.

After all, there have been stories of thefts of food items by matrons and other kitchen staff members, which cause a reduction in the quantity of ingredients for preparing the food and subsequently the amount, quality, or taste of the food prepared.

According to the Ministry of Education, to ensure food security in the schools, there was prompt and up-to-date payment of funds allocated for the purchase of perishable food items for all schools. It is not clear whether the payment was affected by the food shortage rumours.

Whatever the case is, we hear of heads of schools complaining about the late release of such funds, which definitely affects the quantity and quality of food given to students.

We, therefore, wish to suggest that such releases be done in good time. The Ghanaian Times hopes the ministry will continuously honour its promise of considering any school that has a peculiar challenge concerning food supply as a special case and treating it urgently.

It is only when the ministry provides a swift and hands-on response to school problems that parents and all other stakeholders in the education sector will have confidence that the government prioritises the welfare of students, including the overall enhancement of their food security.",,Editorial, 18 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Swift-response-to-school-problems-paramount-1921974
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Oti people must heed peace admonition,"We encourage the feuding factions in the communal conflict at Nkwanta in the Nkwanta-South Municipality of the Oti Region to heed the advice given to them to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue to settle their differences amicably.

The admonition from the Oti Regional Minister-designate, DSP Daniel Machator, must be evaluated and embraced in the face of its underlying reason.

He says the development of the region depends on peace, which is a prerequisite for progress, and so it has now become imperative that all disputes in the region be addressed amicably for a conducive environment to spur the regions development.

It is not a good commentary that the region is entangled with chieftaincy and other conflicts that would lead to tension and unrest, thereby posing a significant threat to the development of the region.

We think the minister-designate is being magnanimous in his choice of words when and if he says, The conflicts would lead to tension and unrest.

We recall, for instance, that in a renewed tribal conflict involving the Challah, Akyode, and Adele people at Nkwanta, the capital of the Nkwanta South Municipality of the Oti Region, in November last year, four people were shot dead and others injured in a day.

The fighting also resulted in the burning of some houses in the town.

Consequently, some people fled the town and were displaced elsewhere.

This is a picture of what conflicts can do, and so even though we have to be careful in our choice of words when dealing with conflicts in order not to inflame passions, we must be ready to be forthright with the facts.

Even though we agree that all factions in conflicts have their vested interests, they should accept that it can take only an amicable settlement to serve the larger good, which obviously is what all the factions actually aim at.

There can be elements in all factions who would do everything to hinder efforts for peace because of their parochial interests.

Therefore, the factions must not be conscious of only what they actually want addressed but also those of their opponents, so the spirit of consensus can reign in every negotiation.

That way, it would be rare to have many conflicts taking root and festering in the country.

Unfortunately, that spirit of consensus-building has been ignored, making conflicts fester and resulting in all manner of unpalatable situations.

Think of the loss of lives and property to needless conflicts, as well as the loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.

What can be more painful when you are forced to leave your native home or a place you have chosen to be your home?

You would have to start life afresh at your new settlement, with all its attendant problems.

More importantly, planning for the development of the conflict areas by state authorities is also in disarray.

Oti Region is a new region that needs to be developed, and conflicts can mar all the efforts.

Therefore, all factions there must heed the advice to seek peace for that purpose so that people living there, for that matter, all Ghanaians, would find joy in the land of their birth.",,Editorial, 13 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Oti-people-must-heed-peace-admonition-1921394
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Treat passage of Human Organ and Tissue Bill with urgency!!,"Many people consider the eyes to be the most important of the human senses because they provide vision, which is the ability to see.

Even though some blind people have become renowned achievers, blindness in many people has devastated their lives because it has inhibited the use of their potential in many areas of life.

This is why it is sad to hear that about 26,000 Ghanaians in need of cornea transplants risk losing their vision due to the absence of a law to support the harvesting of tissues locally.

The eye is made up of many parts, including the iris, pupils, lens, macula, choroid, optic nerve, cornea, and sclera, which work to complement each other.

What that means is that a defect or disease affecting any of the parts of the eye does not augur well for good vision.

The importance of the eyes makes it imperative that eye health be prioritised by every country.

In view of this, one wonders why eye health experts in the country are now bemoaning the absence of a law to back the local harvesting of tissues like the cornea, knowing very well that such a law has been in place elsewhere for years.

It is on record that corneal transplantation started in the late 1800s, with the first eye bank established nearly 90 years ago and the procedure having been done routinely since the 1960s.

It is said that at present, there are more than 44,000 corneal transplants done globally every year.

This means if getting the tissues for the procedure needs legislation, then the bottom line is that those providing the tissues have already sought that legislation.

Is it now that corneal transplantation has become an issue in eye care in the country, such that it was only last year that the Human Organ and Tissue Bill was drafted to seek legal backing for organ and tissue donation as well as transplantation in the country?

The bill seeks, among other things, to not only create a national authority to oversee and regulate organ or tissue donation and transplantation but also to protect the rights and interests of donors, recipients, and their families while ensuring ethical and legal standards around such procedures to meet the growing demand in the country.

The purpose of the bill, when passed into law, is enormous, which demands that lawmakers treat its passage with urgency.

Imagine, for instance, that when the Human Organ and Tissue Bill becomes law, it will help establish eye banks and provide fair and much-needed transplantation services to help restore sight to thousands in the country.

Corneal surgeons in the country cannot perpetually be dependent on sourcing tissues from abroad, which is both costly and time-consuming.

The world has come to a point where almost every endeavour needs legal backing; otherwise, even things done with good intentions can end up in all manner of disputes and battles.

Think about it: for the most part, corneal donation comes from people who are dead, and it is in very rare circumstances that a donor may be living.",,Editorial, 12 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Treat-passage-of-Human-Organ-and-Tissue-Bill-with-urgency-1921225
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Welcome to 13th African Games,"The 13th African Games, dubbed African Games Accra 2023, opened in Accra on Friday.

Running from March 8 to March 23, the sporting event, formerly called the All African Games, is gathering over 4,000 athletes from across the continent to compete in various sports disciplines in two cities: Accra and Cape Coast.

The three-week event, being organised in association with the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa and the Association of Africa Sports Confederations, also doubles as a qualifier for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

It is instructive to note that the Games are held every four years and a year before the Olympics.

We welcome the athletes and officials to the country, and we know all of them will experience the proverbial Ghanaian hospitality.

To that end, we appeal to all those who will happen to serve the visitors and even local athletes and officials, as well as fans, to be the Ghanaians that the whole world expects to see.

Originally scheduled to take place in August 2023, the Games were postponed to March 2024 but had to maintain their name, hence African Games 2023.

One of the reasons for the delay was that Ghana had difficulties completing the required facilities.

Now that the Games are running, it is obvious that the country has done its best in the provision of those facilities.

We are happy that because of the Games, the country can now boast about some sporting facilities, including the $145 million (132.5 million) sports complex at Borteyman and the University of Ghana stadium, which had been under construction for two decades.

We are happier when it is touted that some of the facilities provided are world-class.

We are only sad that most of the continents popular athletes will not feature in the Games because the delayed Games are now taking place so close to the Paris Olympics in July, and those athletes want to prepare for Paris 2024.

Even though their absence can take some shine from the Games, we believe it would give some young and unknown athletes the opportunity to showcase their talents and consequently earn a place on the global sporting platform.

We, therefore, encourage all the participants in the Games to prove their mettle, and even those who do not win medals should count it as an opportunity to spur them on to prepare more for the years ahead, bearing in mind that their time will surely come one day.

Apart from the benefits the host country and the athletes and officials would gain from the Games, we think the pan-African nature of the event itself has a message for African countries.

In the world today, the best message is the one that emphasizes unity, peace, and teamwork, or togetherness.

Africans must not come together only for sporting activities but on every field that can bring the continent togetherness, peace, prosperity, and progress.

Africa must leverage that spirit behind the power that brings its people of diverse cultures and backgrounds together to compete in sports to, for instance, improve its political leadership in particular to improve the lot of the people.

We wish the visitors to the country a happy stay and pray for an unprecedentedly successful African Games in 2023.",,Editorial, 11 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Welcome-to-13th-African-Games-1921034
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Happy International Womens Day,"Today is International Womens Day (IWD).

Congratulations to all women across the globe.

The day started to be observed in the early 1990s on different dates in various countries until 1975, when the United Nations began celebrating it on March 8.

The day has resulted from womens agitations for fair treatment and a better life wherever they are.

The records have it, for instance, that mens oppression and inequality spurred women in the US and Europe to become more vocal and active in campaigning for change.

No wonder the date for marking IWD has its root in the arrest on March 8, 1914, of Sylvia Pankhurst while on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square in London at one of the rallies organised by women across Europe to campaign against the First World War and to express womens solidarity in all the things they were fighting for across the globe.

On the occasion of celebrating women today, we pay tribute to the women who played front-line roles in fighting for a better life for women, such as Clara Zetkin, leader of the Womens Office for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, who, in addition to other roles, tabled the idea of an IWD.

The history of IWD must be read or studied by all people who are interested in the progress of women.

Today, women are calling for a better life for themselves and, in addition, for their children.

It is sad that societies across the globe are still male-dominated in everything except population numbers.

Chauvinism has become the bane of female progress in contemporary societies, a situation that does not augur well for the progress of society.

But for women and their physiology, the human race would have ceased to exist, and that role alone should be a good basis for pampering women in some way.

Women leading good lives in terms of having attained an acceptable education and enjoying some good socioeconomic status most often keep good families.

That is to say, if women were helped to overcome their present precarious situations, society would be full of people prepared enough to see to its progress.

This is why we agree with the United Nations (UN) on its theme for celebrating IWD 2024: Invest in women: Accelerate progress.

Even though women face a variety of problems, those in developed countries have better lives than those in poor or developing countries like Ghana.

We, therefore, wish the UNs theme for IWD this year would appeal more to governments in developing countries to help improve womens lives.

A good life for women means a good life for children, and the cycle continues, with the result being a prosperous nation.

We encourage women in privileged positions everywhere to highlight womens needs, particularly those of the underprivileged, and agitate about them until governments meet them.

We know some of the needs could be country-specific, and so we encourage privileged Ghanaian women, for example, to play their roles effectively, such as fighting for the Affirmative Action Bill to be passed into law.

Once again, congratulations to women for celebrating IWD today.",,Editorial,  8 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Happy-International-Women-s-Day-1920650
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ponder over significance of independence,"Yesterday, Ghanaians marked the 67th anniversary of their countrys independence from the British colonial masters.

The Ghanaian Times congratulates Ghana on succeeding in wresting independence from the British.

The commemoration of March 6, 1957, came with a variety of events or activities at the national, regional, district, and community levels.

Some members of the public also celebrated the day with some group and even individual or personal activities.

All such events or activities generally depict just the euphoria associated with the day Ghana gained its independence.

We think celebrating the day that way is only ritualistic if both the countrys native managers and the people fail to reflect on the true nature of independence vis-a-vis their responsibilities and rights in moving the country forward.

Thus, we wish to remind ourselves of some things Ghanaians should consider any time they commemorate the countrys independence.

It is common knowledge that Ghana being independent means no foreign power maintains any control over the political or civil processes of its government and people.

That is to say, its sovereignty, which is the right of the country to chart its own future through self-determination, is assured.

However, this sovereignty can remain intact when the country achieves economic freedom, maintains a robust judicial system, upholds an education system, develops the ability of individuals to make critical decisions that enhance the progress of their total lives, and focuses attention on the social mechanisms of the lives of the people, which include cultural values and community safety.

In a multi-cultural country like Ghana, the state must take note of which social acts are acceptable in one cultural environment and not in another and see how that will not undermine the peace of the whole country.

The state must also have respect for the environment, in which case it controls activities that cause pollution, global warming, ocean acidification, ozone layer depletion, and loss of biodiversity, as well as undermine public health.

We agree that independence notwithstanding, we live in a global village, where diplomatic pressures and bilateral cooperation are critical for the countrys advancement in a way, yet we need to prevent injurious external influence.

However, Ghana usually succumbs to external pressures that injure its cultural values and economic aspirations, all because of a lack of the financial muscle to develop the country, which consequently calls for dependence on external assistance that comes with its own conditions.

Imagine that the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is largely dependent on investment by foreign companies.

Meanwhile, the country is endowed with the natural resources that can give it the economic must but for mismanagement by its leadership, corruption, injustice, and the poor working attitude of the people.

It is also the case that the people do not demand accountability from their leaders at all levels, and politicians in particular are taking advantage of the situation to feed their personal interests through corruption and any other bad means.

Until the problems are fixed for the country to see progress, the annual commemoration of its independence is a fruitless venture that profits only the organisers of the celebrations.",,Editorial,  7 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ponder-over-significance-of-independence-1920471
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: We need to pass the LGBTQ test,"One issue that is causing debates and almost dividing the world is sexual orientation, which is about who is attracted to whom and wants to have relationships with.

Thus, we now have LGBTQ, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (or sometimes LGBTQ+, in which case the plus represents other sexual identities).

Since this sexual orientation became prominent in the 1990s, western countries have supported it as a human rights issue, whereas conservatives like Arabs, Chinese, and Africans see it as unnatural and against their cultural values.

Thus, some countries have attempted to enact laws against it.

In spite of their own acceptance and introduction of democracy, which calls for respect for the sovereignty of nations, western countries and their institutions do not seem to accept views and acts against LGBTQ+.

They are trying to impose it on poor nations, especially because of the financial assistance they give these nations.

On February 28, 2024, the countrys Parliament passed the Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values (Anti-LGBTQ) Bill, which is awaiting the assent of the President of the country, currently Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

Even before the President would assent to it, there is information that Ghana risks losing a total of $3.8 billion in the next five to six years from its development partners following the passage of the anti-LGBTQ law.

For example, in 2024, Ghana will lose $600 million in budget support and $250 million in the Financial Stability Fund. (See our story on page 9). The Ministry of Finance says this will negatively impact the countrys foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate stability, as these inflows are expected to shore up the countrys reserve position.

Much as we agree that Western financial assistance is critical to the socio-economic development of the country, we think the West and its institutions should acknowledge the cultural values of Ghanaians and assist them based on conditionalities that do not injure their values.

We think the tabling of legal issues against the LGBTQ+ law is appropriate, but not the withdrawal of the law because it represents the stance of the generality of Ghanaians on unnatural sexual orientation.

However, if the West insists on what they want to do, then we support the measures the Ministry of Finance wants the government to adopt to counter the situation, including engagement with conservative countries, including the Arab nations and China, to help trigger resources to fill in the potential financing gaps to be created through the withdrawal of financial support from the countrys development partners.

We also agree that the government should begin a structured engagement with local conservative forces such as religious bodies and faith-based organisations to communicate the economic implications of the passage of the Anti LGBTQ law and build a stronger coalition and a framework for supporting key development initiatives that are likely to be affected.

We sometimes hear that the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has exceeded its target.

Now is the real test moment for the GRA to prove its mettle in helping to fill the anticipated financial gaps.

It is also a test moment for the country to tell the world that it is possible for other countries to wean themselves off the assistance that comes with Western imposition.",,Editorial,  5 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-We-need-to-pass-the-LGBTQ-test-1920132
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: All must be involved in securing Ghana,"As part of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) he delivered in Parliament in Accra on Tuesday, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo cautioned that the country can no longer take its territorial integrity for granted in the face of attacks from extremist groups operating in the sub-region.

He elaborated on how the state had equipped the security services or forces to make them ready to defend the country in case of any eventuality.

Matters of security call for the attention and action of everyone in the country, not just members of the security services, even though they would be on the frontlines just in case.

This is why we find it very crucial that Ghana has adopted the July 2010 U.S. Department of Homeland Security campaign If You See Something, Say Something to raise public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime, as well as the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper state and local authorities.

As elsewhere, the campaign in Ghana is meant to make all citizens watchdogs for their neighbourhoods, looking out for characters whose identity, movement, and presence raise questions.

Currently, we see the campaign concentrated in the border communities as they become easier to access for infiltrators, especially given the fact that there are some unmonitored border crossing paths used to leave or enter the country.

For example, it is on record that there used to be 189 unmonitored border crossing paths with Burkina Faso alone, and this is a country where extremists are wreaking havoc that does not bode well for Ghana.

The government can talk about all the things it is doing to enhance security, yet it cannot ignore the involvement of the citizenry in securing peace and tranquility in the country.

It has universally been acknowledged that the highest level of modern-day security is to involve the citizens, because any success regarding security cannot be achieved only on the battlefield.

At least, intelligence from the citizens is crucial.

To this end, and because some terrorist elements can find ways and means to infiltrate the country, we wish the Ministry of National Security would emphasise the importance of the campaign in other communities.

We are happy that President Akufo-Addo did not ignore internal security issues, particularly regarding land and chieftaincy disputes, citing the Bawku conflict as a classical example.

It is sad that, despite all the efforts put in to contain these conflicts, some elements profiting from them continue to fan them.

We all seek reconciliation in such disputes, but it is about time the state contained them by any means possible to save the country's lives and financial and material resources lost to them.

Regarding internal security, we appeal to the police to especially track and arrest robbers, fraudsters, and other criminal elements who give people sleepless nights.

The sound security of the country is needed for everyone in the country to go about his or her activities without any threat whatsoever.

Therefore, the whole country must be sensitised to the importance of everyones involvement to secure the country against external aggression and internal disturbances.",,Editorial,  1 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-All-must-be-involved-in-securing-Ghana-1919518
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Bring February 28, 1948 lessons to bear on current governance!!","February 28 has become a very important day in the political history of Ghana since 1948.

 On this day, 76 years ago, British colonial police opened fire on ex-servicemen, specifically World War II veterans, who had organised a peaceful march to present a petition to the then British Governor at Osu Castle, Gerald Creasy, to demand unpaid gratuity or allowances from the British government.

 What has now come to be known as the 28 February Christianborg Crossroads shooting incident led to the killing of Sergeant Adjetey, Corporal Attipoe, and Private Odartey Lamptey.

 Every year, the state holds a special ceremony at the Freedom Monument, the location of the shooting incident, near the Black Star Square at Osu, in Accra, in memory of the three Ghanaian World War II veterans and, by extension, to honour all the war veterans.

 We would continue to encourage the commemoration of that incident even when all the war veterans leave for eternity.

 We, however, think such an anniversary will be only ritualistic if it is marked with parades, wreath-laying, and speeches.

 We need to immortalise the incident by learning from it, especially with regard to the events that led to it and those that followed it.

 The incident significantly contributed to the attainment of the countrys political independence.

 Today, the British have been gone for 67 years this March. Can the countrys leaders claim they have prevented the similitude of what led to the veterans protest, which the British interpreted as a riot and, as such, attempted to quell it with the fatal shooting?

 Arent our present-day native politicians and other public officials withholding all manner of payments to some people and even calling their bluff in addition?

 May yesterdays commemoration of the Christianborg Crossroads shooting remind these state officials that one day the victims of their insensitive acts can cause uproars that will be supported by the whole nation.

 In the face of all the hardships in the country now, which duty-bearers must address, they sometimes paint a picture that all is rosy.

 We can see that there is pent-up anger among the masses, which can explode into an uncontrollable action if only public officials, especially, continue to flourish while the majority of the people languish in squalor.

 Listen to public reactions to provocative remarks made by some swollen-headed politicians, and no one should tell you politicians and their cohorts can no longer treat the people as being gullible and take them for a ride.

 It will be recalled that shortly after days of disturbances across the country following the February 28, 1948 incident, the leadership of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), a political party, sent a cable to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London warning that the situation would get out of control if the colonial government was not changed for an independent one.

 Has independence brought to the country equality, justice, accountability, and other such values or virtues that the incident became a catalyst for?

 The Ghanaian Times believes that the commemoration of the 1948 shooting incident is unproductive if its lessons are not brought to bear on the current governance of the country.",,Editorial, 29 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Bring-February-28-1948-lessons-to-bear-on-current-governance-1919330
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Jospong Group deserves every support,"The Lagos State Government in Nigeria has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Ghanas Jospong Group of Companies to provide solutions to the recycling, treatment, and processing of waste in the state.

In a speech after signing the MoU on behalf of Lagos State, Mr. Tukunbo Wahab, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, justified the choice of the Ghanaian group to provide service in Nigeria.

He said, among other things, that the public-private partnership (PPP) with Jospong was clinched because Jospong is the best company in Africa that could offer the needed services to address the states hydra-headed waste challenges.

The Commissioner added that Jospong can turn Nigerias waste into valuable resources or wealth.

We are excited about the eulogy from Mr. Wahab, a foreigner, as that goes to prove that Jospong Group is being watched outside the country and that the quality of its services in waste management is not in doubt.

No wonder one of its subsidiaries, Zoomlion, already provides similar services in other African countries, such as Togo, Angola, Zambia, Equatorial Guinea, and Liberia.

In fact, the Jospong Group has carved a niche for itself as a reliable solution to the increasing waste management problems in Africa.

The Group, which started as a printing press in 1995 and now has some 60 subsidiaries and has shown business interest in over 14 sectors, has a company in Asia too.

Some of its business areas are banking and insurance, aluminum processing, plastic waste recycling, jute production, oil and gas, ICT, manufacturing, building and construction, automobiles and equipment, ports and logistics services, mining and quarrying, logistics, and agriculture.

At a time and in a country where some businesses are not able to overcome their nascent problems and, as a result, die prematurely, the Jospong keeps flourishing.

This means the group is doing something right that other businesses, particularly the failing ones, should know and adopt.

Even though we cannot actually point to the secrets behind Jospongs phenomenal success, we can say that its Executive Chairman, Dr. Joseph Siaw Agyepong, values godliness in his dealings.

It is, therefore, not surprising that godliness opens the couching of its core values, which read: Godliness & Fellowship, Service Excellence, Stewardship, People-Focused, Teamwork..

Public utterances that emanate from the group clearly point to the fact that it is not relenting in its daily efforts to be the best in its chosen areas.

This gives hope that it will lead to addressing current challenges and those that will arise over time. We are solidly behind Jospong Group because its good work outside Ghana is a demonstration of selling the country, which boosts its goodwill in the global space.

Besides, though its services abroad create jobs in the host countries, some of these services are also rendered by Ghanaians posted there.

Obviously, these add up to jobs created for Ghanaians at home. We are also aware of the huge taxes it pays to the state, as well as the foreign exchange repatriations it brings home, all in the bid to improve the countrys gross domestic product.

The Jospong Group of Companies therefore deserves every support the state of Ghana can give it to continue to flourish.",,Editorial, 28 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Jospong-Group-deserves-every-support-1919150
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Including Free SHS policy in manifestos apt,"The pre-tertiary education teacher unions in the country have called on political parties to include in their manifestos for the general election 2024 a review of the Free Senior High School/Technical, Vocational, and Training (SHS/TVET) programme.

The call needs the support of all.

Usually, political parties put together manifestos for elections and these include whatever they intend to implement to better the lot of the people.

Oftentimes, however good some policies or programmes are, they are abandoned when there is a change of government.

In the face of that, we can interpret the call by the teacher unions as one seeking continuity for a policy that is for the national good no matter which party birthed it.

In September 2017, the Akufo-Addo administration started the implementation of the Free Senior High School (Free SHS) programme, which had been its manifesto promise.

This was a promise that was criticized by opponents of Akufo-Addo from the day he mentioned it and the criticism has persisted even during its implementation.

Now there are calls for its review for various reasons, including lack of funding, lack of infrastructure because the policy has increased secondary school enrolment, and lack of adequate human resources to handle it.

Even some critics say the wholesale implementation of the policy was rushed and that they would have preferred a progressive implementation in which case they would have done things bit by bit.

At one point, even some critics called for its scrapping.

In the face of the hullabaloo, we guess the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), the National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT), and the Coalition of Concerned Teachers, Ghana (CCT-GH) are entertaining fears that the Free SHS policy can suffer a wreck, hence their call.

Their idea behind the call was that the policy must be depoliticised and made a national initiative that would be implemented within the parameters of Article 25(1) (b) of the 1992 constitution and supervised by the Ghana Education Service rather than the Free SHS Secretariat is very good.

This is because in that case, the policy now ceases to be one mans initiative that can be ignored by his opponents.

According to Article 25 1b of the 1992 Constitution, secondary education in its different forms, including technical and vocational education, shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means.

Also, Goal 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) expects that by 2030, nations should ensure that all girls and boys complete free equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

The implementation of the Free SHS programme in the country therefore serves a purpose that even has global acceptance and encouragement.

It has provided hope to children who otherwise could not have attained secondary or high school education mostly due to cost barriers.

Secondary education prepares learners for higher education or the workforce having developed their intellectual, social, and emotional skills and positioned them for critical thinking, creativity, and independence.

Thus, we support the call for political parties to pay significant attention to the Free SHS programme for it is a tool for national development.",,Editorial, 27 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Including-Free-SHS-policy-in-manifestos-apt-1918980
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Highlight morality to ensure public good,"A call from President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to the African Christian Movement not to only focus on the spiritual growth of the people, but also their socioeconomic development is in order.

We must admit that some Christian denominations and assemblies or congregations are already undertaking ventures geared toward the socio-economic development of their members and in some cases the larger society.

We can think of Christian denominations like the Presbyterian, Methodist, and Pentecost building schools and hospitals for the use of every citizen irrespective of religious affiliations.

Then there are welfare, cooperative, and other schemes to support the well-being of congregational members.

The contribution of the general Christian community to the development of the people, for that matter the country, is not in dispute.

If that is the case, then why the call from the President?

The Presidents call is important because it comes as a kind of reminder that the Christian community has to do more to help the people in the face of changing circumstances.

Today, poverty levels are rising, there are climate change problems, which are global, and there are local or national problems like galamsey and associated ills, teenage pregnancy, and rising unemployment among the youth.

Normally, everyone would think that it is the responsibility of the state to solve these problems but common knowledge is clear that the state alone cannot do so.

It is also clear that some of the people lack the understanding and implications of these problems and all they can do is treat them as spiritual.

Therefore, we agree that there is a need for the Christian community to work closely together with the state in tackling the problems that confront the citizenry.

The Church must have constant interactions with the state, ascertain programmes and projects being undertaken to address these problems and see where it can come in to improve the situation.

For instance, the Church must get a clear understanding of the problems and make them subjects of sermons or homilies in the bid to get members to understand and accept the realities of life.

Also, it must enhance its welfare schemes to help needy members undertake ventures that can bring them out of hardships.

In fact, one thing that is undermining the development of the country is the lack of morality among the generality of the people, which shows itself in all manner of dishonest acts like corruption, bribery, cheating, shoddy work, and overpricing.

When quantified in monetary terms, these ills cost many people and the country fortunes that benefit a few people, particularly politicians and those in privileged positions of rendering services to the people.

It can only take the Church to highlight these ills and admonish the people to avoid them for the good of the people.

If truly, Ghanas population is at least 70 percent Christian, and corruption and all manner of evils are commonplace, then the Church has failed in its duty to help build the nation.

It can only take the same Church to reverse the trend and this is a very important role it can play in ensuring the development and progress of the people.",,Editorial, 26 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Highlight-morality-to-ensure-public-good-1918790
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Save CSIR land from encroachers!,"Yesterday, the National Executives of Star Associations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) had a press conference to appeal to the government to help it retrieve its land in the Pokuase/Amasaman area that is being taken over by developers, including the government itself.

A statement read to the media evokes emotions as it narrates the involvement of the government in taking over parts of the over 400 acres of land.

Even though at a point the Council kowtowed to the pressure of the government in taking part of the land for an affordable housing project, what is worrying is that the process was deprived of honesty and transparency.

The situation has now come to a point where private developers are taking over the whole land much to the disregard of the terms of the initial agreement.

If the CSIR presser is anything to go by, then the President of the Republic of Ghana must step in to cause the arrest of developers using his name to appropriate the land for their benefits. What is more worrying is that over 400 acres of the land are being cleared and in the process destroying ongoing scientific experiments, as well as valuable CSIR research materials that have taken decades to develop on experimental field plots.

The CSIR was established by NLC Decree 293 of October 10, 1968, amended by NLCD 329 of 1969, and re-established in its present form by CSIR Act 521 on November 26, 1996.

Since its establishment, CSIR has been at the forefront of the development of various crop varieties, conservation of Ghanas indigenous genetic resources, soil classification and conservation practices, food processing and preservation, forest and water resources management; building and road technology: agriculture, aquaculture, and food security.

This shows how important the Council is and its various activities call for the use of land and structures at various places in the country.

For instance, by Executive Instrument 38 (E.I. 38), the government in 1976 established the CSIR-Animal Research Institute (ARI) on land measuring over 1,000 acres at Adentan-Frafraha, and given the mandate to conduct research into the development and transfer of livestock and poultry technologies to communities, farmer groups, private and public organisations.

The sad thing is that CSIR has to contend with encroachers so the Pokuase/ Amasaman case is just fresh but not strange.

For example, on June 21, 2022, encroachers on lands belonging to the CSIR-ARI at Adentan were given a 48-hour notice to move out of the area or face ejection by the Greater Accra Regional Security Council (REGSEC), in collaboration with the Adentan Municipal Assembly and the CSIR.

We remember the appeal made on May 16, 2022, by Professor Paul Bosu, the then newly-inducted Director-General of the CSIR, to the Government and other stakeholders to help protect the Councils lands from encroachment.

We think encroachers on CSIR lands either do not know the importance of the Council or are just acting lawlessly.

We want to join any such appeal from the CSIR to protect its lands and hope the government, which is the last resort in matters of national interest, would help rather than being complicit in the CSIR land encroachment matter.",,Editorial, 23 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Save-CSIR-land-from-encroachers-1918425
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: MASLOC must reassess performance!!,"The Microfinance and Small Loans Centre (MASLOC) was established in 2006, to provide microcredit and small loans to start-ups and small businesses with fast, easy accessibility to grow and expand their businesses.

The idea behind the establishment of the centre is to reach out to as many clients as possible, especially those in the informal sector who are excluded from mainstream banking and are unable to access loans and credit from the formal banking sector.

Everyone thought beneficiaries would be guided by this noble objective, especially receiving loans at an interest rate of 12 percent per annum, the lowest in the country, and paying back the loans so that others could be reached.

It is, therefore, worrying that MASLOC is struggling to recover loans amounting to GH291,545,925 disbursed since 2008.

What accounts for the recalcitrance of the beneficiaries to repay the loans?

The rumour is that some beneficiaries think MASLOC loans are an opportunity for them to get their share of the national cake.

After all, they do not see any serious action taken against defaulters over the years except a few court prosecutions whose conclusions are hardly made public.

Even though some district and regional managers and their teams go after defaulters, sometimes calling some of them before chiefs, family heads, and other community leaders to warn them, we think they treat them softly, which is one of the reasons for the recalcitrance to repay the loans.

If the repayment period is 12 months but managers start chasing defaulters sometimes after two years, who would care to attach urgency and seriousness to the repayment?

Meanwhile, MASLOC workers continue to draw their salaries, which in itself gives them the tacit encouragement to relax or even renege on their duties.

It is about time the payment of MASLOC workers salaries is related to loan retrieval and profit made.

The way out is that the workers should get more serious, particularly the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the managers at all levels.

They should avoid the flimsy and disheartening excuses they give for their decimal or mediocre performance.

We, thus, applaud Dr. James Klutse Avedzi, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, for not mincing words in telling the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MASLOC, Paul Sarbeng, when he appeared before PAC in Accra yesterday that the performance of MASLOC was mediocre.

Why should Mr. Sarbeng even get the guts to tell PAC and, for that matter, the public that the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted negatively on businesses, hence their inability to pay back loans?

Can a pandemic breaking out in the country in 2020 be a good basis for not collecting loans outstanding since 2008?

The truth is simply that MASLOC is doing badly and must reassess itself and save its imminent collapse.

Listen to Dr. Avedzi talk to MASLOC through Mr. Sarbeng: You have collected only about four percent of the total amount (that is, outstanding loans since 2008) and that cannot be a job well done. This shows that MASLOC is not doing close to the recovery rate you told us. It is also a clear example that MASLOC is in trouble and you have no funds to operate or meet your mandate.",,Editorial, 22 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-MASLOC-must-reassess-performance-1918243
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Resolve challenges reducing cocoa tonnage!,"There is a saying that Ghana is cocoa, cocoa is Ghana.

To the Ghanaian, cocoa is more than a simple crop because apart from its economic value, it forms part of the national identity and the countrys social history.

Therefore, any circumstance that negatively affects cocoa growth and production must be dealt with head-on, and those coming in as support encouraged with all strength.

This is why the Ghanaian Times is worried about the news that Ghana lost 150,000 tonnes of cocoa beans last year due to the activities of smugglers.

Besides smuggling, due to the lowest price of the commodity in cocoa-producing countries, there are other challenges like the outbreak of El Nino disease; destruction of cocoa farms by perpetrators of galamsey; disinterest of young people in cultivating cocoa, leaving the average age of cocoa farmers at 55 years; and the cheating by cocoa-purchasing clerks.

Luckily, all these problems are bare to the authorities and so all one expects is the move to resolve them and such a move must enjoy all seriousness.

We are happy to hear, for instance, that the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) has established a task force, including personnel of the National Security, to undertake regular operations to arrest the perpetrators of cocoa smuggling and retrieve the product.

We support this initiative and hope since smuggling is a crime, the perpetrators will be prosecuted in addition.

However, if we want to be fair, the whole nation must interrogate why the COCOBOD has not been able to resolve the producer price variations in which case the price is significantly low in Ghana and thus, motivates the continuous smuggling of cocoa to neighbouring countries.

Besides, why has Ghana persisted in forward sales of cocoa which allows the Board to sell off 60 to 65 percent of cocoa produce as syndication at a significantly lower price before it is harvested?

Is it because of the syndicated loans the country yearly contracts to buy cocoa?

Some of us think it is about time the country weaned itself of that practice which lends itself to various interpretations.

Can the COCOBOD emulate the example of La Cote dIvoire, in which case it will sell on the spot, a situation that gives farmers the opportunity to demand higher sales for their produce?

We have no qualms about Ghana having developed a new producer price which will be implemented in the new crop season to guarantee higher prices for cocoa beans.

However, the question is, will the new price be enough to discourage the urge to smuggle the produce?

We believe all the challenges causing the dwindling tonnage of cocoa produced in the country can be dealt with and they should be.

We are happy with the gains the country has made in the gold sector, for example, but sad that the mineral has replaced cocoa as the leading foreign exchange earner.

We think, considering the larger national good, the cocoa industry must be boosted above gold because it employs more citizens as it serves as a major source of living for most people in Ghana, particularly in the rural areas.",,Editorial, 21 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Resolve-challenges-reducing-cocoa-tonnage-1918069
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Changing general election date effective 2028 appropriate,"General election dates are crucial in all democracies because of the anticipation of run-off elections and the day of the coronation of the president-elect.

In Ghana, December 7 is the general election date and the president-elect is inaugurated on January 7, indicating a space of just a month.

Even though with the exception of 2008 when the country has not had presidential run-offs, that years experience alone was enough to broach a debate on the change of the date for the four-year general election in the country.

Therefore, it came as good news when the EC accepted the proposal of political parties for the change of the date and thus presented at the Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) meeting held on January 22, 2024, two intertwined proposals regarding the matter.

The first was that the December 7 date which has been used as the day for both Presidential and Parliamentary elections since 1992 be changed to a date in November.

According to the EC, the change will allow sufficient time for it to effectively manage its operations, particularly in the event of a run-off.

The EC also wants the general election date to be designated as a national holiday to boost public participation in the electoral process.

Before the EC proposal, the Seventh-Day Adventist Church by a petition to the EC, had requested that this years election date be changed because falling on a Saturday will conflict with what they describe as the Sabbath, a holy day they have dedicated worship to God.

The EC promised that there would be further discussion of the whole matter for the political parties, and the principal stakeholders to come to a consensus.

However, before this could happen, the EC has stated that its proposal to move the date for the countrys general elections from December 7 to a date in November will not take effect this year but in 2028 because the legislation required for the change is yet to be put before Parliament.

We think the EC has been proactive enough because its move can nip in the bud and certain negative views that could have been attributed to the change if it had been rushed this year.

It is not in doubt that all the political parties in the country and the general public accept the change but no one could have prevented the negative questions and comments.

Elections are crucial in all democracies and are a life-or-death matter for some of the people, particularly in Africa.

Some of the electoral conflicts that have taken place have been a result of bad comments passed about elections.

Ghana is touted as a peaceful country in a continent suffering political upheavals now and then and that status must be acknowledged always and upheld.

To avoid any conflict with the changed date, we wish to agree that it should not be a particular date but any day from Monday to Thursday in November or any other appropriate month, to save a debate related to Muslim worship on Friday.

Holidays have cost implications for employers, so the proposal to declare general election days as national holidays, despite the good it is intended for needs further deliberations.",,Editorial, 20 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Changing-general-election-date-effective-2028-appropriate-1917869
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Make meter acquisition non-frustrating!,"The discovery by the Northern Electricity Distribution Company (NEDCo) of more than 3000 illegal meters being used in Sunyani in the Bono Region is no news, so to speak.

There are countless media reports on the use of illegal meters for both electricity and water, some of which are even prosecuted yet the problem persists.

This means there is a fundamental problem that must be addressed and that problem is the process of acquiring the meter.

The challenges inherent in the process must be blamed on the utility providers, not forgetting that getting a meter from the Ghana Water Company is also bedevilled with the same bureaucratic and chaotic process.

It is unfortunate that officials of these companies would readily deny any knowledge of how some people, including their own workers, are exploiting the bureaucratic nature of the meter acquisition process to do their own thing.

Most of the time, it is desperation or frustration that makes the customer agree to the assistance of a middleman or a third party in the acquisition of the meter for the use of electricity or water.

Why should people suffer to acquire whatever meters in the first place?

We believe it should be the joy of utility providers that their customers want to be metered because they would enjoy the benefits more than the customers.

Because they can resort to law to take their customers to task, the utility companies are sleeping and NEDCo is no exception.

Do they need only tip-offs to go to town?

We cannot accept that they have made it as part of their fieldwork to regularly ascertain the integrity of meters otherwise it should not take long to uncover the first few illegal meters and deal with them before the number can grow.

Whether it is the fault of the customer or not, the companies must not forget the dishonesty in the Ghanaian system and act based on suspicion regularly rather than in swoops or operations.

We think regular checks and strict application of the law are the only ways to put to rest the issue of illegal meters in the system.

If this cannot be done, then that can give the cause to the public to speculate and even allege.

We know that the utility companies lose revenue through the use of illegal meters but we want to be honest that they do not deserve anyones sympathy because they have created the situation for others to exploit to their advantage.

If it is non-payment of bills, we shall devote our pages to help educate the public and to name and shame defaulting customers but not when the case of ineptitude and negligence on the part of the companies is clear.

Henceforth, let NEDCo be proactive by attaching urgency to meter acquisition and the circumstances shall change for the better.

Let other utility service providers also heed this advice and it is likely the problem of illegal meters shall be killed, thereby discouraging people from doing unauthorised importation of meters, which helps in perpetrating the provision and use of illegal meters in the country.",,Editorial, 19 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Make-meter-acquisition-non-frustrating-1917681
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Probe shoddy work under 1V1D initiative,"Agriculture in Ghana is mainly rain-fed and availability of water all year round is a problem.

The problem is worse in the northern part of the country where rainfall is generally scanty.

It was in the face of this problem that President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in 2017, started fulfilling his campaign promise of providing one dam in every village or community in the five northern regions of the country.

The Water Resource Commission (WRC) is in the news as saying that at least three dams constructed under the One-Village- One-Dam (1V1D) policy in the Upper East Region alone are unable to provide all-year-round water for both domestic and agricultural use due to shoddy works by the contractors.

The WRC says contractors who constructed the dams did not have the relevant skills and the government consulted private contractors rather than the Ghana Irrigation Authority.

The Commission said other challenges included inadequate knowledge of community members regarding the technicalities involved in the siting and construction of reservoirs and lack of data on the policy.

It is unfortunate that a system meant to facilitate dry-season farming and resolve challenges with the availability of water for domestic use has turned out to dash all hopes of the people who now see their problems rather compounded.

We are worried just as the people are because most of them are peasant farmers and animal keepers whose livelihoods are threatened in the dry season.

That threat has a number of implications that are everyones guess.

If what the WRC is saying is anything to go by, then it is legitimate to question the government regarding why the contract for the implementation of a critical policy like the 1V1D should be offered to contractors who are not experts in the construction of earth dams.

Was it a case of the government giving the job to the boys?

We have learnt that way back in 2019, it cost an average of GH250000 to construct one such dam, so it means that it is a great financial loss to the state if more dams cannot be put to use.

It was common knowledge that even some rivers and natural wells dried up during the dry season in the northern parts of the country and so the understanding was that the dams to be provided under the 1V1D arrangement were going to be ones that could withstand the odds of the dry season.

As things stand now, it is not surprising that the National President of the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, Mr Wepia Addo Awal Adugwada, says many stakeholders have lost hope in the government because its initiatives such as the 1V1D purposed to enhance the agriculture sector have failed to meet expectations of farmers.

We hope the government will institute a probe into the shoddiness of dams under the 1V1D initiative and offenders surcharged with the cost of repairs or the construction of new ones.

Then, as the WRC has proposed, project managers must consult relevant institutions like the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority to assist in the execution of the projects to promote efficiency.",,Editorial, 16 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Probe-shoddy-work-under-1V1D-initiative-1917302
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Change current hardship narrative,"The much-awaited ministerial reshuffle has finally taken place but some are of the view that it has happened too late.

Maybe those who think so have their mind on the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, who sacked all the 137 Members of Parliament from his own party, the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), demanded in early November 2022 for causing the countrys worst economic crisis in a generation.

As promised, it appears President Akufo-Addo is satisfied with the efforts of Ofori-Atta regarding the countrys bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Now, he has been replaced by Mohammed Amin Adam and it will be everyones hope that after Parliament has approved his appointment, he will work hard to bring a change that will reduce the hardship in the country now.

The public says his approval is a done deal so he should begin to consider what will constitute the magic wand he would use to change the situation to enhance the chances of his party breaking the eight.

Probably, some elements of the vision of Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the Vice President, and NPPs flagbearer, can be implemented now.

Will it be wrong to start abolishing E-Levy and other taxes that have become regressive now?

The Ministry of Finance is the oxygen of the countrys progress and so the buck stops at its door when the economy goes wrong.

That is not to say that other ministries are not as important.

The point is that the finance ministry must be effective in making sure all the other ministries and sectors under them have their budgets to prosecute their projects and programmes.

Some think the reshuffle will be of little effect coming less than 10 months to this years general election in which the ruling party, the New Patriotic Party, can be retained in power or voted out.

However, others think it can make some impact if the ministers reassigned or newly appointed consider the need to work ingenuously to meet whatever reason for which the President has given them their portfolios.

We want to go along with these people in the sense that even though the President did not give reason(s) for relieving some of his ministers of their posts completely, reassigning some, and bringing on new ones, we can conclude that he has done so as a strategy.

Remember that even some of the ministers dropped from public view are going to be working in the Presidency.

Ofori-Atta, for instance, is the minister of state at the finance ministry.

It is, therefore, our hope that the ministers reassigned, the new ones and those not touched would work hard enough to change the current negative narrative about the government.

They should try to make the good things the government has done become so glaring to the public now that the Akufo-Addo government is going to end its second term in months.

That legacy should be one in the public interest that even the opposition would want to continue should it win power.",,Editorial, 15 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Change-current-hardship-narrative-1917080
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: New assemblies should enhance development!,"Yesterday, 259 out of 261 Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) across the country were inaugurated after elections to those assemblies were held last December, following the expiration of their terms.

 Nkoranza North and Nkoransa South in the Bono East Region were not part of the inauguration because they had their elections in 2021 instead of 2019, in which case their terms would have expired in 2023.

 The District Level Elections have been held every four years since 1988 and take place a year before the Presidential and Parliamentary elections.

 The MMDAs have become sine qua non on the political landscape of the country because of their functions, which can be captured collectively as seeing to the overall socio-economic development of their jurisdictions.

 For instance, they formulate and execute plans, programs, and strategies for the effective mobilisation of resources necessary for the overall development of the district.

 In terms of politics, we can say the MMDAs, as well as their unit committee offshoots, are avenues to whip up the interest of people in politics as an indispensable part of the development of their local communities and the nation at large.

 They also ensure political inclusiveness in a way, which is why we were happy when the Minister of Local Government, Decentralisation, and Rural Development, Dan Botwe, told the media ahead of the inauguration that the government was determined to ensure that the majority of the 30 percent of government appointees to the MMDAs would be women and people living with disabilities (PWDs).

 We would be grateful if the government paid heed to this resolve otherwise the public must know why.

 Either these special people refused the appointments or the government gave an empty promise.

 As part of the inauguration, representatives of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo delivered his inaugural address.

 The President urged assembly members to acquaint themselves with all the relevant laws on local governance to avoid conflicts with key stakeholders in their localities, including the District Chief Executive, traditional authorities, religious leaders, and other key stakeholders in the localities.

 The essence of this is to build good working relationships with all the stakeholders to enhance cooperation between the stakeholders to drive development.

 We hope the assembly members and even unit committee members would heed the advice because oftentimes some assembly members become full of themselves and cause trouble.

 The districts need development, not strife that eventually undermines development.

 Some of the districts are highly under-developed and so we like to urge the assemble members to identify the loopholes that readily come to them and help plug them.

 Sometimes it is difficult to accept that the assemblies are living by their mandate.

 For instance, improper spatial planning is a huge problem that we expect the new assemblies to tackle to ensure the free movement of people and vehicles and environmental beauty.

 As we have already said, the MMDAs and their associated unit committees are training grounds for participation in politics in the country.

 We know some Members of Parliament (MPs) who were motivated by their being former assembly members.

 It is our hope that the new assemblies will bring significant change to bear on the development of their jurisdictions and the entire country.",,Editorial, 13 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-New-assemblies-should-enhance-development-1916693
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: All must work for peace in Nkwanta,"Ethnic or tribal conflicts are common in a few areas of the country.

One such conflict is the one between the Adele and Challa ethnic groups on one side and the Akyode on the other, who live at Nkwanta in the Oti Region.

Some media reports say the three tribes have been in contention for the ownership of the Nkwanta township for some decades now, a conflict yet to be resolved.

Thus, when in October 2023 the Akyodes wanted to perform some rituals to herald the celebration of their annual Kyodjible (Yam Festival), and the Adeles and Challas ethnic groups had a joint press conference against the celebration of the festival.

According to the two groups, the festival would lead to disturbance.

Eventually, there was a clash in which scores suffered gunshot wounds but with no life lost though, yet it forced thousands of residents to flee the Nkwanta township to elsewhere.

Consequently, the Minister for the Interior, on the advice of the Oti Regional Security Council and by an Executive Instrument, imposed a curfew on Nkwanta on November 21, 2023, from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

Since then, there have been reviews with the latest one taking effect from February 6, 2024.

Today, traders in the Nkwanta-South Municipality have appealed to the government to review the curfew from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m to 6:00 a.m.

Curfews mainly restrict movement within certain periods and thus affect socio-economic activities so it was not unexpected that the traders would ask for the review to enable them to improve on their business activities.

We think the traders have a point but they have to agree that their request can only be granted when there are all signs that peace has returned to the area and that the review cannot jeopardize the situation.

In fact, it is our wish that the current volatile situation did not erupt at all.

Therefore, as the government continues to appeal to chiefs, elders, opinion leaders, the youth, and the entire people of the area to exercise restraint and use non-violent means to resolve the matter, we urge the traders' association to also seek its own best way(s) to help ensure peace.

The truth is that it is not only the traders that need some relief but others also.

Think, for instance, about the farmer who would be on tenterhooks while on the farm because he does not know can be ahead of him after closing from a hard days labour.

What we are driving at is that the traders request is legitimate but critical to the current delicate situation.

Happily, the security services are on the ground and will certainly support even the lifting of the curfew at the right time.

It therefore behoves all stakeholders to see the need to bring peace and tranquility to Nkwanta and just work towards that.

Even if there are people who think they are benefitting from the unpeaceful situation, they should accept that their number is very small.

Thus, all of us must think of the safety, peace, and interests of the majority of the people.",,Editorial, 12 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-All-must-work-for-peace-in-Nkwanta-1916488
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Political Parties Act, 2000 truly needs amendment","Political parties are the backbone of democracy in any country because they contest elections to secure the mandate of the people to rule them.

Among the things they do in governance is to ensure accountability in which case they try to check corruption.

However, the situation seems to be different in Ghana due to some happenings involving the political parties in the country.

From the perspectives of the citizenry and some civil society organisations (CSOs), political parties and, for that matter, politicians in the country are heavily corrupt.

Their corrupt practices begin with the flouting of the very laws they are supposed to uphold and enforce.

Therefore, we support the advocacy by the Ghana Anti-Corruption Coalition (GACC), a CSO, for an amendment of the Political Parties Act, 2000 (Act 574) to include the disclosure of funding sources for presidential and parliamentary candidates.

Currently, the law mandates political parties to submit only their audited official financial accounts to the Electoral Commission (EC), which then makes it public.

However, it is the contention of the Coalition that such audited accounts do not reflect all the sources of their financial inflows, as actual campaign funds often bypass these official accounts as they are independently managed by the flagbearers and parliamentary candidates.

One may ask for evidence of this, but certain happenings give credence to that position.

For instance, there has been public outcry over millions of Ghana Cedis spent in presidential and parliamentary primaries of both the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), the two major political parties in the country.

Today, even some politicians continue to express concern over the canker of corruption perpetrated by political parties and politicians.

One such worried politicians is the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu.

The Member of Parliament for Suame in the Ashanti Region has asserted that the structure of internal elections in the various political parties encourages corruption.

The lawmaker says the practice where candidates dole out money to delegates who have constituted themselves into a cabal in the name of transport fares is dangerous and threatens the countrys democracy.

His statement that we all know we are sowing the seed of corruption at the base level of our parties. You reap what you sow is very instructive.

It is clear that the law is not strong and broad enough to deal with corrupt practices of political parties.

Usually, because of the power of the politician to do and undo, some people or organisations are afraid to point out their evil ways.

It is good that even fellow politicians have started talking about the corrupt practices of political parties and individual politicians, which makes it easier for others to join the conversation.

This conversation must be sustained until some change is achieved otherwise the countrys democracy is jeopardised.

Besides, the public purse would continue to suffer as politicians who pay huge sums to secure power would explore all diabolic means to recoup their money, usually through inflating the cost of public projects, diversion of public funds, and all manner of embezzlements.

We do not need only a broad-based law but also one enforced and deterrent enough to check corruption among political parties and politicians.

Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Make renewable energy cost-effective,"Ghana discovered significant oil reserves in 2007 and production started in December 2010.

Thus, it can be said that the country started accruing oil revenue in 2010.

There is a report that there are 12 priority areas in which oil revenue spending is done, including alternative energy.

This means a suggestion to invest part of the countrys oil revenue in renewable energy technologies like solar power is in order.

The idea is that the country can reduce its reliance on traditional fossil fuels, thereby contributing to both economic and environmental sustainability.

Renewable energy is natural and self-replenishing, and usually has a low zero-carbon footprint, includes wind power, solar power, bioenergy (organic matter burned as a fuel), and hydroelectric, for its nature of being harmless to human health and the environment.

Renewable energy is referred to as clean energy, whereas non-renewable sources such as oil, gas, coal, and firewood are referred to as dirty energy.

Dirty energy sources are only available in limited amounts as they come from sources that will run out or will not be replenished in our lifetimes.

It is recorded that non-renewable energy sources generally can endanger human health and the environment.

For example, oil drilling might require fracking, which is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas and this technology can cause earthquake and water pollution.

The worst of it all is that the whole process of generating and using dirty energy contributes to global warming.

Considering nature and how to make use of the two types of energy, the suggestion to invest in renewable energy comes in as one that must not be ignored.

Currently, Ghanas power mix includes thermal generation, accounting for the largest share of 66 percent, hydro accounting for 33 percent, and solar one percent.

Ghanas thermal power generation is fuelled largely by natural gas, but occasionally using light crude oil and diesel.

We believe the suggestion is given in the context of safeguarding human health, protecting the environment, and eventually making energy cheaper for people to use.

Currently, it is more expensive to produce renewable energy, which is why even the US, a rich country, for example, has less than 20 percent of its energy mix as renewable.

It is, thus, no wonder that the records indicate that over the past 500 years or so, humans have increasingly turned to cheaper, dirtier energy sources such as charcoal and firewood as is the case in Ghana.

However, new research shows that in the long run, renewable energy is more cost-effective than non-renewable energy.

It is said that wind and utility-scale solar eventually can be the least expensive energy-generating sources because there are now innovative and less-expensive ways to capture and retain wind and solar energy.

Against this background, we support every suggestion to the government to invest part of the countrys oil revenue in renewable energy sources like solar and make them cheaper for the people.

Besides, the country will be contributing to reducing climate change as the use of dirty energy will decrease.",,Editorial,  8 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Make-renewable-energy-cost-effective-1915851
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Uphold commitment to rent assistance scheme!,"It is unfortunate that successive governments have spoken volumes about providing housing and not just housing but also affordable one for the citizenry.

However, all of them have failed in this enterprise, leaving a housing deficit to grapple with.

But for the efforts of private house owners, Ghana would have suffered a huge housing deficit, one that would be greatly overwhelming.

While private house owners must be applauded for their efforts to lessen the stress related to securing accommodation, one huge problem with most of these owners is the huge rent advance they charge.

Some of them charge even three years advance when the countrys laws allow only six months advance as the highest amount to be charged, if the tenancy is longer than six months, otherwise two months rent in advance should charged.

However, the Rent Control Department says paying more than six months rent in advance does not result in any crime if the payment is a result of an agreement between the tenant and the house owner.

In fact, rent advance is a huge burden for most workers in the country, particularly the young ones.

Therefore, when the government launched the National Rental Assistance Scheme (NRAS) on January 31, 2023 in fulfillment of a campaign promise in the governing partys 2020 manifesto, it was all joy.

The NRAS is meant to take the undue burden of rent advance payments off the shoulders of all citizens who patronise it.

It has been designed for individuals with a reliable and verifiable source of income from the public and private sectors, as well as self-employed individuals.

To be eligible to join it, the applicant must be a Ghanaian; 18 years and above; possess a valid Ghana Card; must have a verifiable bank statement or mobile money statement; and rent payable must not exceed 30 percent of the household income.

We think the criterion shows some equity, which must be praised.

The scheme is said to increase the affordability of the tenants as only 30 percent of the tenants monthly income is all he or she needs to continue the rental agreement into perpetuity.

We think this clause must be explained well to clear every doubt in the minds of the people because, in absolute figures, 30 percent of peoples incomes vary.

It is reassuring to hear that the Government is committed to ensuring that every eligible Ghanaian can access the Scheme when needed.

To that end, apart from the initial seed capital, the government has committed to making annual budgetary allocations to support the expansion of the programme to all 16 regions of the country.

So far, GH19 million has been disbursed to 1,492 beneficiaries of the scheme.

It is a year now and a party stalwart, in the person of Francis Asenso-Boakye, the Minister of Works and Housing and Member of Parliament for Bantama Constituency in the Ashanti Region, has given a short overview of the scheme.

In part, he writes: As we mark the first anniversary since its (NRASs) inception, lets seize this occasion to enhance the successes attained thus far and strive to broaden its reach, ensuring that a greater number of deserving Ghanaians can benefit.

We will always refer to this statement and assess if this commitment is being upheld.",,Editorial,  7 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Uphold-commitment-to-rent-assistance-scheme-1915640
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Do decongestion with human face!,"It is good news to learn from the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) that has noticed that the trader population in Accra is ever-increasing, it has adopted plans to redesign the markets in the Central Business District in Accra to accommodate more traders.

The assembly acknowledges that the streets are no-go areas for selling, and so beginning this week, it will get the traders off the streets and pavements.

The Ghanaian Times appreciates moves by all assemblies in the country to ensure sanity in the system in one way or another.

In fact, the congestion in the city centre is a great nuisance for a number of reasons and needs to be eradicated.

Some people think the assemblies do not want to tackle it because their actions could jeopardise the fortunes of the ruling party in retaining power.

Therefore, it is a bold decision by the AMA to venture upon it, but much as we are not against the intended exercise, we plead that it must be delayed a bit to get the traders prepared for it.

We also plead that it should be done with human face.

Oftentimes, we hear complaints of the destruction of wares of some traders in decongestion exercises.

We also hear of harassments of the female traders in particular.

We should not lose sight of the fact that unemployment or lack of jobs in
the country has forced some people into trading with the little capital they can gather.

Besides, for some women especially, it is the petty trading they do that keeps them and their families going.

Therefore, their plight is worsened when these vulnerable people lose their capital as a result of the decongestion exercise.

Sometimes, the way some of the district assembly guards treat the street hawkers in such exercises calls for much concern.

We, therefore, think there must be a paradigm shift in which case there must be two or three phases of the exercise, with the first being the period of education and persuasion.

This must be to seek the cooperation of the traders so that the downside of the exercise may not emerge at all.

These traders are equally important in the growth of the countrys economy as they help, for instance, in emptying the manufacturers warehouse for more production or imports to be done.

We are also aware of the tolls the assemblies collect from them, as well as other taxes.

We are happy that the AMA is thinking of redesigning markets under its jurisdiction to accommodate more traders.

The naked truth is that street trading will continue to grow for as long as there are no jobs elsewhere; neither are there enough spaces in the available markets for people to occupy, coupled with the fact that it is very expensive to acquire or hire a shop for business.

Since trading has become a solace for some people amid the difficulty of securing jobs, we appeal to all district assemblies to put up markets that can make way for young people who would like to trade whether or not in anticipation of securing a certain job or travelling abroad.

That can help to ease the pressure of making a living.",,Editorial,  6 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Do-decongestion-with-human-face-1915427
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets jaw-jaw on implementation of VAT on electricity,"Peace, harmony, and tranquility are sine qua non to building progressive and inclusive democratic governance, and indeed, these elements are key in ensuring a conducive environment in election year.

The government as part of measures to mobilise revenues to tackle the numerous economic challenges facing the country, introduced VAT on electricity in accordance with its medium-term revenue strategic policy.

Indeed, the Ministry of Finance has issued a letter directing the two main electricity distribution companies  Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) and Northern Electricity Distribution Company (NEDCO), to start the implementation of VAT on residential customers, who consume electricity above lifeline.

The letter succinctly stated that as part of the implementation of the governments medium-term revenue strategy and the IMF-supported post-COVID-19 program for economic growth (PC-PEG), the implementation of VAT for residential customers of electricity above the maximum consumption level specified for block charges for lifeline units in line with section 35 and 37 and the first schedule (9) of VAT Act, 2013 (Act 870) has been scheduled for implementation, effective January 1, 2024.

For the avoidance of doubt, the letter dated December 12, 2023, pointed out that VAT is still exempt for a supply to a dwelling of electricity up to a maximum consumption level specified for block charges for lifeline units in line with sections 35 and 37 and the first schedule (9) of Act 870.

The issuance of the letter to the two electricity providers for the implementation of VAT on electricity on residential consumers above lifeline as part of the governments medium-term policy has triggered agitation on the labour front.

The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Dr. Yaw Baah, contended that the cost of electricity would go up by minimum 15 percent and all residential customers, who consume above the lifeline of 30 kilowatts hour, would pay 15 percent VAT, thereby exacerbating the cost of living in the country.

The organized labour union insisted that VAT on electricity must be withdrawn, and threatened to go on demonstration to compel the government to halt the implementation of the policy.

Similarly, addressing a press conference in Accra, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Consumer Protection Agency, Kofi Kapito, said the group would resist any attempt by the government to introduce what he described as killer tax on electricity users.

Consequently, the Finance Ministry has issued a press statement noting the concerns of organised labour on the implementation of VAT on the consumption of electricity by residential customers, hinting at extensive dialogue to be held with organised labour and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, to ensure stakeholder buy-in.

We at Ghanaian Times take a serious view of these threats, because of the implication on industrial harmony and peace of the country, especially in an election year.

We believe that not much has been done towards building a national consensus, especially with organised labour on the implementation of the policy.

It is, therefore, our considered opinion that the government jaw-jaw with organised labour, to reach a consensus for the benefit of both parties so that the policy does not bring a further burden on the ordinary Ghanaians who consume electricity.",,Editorial,  5 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-jaw-jaw-on-implementation-of-VAT-on-electricity-1915200
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: End E-waste collection centre encroachment, other cases","The decision by the Parliamentary Select Committee on Environment, Science, and Technology to push for the eviction of persons whose houses are close to the E-waste collection centre around the Atomic Energy Commission at Kwabenya in Accra, raises questions critical to the countrys development.

We are learning that per a publication by the Central Pollution Control Board of India in 2017, the recommended buffer from an E-waste site should be at least 200 metres, but some of the houses in the case at issue now are as close as 100 metres.

The question is, who first owned the land on which those houses were built and how did it come to be owned by the house owners?

And even if they acquired the land legally, how come they flouted the distance dictated by the buffer zone?

This is where the wonder of Dr. Emmanuel Marfo, Chairman of the Select Committee, as to why authorities could allow residential facilities to be erected so close to the site, considering the health implications of residing in such an environment, is a critical question that must be answered by the authorities.

We think in its recommendations, the committee must be vehement about this and get to the bottom of the matter.

To us, the E-waste case is one of many that have not been tackled, which gives others the impetus to perpetrate such illegality and nuisance, in spite of the dangers to human life and other implications.

We wish to help Dr Marfo dispel his wonder (if he is the only stranger in Jerusalem) by saying that the problem has arisen because of the lack of law enforcement, corruption in general, misuse of state power by certain state officials and other big men like chiefs, and the neglect of duty by the district assemblies, their mere ineptitude or powerlessness.

Can the district assembly having oversight of the E-waste dumpsite give any excuse or explanation to justify what has happened?

We think the current case must not be treated with kids gloves.

Thus, when it is raised in Parliament or any other appropriate quarters, the eviction should not attract needless debate to waste time and energy.

We can fathom that some lawyers have started thinking of going to the aid of the owners of properties in the E-waste dumpsite.

If that actually happens, we will not mince words to describe such lawyers as nation wreckers and people who do not value human life as they would have overlooked the dangers looming around the affected houses.

We know the eviction is going to cost the state some money, which would have been avoided if there had been some vigilance on the part of, at least, the district assembly because it is the institution that leads development in the area.

Were the houses in such a critical area erected with permits from the assembly?

If so, was the environmental impact assessment done?

We think if nothing at all, all the people who have a hand in the encroachment must be found and surcharged with any cost that will be incurred as a result of the eviction, which we believe will involve the demolition of the houses.

It is time to check indiscriminate development as that has a lot of negative implications for the countrys progress.",,Editorial,  2 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-End-E-waste-collection-centre-encroachment-other-cases-1914732
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Women too need to qualify for appointments,"Calls by women to be given equal representation as men, especially in the political space, keep growing.

Therefore, it is not surprising that four women-centred civil society organisations (CSOs) and another organisation are calling on President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to appoint a number of women who will form at least 60 percent of the 30 percent membership of the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDs) who are classified as government appointees.

The four, the Network for Womens Rights in Ghana (NETRIGHT), the Alliance for Women in Media Africa (AWMA), the Affirmative Action Bill Coalition, and the Womens Manifesto Coalition (WMC); as well as the National Association of Local Authorities of Ghana (NALAG) maintain that there is an unaccepted under-representation of women in decision-making positions in Ghana, which remains a matter of grave concern, especially at the local level.

The concerns of the organisations cannot be discounted because women are very important people in society due to the obvious roles they play in the survival and continuity of society.

It is not in dispute either that women have moderating traits that help to ensure peace in society.

Besides, women are mostly known to be less corrupt than men so when they are in charge of situations, fairness rules to a large extent, and corruption is not too much of a headache.

We know women face certain peculiar challenges, but some of the arguments advanced for their equal representation in decision-making in the country must be critically analysed.

In the first place, what is the basis for the request for 60 percent appointments?

The women are their own witnesses when they agree that some strides have been made to address the level of disparity in decision-making, particularly in the governance space.

A question then arises with regard to the claim that there seems not to be comprehensive efforts in prioritising womens equal access to leadership and positions of decision-making.

We know women are pushing for Affirmative Action in many areas of society, but they need to put the brakes on certain areas where there are no instances of discrimination such as the political space in the country, including the local governance system.

There is no political party or group in the country that has openly stood up against womens participation in the countrys political administration and so restricting women in one way or another; neither is there a law in the country doing so.

The truth rather is that most women refuse to contest for elected positions and appointed positions are usually offered on merit, based on certain qualifications.

For instance, government appointees to the district assemblies should be persons of professional and other backgrounds needed by the assemblies, but cannot be guaranteed or found in the elected members because any adult citizen of sound mind can stand to be elected.

This means women can be appointed if they qualify.

We are in an era when merit is the order of the day for positions in the governance space and elsewhere, meaning positions cannot be earned on a silver platter.

Thus, what women or womens affairs advocates should do is push women to prepare for such positions.

It is when they are prepared but are discriminated against that there will be the cause to roar against discrimination and marginalisation of women in decision-making in the country.",,Editorial,  1 February 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Women-too-need-to-qualify-for-appointments-1914523
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Obey GMet harmattan advice,"The Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) has advised Ghanaians to be aware of the health risks posed by the harmattan.

 Harmattan is a very dry, dusty north-easterly wind that occurs on the West African coast.

 In Ghana, all things being equal, the weather phenomenon can be experienced from November to March.

 It comes with all the associated risks, including the ones related to the health of people.

 We think the advice by the GMet is timely and proactive.

 What is left is the readiness of the people to heed it.

 Truth be told that Ghanaians in general take such matters for granted and make it appear that the agency or any source giving the advice is wasting its time.

 We saw how some people employed all manner of theories as an excuse to refuse adherence to measures to combat COVID-19 in the country.

 We think it is about time people abandoned such reckless behaviour and adhered to such pieces of advice, particularly those that come as health warnings.

 It is much of a gain to obey such warnings and related precautionary measures than to avoid them and suffer the risks.

 We, therefore, wish to appeal to the public to obey the GMet's advice and live free from all the risks that accompany harmattan.

 The benefits are enormous, particularly for those who have allergic conditions like asthma that can be triggered during the period.

 They would be saved from the increasing or worsening pain and suffering which has repercussions, including the worries of family members.

 Apart from the health risks, the harmattan period is also one of fire outbreaks, including bushfires with all the repercussions.

 When farmers, for instance, lose their crops to the fires, the story does not end there.

 That loss reduces the amount of food to be produced in the year and once the quantity expected falls short, prices would rise.

 That means the farmers refusal to take precautions against the bushfire has gone around to come and torment everyone.

 This means that the GMet advice is for the entire country, to the extent that the cautious among the people must point to the recklessness of the erring ones.

 The benefits of that single act would do the entire nation good.

 Let us therefore take all the precautionary measures to promote our well-being during the period, including taking a lot of water to remain hydrated.

 We must wear face masks to prevent ourselves from inhaling the excessive dust in the atmosphere.

 Harmattan also brings about cool temperatures, especially from dawn into the early hours of the morning.

 This calls for the wearing of the appropriate clothes to fight the associated coldness.

 One other risk of harmattan is poor visibility. This makes movement difficult, especially at night and even early morning.

 The low visibility is a more serious matter on the road as it can cause traffic accidents.

 At best, drivers should wait for visibility to improve but if they will not, then they should avoid reckless acts like speeding, leaving breakdown vehicles on the road, stopping in the middle of the road, and having faulty lights.

 We hope we all will avoid the harmattan risks so we will have a happy story to tell about the weather phenomenon this year.",,Editorial, 30 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Obey-GMet-harmattan-advice-1914064
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: We wish GIADEC well,"We hope that the move by the Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC) to construct a bauxite refinery at Nyinahin-Mpasaaso in the Ashanti Region will come to pass for all its benefits.

 It is common knowledge that countries that export raw commodities gain little from their God-given resources, whereas the countries buying the commodities derive multiple benefits.

 This is so because the importing countries have established refineries and other facilities which they use to extract every good thing from the raw commodities to the extent that sometimes even wastes from the process of refining the commodities become useful by-products for direct use or for manufacture of other products.

 Viewing the situation from that perspective, we can only commend the GIADEC for going to establish a bauxite refinery in the country.

 We know their efforts could not be fruitful without the backing of the government in all the relevant areas, so we also commend the Akufo-Addo government for pushing for this move.

 Bauxite refineries produce alumina (aluminum oxide), which is used to create aluminum metal.

 Bauxite is also used to manufacture other products like abrasives, steel, cement, and chemicals like petroleum products.

 It is clear that if the country gets a bauxite refinery,

 the multiple benefits of the mineral would accrue to it and strengthen its economy.

 This obviously will enable the country to put an end to decades of exporting raw bauxite.

 It is worthy of note that the refinery will create more than 1,500 jobs over time while building collaboration with local subcontractors, prioritising local talent, and organising training programmes that align with cultural and environmental considerations.

 That is to say that the activities of the refinery will be culturally and environmentally-friendly.

 This is good because the country has had to deal with situations where the public or certain groups have risen against the operations of some concerns or firms. After all, the operations are environmentally and culturally hurting.

 It is significant that before even establishing the bauxite refinery, GIADEC has anticipated the harm it could create and as such planned to forestall that.

 This is a mark of a corporate citizen who values the sanctity of the relationship between firms and their host communities.

 While we commend GIADEC for this important act, we recommend it to prospective investors, both local and foreign, and appeal to operating investors having issues with the host communities to do all they can to resolve them.

 It is our prayer also that once the refinery becomes operative, the prices of the products it will help to produce on the value chain will be reduced for the people to feel its presence or impact.

 We expect this because the importation of such products must cease or reduce drastically in which case the cost of procuring them would likely reduce.

 If all goes well for GIADEC, we expect that one day it will venture into importing raw bauxite from Mozambique and Guinea, the biggest producer in Africa, where refineries are yet to be established.

 We wish GIADEC all the best in its endeavours.",,Editorial, 29 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-We-wish-GIADEC-well-1913816
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Use dialogue to resolve 15% electricity VAT matter,"On Tuesday, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) gave the government a seven-day ultimatum to withdraw a 15-per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) it has planned to charge on electricity consumed by a category of domestic customers.

According to the TUC, it has sighted a circular originating from the Ministry of Finance, dated December 12, 2023, and signed by the sector minister, Mr. Kenneth Ofori-Atta, directing the Electricity Company of Ghana and Northern Electricity Distribution Company to start the implementation of VAT for residential customers using electricity above the maximum consumption level specified for block charges for lifeline units in line with Sections 35 and 37 and first schedule (9) of (VAT) Act, 2013 (Act 870).

The implementation is effective January 1, 2024, which means barring the unexpected, the specified customers would have their electricity bill increased by the 15 percent VAT charges.

Seeing this as exploitative and regressive, because the tax will reduce the purchasing power of consumers or increase the cost of living, the TUC has asked the government to withdraw the letter and stop the two power distributors from carrying out the directive or the Congress would advise itself.

The TUC basically seeks the welfare of workers and since workers labour for the progress of society, it also stands up against anything that will hurt society and, for that reason, calls for changes that can benefit the worker and the society as a whole.

We think this role qualifies the TUC to make certain moves like the current one, especially as the VAT charges will not affect only organised labour but others, most of whom are people who earn a living.

We also think even though the government is right in its action, the TUC action is a way of demanding accountability and fairness from the government in a matter relating to power, a sector very critical to the whole country,

But for the move by the TUC, the governments action would have happened on the blind side of many of the affected power consumers.

On a daily basis, many power consumers complain about inflated or overcharged bills and so we believe that all increases in utility bills must be made known and well explained to the public.

It is good to have such public education so that all the stakeholders or their representatives can offer their input in one way or another.

Even protests like that of the TUC are based on reasons that can be useful after all.

Much as many would commend the TUC for its move, we believe in all matters, dialogue is always better than threats and violence.

Therefore, the TUC should choose dialogue over the threat that it will advise itself if the government does not withdraw the letter and, thus stop the implementation of its directive by January 31.

If such threats become the norm in the country, every recognised group or organisation can find occasion to oppose the actions of the government if they do not sit well with them.

The implications then would be dire, so such threats and ultimatums must be the last resort.

We cannot always attribute sinister motives to government actions; where even the sinister motive is clear, we should find a way to make the government acknowledge it before being forced to find the remedy to its move.

It is our hope that calm would reign in this matter and consensus between the government and the TUC would resolve it.",,Editorial, 25 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Use-dialogue-to-resolve-15-electricity-VAT-matter-1913153
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Biz Box critical to reduce unemployment challenges,"Due to the high unemployment rate in the country, especially among the youth, any move to reduce it, however, the magnitude, is commendable.

This is why we commend the government for the launch of the project dubbed the Business in a Box (Biz Box) meant to provide employment for some 250,000 youth.

It is critical to learn that the project focuses on sectors such as agriculture, agribusiness, tourism, creative industry, building, and construction.

It is common knowledge that the aforementioned sectors are pivots of the countrys economy and so any initiatives in them give them new life.

This then gives the hope that the country stands to gain from these sectors in future generations.

However, our concern is much more on the beneficiaries of the $55-million project to be implemented across the country  the youth and certain vulnerable groups like Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) and vulnerable females.

It is also a delight to hear that majority of women-owned businesses and female youth-led businesses are going to be prioritised.

It is our prayer that the Biz Box would succeed and be a catalyst for more such projects to particularly provide employment for the youth and vulnerable groups.

This is important because unemployment among these groups has dire implications for the individuals and the country in various ways.

The PWDs, for instance, are seen by even families as a burden and so in some cases, they are neglected and life becomes so miserable for them.

The Biz Box, therefore, can bring some happiness into the lives of these people.

With regard to the youth in general, it can be said the case is not palatable at all.

Without a doubt, the youth will have to take up the mantle of leadership in the near future and that can only be easy for youth who are prepared in knowledge, skills, and substance.

Generally, youth unemployment is a security threat to the country.

The government, therefore, has to make every effort to solve youth unemployment to stem all its challenges.

This is critical because even if the youth have all the knowledge and skills but have no sources of income, they would lack the emotional and mental stability to do anything meaningful for themselves and society.

The Biz Box is, thus, one important initiative to prepare the youth for that economic stability that can be a springboard for the youth to explore and venture into dream areas.

The aspect of the project to offer 125,000 of the beneficiaries with start-up kits, provide market access support to 50,000 businesses, and give regulatory support to 40,000 businesses must be hailed.

We only want to appeal that such support must not be discriminatory but meritorious so that at the end of the day, competent hands can leverage it to add more value to the initiative.

As envisaged by the government, we expect that the Biz Box would help prepare a group of youth able to initiate, develop, own, and grow successful businesses, and acquit themselves as a generation of entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders, who in the future can help others turn their dreams into remarkable achievements.",,Editorial, 23 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Biz-Box-critical-to-reduce-unemployment-challenges-1912710
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Listen to calls for UN reforms,"President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has reiterated the resolve of Ghana in advocating sweeping reforms in the United Nations (UN) to enable it to address the numerous challenges confronting the global community.

The UN was formed in 1945 to ensure world peace based on the proposals from representatives of China, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA).

The UN Charter therefore gave veto power and permanent membership to these five countries, sometimes referred to as the P5, in the hope that their status would ensure their participation in the UN and particularly its Security Council.

Over the years, some UN members have called for reforms in the UN due to certain happenings across the globe.

President Akufo-Addos statement that we belong to the side that are advocating radical reforms.... obviously affirms it.

The experts say that even though there have been calls for reforms in the UN since the 1990s, there has not been a consensus as to where and how the reforms should take effect.

However, it is clear the focus is on the use or rather misuse of the veto power held by the P5.

Interestingly the US, one of the P5, is also calling for reforms but the experts say they do not believe it will allow its vote power to be touched.

The truth is that the P5 have the privilege as the only members with the authority to make binding decisions, especially at the Security Council.

This means the P5 can stop some of the Security Council decisions, however critical they are to the rest of the193 States constituting the UN.

Definitely, this is not palatable to the 188 other States who joined the P5 to form its General Assembly, which is the main deliberative, policymaking, and most representative organ of the UN.

It is said, for instance, that in the past, the P5 used the UN Security Council to create common action against belligerents in the international system such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq,

However, they fail to take any meaningful actions on a number of issues if one or two of them do not see the actions to be in their national interest.

This shows the greatest bias on the part of the P5 but it seems for now it is not easy to touch them.

Imagine that as of May 2022, Russia/USSR has used its veto 121 times, the US 82 times, the UK 29 times, China 17 times, and France 16 times.

From the look of things, it is clear the UN needs reforms but it appears the reforms are difficult to realise.

However, we encourage President Akufo-Addo and others like President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye to continue with their calls for reforms even beyond the Security Council.

We believe one day, such calls can appeal to the conscience of the P5 to see the need to listen to the rest of the world and veto the desires of the whole world.",,Editorial, 12 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Listen-to-calls-for-UN-reforms-1911854
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Leverage New Year School for sustainable development,"We are glad to open the year with some views about the New Year School and Conference, simply referred to by some as the New Year School, which opened at the University of Ghana, Legon, yesterday.

As an annual event, this years is the 75th and on the theme Nurturing Resilience: Adopting Technology And Embracing Humanism For Sustainable Development. 

The school is important because it brings together academics, policymakers, the leadership of civil society organisations, business leaders, and other stakeholders, who discuss critical issues of both national and global nature and see how best Ghana can benefit from them for its development and progress.

While opening the 75th Annual New Year School and Conference yesterday, the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, confirmed this importance when he said successive governments, including the current one, had over the past 75 years benefited immensely from the productive outcomes, innovative ideas and constructive criticisms that had emerged from it.

He explained that such contributions had shaped policy decisions and directions over the years by addressing critical issues regarding the national economy, education, nation-building, democracy, and elections, as well as other topical issues carefully selected to tackle peculiar challenges at any point in the history of Ghana.

We wish to say that there are currently challenges that appear to defy solutions but need urgent tackling whether they are discussed at the New Year School or not.

Such challenges include the lack of law enforcement in the country, which has festered acts of lawlessness that sometimes defy the understanding of good citizens.

The theme for this years New Year School, Nurturing Resilience: Adopting Technology And Embracing Humanism For Sustainable Development, is truly apt but this cannot bear the expected fruits if negative attitudes in the country are not changed.

It is sad to say that some of the negative attitudes have the tacit support of certain personalities who should know better, including politicians and chiefs.

We see the timing of the New Year School and Conference in January, the first month of the year, as appropriate.

This is because some of the issues raised border on the evaluation of challenges in the year gone by and stakeholders can have the opportunity to make amends.

The country can see the development it envisages only when its leaders can adopt ways like laws and their enforcement to contain negative attitudes that mar progress.

This year is critical for the country because it is an election year and we know the negative things associated with elections in the country.

However, we want to appeal that all stakeholders should use the New Year School as the reference point of advice to eschew violence and maintain peace in the country.

We also expect that every Ghanaian will leverage all the issues raised at the three-day event for the countrys progress in all sectors of its economy.",,Editorial, 10 January 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Leverage-New-Year-School-for-sustainable-development-1910432
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check percentage hike in passport application fees!,"Yesterday, we carried out a story about the proposal by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration to increase passport application fees from the current GH100 to GH644, which is a 544-percent increment.

We have taken note of all the explanations given, yet we find parts of it very unfortunate.

For instance, we find it unfortunate Ms. Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, compared the passport fees paid in Ghana to those in other West African countries and concluded that Ghanaians pay less and so it is time for Ghanaians to pay realistic prices for passports they acquire to travel beginning next year.

Her comment seems to suggest that the move is concluded as she was bold enough to state the effective time, next year, which we can interpret to be any date from January 1, 2024.

When state officials speak like this, the impression is that no other authority can cause them to change their decision(s) or proposal(s).

Why did she not compare the services given to passport applicants in places like Cameroun and Burkina Faso to those offered in Ghana?

Besides, is the minister or the ministry telling Ghanaians that passport application fees in those countries arrived the way the ministry wants to do it in Ghana?

Much as we are not against increment in the fees, we think the hike is too outrageous and shocking  from GH100 to GH644, which is a 544-per-cent increment.

We think the increment should be gradual and at a certain regular interval till the point when full-cost recovery could be achieved and we take it from there to ensure sanity, going forward.

While this is done, it should be possible for Ghanaians to enjoy seamless services to the extent that the human interface in the process should be possible only when it is really necessary.

Currently, we talk about digitalising the process, yet it is an open secret that most applicants have to see middlemen to be able to acquire the passport.

We know ministry officials would deny this but it is happening and so we would like them to take note and plug all loopholes so that applicants would not be frustrated by forcing them to pay unofficial fees in the passport acquisition process.

One other issue we have exception to is that the passport no longer serves as a primary identification document for Ghanaians, so only those who need it to travel must acquire it and those not in a hurry to embark on any international travel should not go for it.

Elsewhere, every citizen applies for a passport no matter whether he or she is traveling soon or not or not traveling at all.

The advice sounds prudent but that is not an issue; the problem has to do with the hike in the passport application fees.

The hike has implications not only for passport applicants but also the Ghanaian consumers as a whole.

If the government can just wake up and increase the charges for a product or service by 544 percent, claiming all manner of explanations to justify it, that government cannot have the moral right to appeal to traders and others to reduce their prices and charges.

At the end of the day, the sufferer or whipping boy is the consumer.

Therefore, we appeal to the Ministry to check the percentage increase in the passport application fees.",,Editorial, 19 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-percentage-hike-in-passport-application-fees-1901243
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Vote in your numbers in tomorrows elections!!,"Tomorrow is the day for Ghanaians to vote in district-level elections (DLEs) to elect people to represent them in the various Metropolitan, Municipal, and District assemblies (MMDAs), collectively known as district assemblies.

They are also to elect Unit Committee members for the various electoral areas.

All things being equal, voting is expected to begin at 7 a.m. tomorrow and close officially at 5 p.m. but as usual, if there should be some voters in a queue, they will be allowed to cast their votes.

We, however, implore voters to go to the voting centres early enough so that the polls can end at 5 p.m., for the counting of votes to begin on schedule.

It is 10 hours from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and so we have to imagine how it feels for the elections officials to be stuck at one place for just the voting before the counting of votes.

Let's remember the axiom Do unto others what you want others to do to you and go to vote early enough to save the officials some of the trouble like stress.

After all, the Deputy Chair of the EC in charge of Corporate Services, Dr. Eric Bossman Asare, says with the adequate preparations so far made, a voter would spend less than five minutes to cast his or her vote once they get to the table to go through the process.

Like the Presidential and Parliamentary elections held in the country, the DLEs are held every four years.

However, unlike the presidential and parliamentary elections, the DLEs are not patronised as expected.

So far the highest turnout is 59.3 percent recorded in 1988/89, whereas the highest for the Presidential and parliamentary elections achieved in 2004 was over 80 percent.

The Chairperson of the Electoral Commission (EC), Ms Jean Mensa, had earlier said her outfit was targeting at least 60 percent turnout in tomorrows elections.

However, Dr. Bossman-Asare says a 70-percent turnout is expected as compared to 50 percent on December 17, 2019.

We see this as the affirmation of the fact that the Commission has done all it could for the target to be achieved.

We are particularly encouraged by the fact that voters who have misplaced their Voters Card would just have to give their full names to the EC officials who will identify them by their surnames on the voters register and they are set to cast their ballot after going through the Biometric Verification system.

We hope other voter challenges can thus easily be resolved.

Whatever the case is, we implore registered voters to turn out in their numbers to elect the candidates that appeal to them as the ones who can best serve them.

It is our conviction that probably the people have not seen their aspirations being met by the assemblies, which is why they do not take a keen interest in the DLEs.

Perhaps, the people must be educated more on the importance of the district assembly system and the need for them to idolise it and demand accountability from the assembly members and their respective MMDAs.

They should understand that the district assemblies were introduced to allow the peoples participation in governance at the local level and for the assemblies to guide the socio-economic development of their jurisdictions.",,Editorial, 18 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Vote-in-your-numbers-in-tomorrow-rsquo-s-elections-1900664
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Transport operators attempt to check drivers commendable,"We commend transport operators or associations in Accra which have so far cautioned their drivers against indiscipline, including reckless driving, especially during the Christmas and New Year festivities, or face sanctions, including suspension and dismissal.

We appeal to others in Accra and elsewhere who have not done so to take a cue from their fellows who have done it.

Over the years the number of road crashes, deaths, and injuries have been higher during festivities, particularly Christmas.

It is sad to observe that despite the road safety education given to drivers in the country on a regular basis, a number of them remain recalcitrant.

Therefore, reminders to drivers to be disciplined and more cautious during festivities are helpful but the question is, Why do some drivers gloss over road safety measures?

We can conjecture that some are naturally recalcitrant, while others do so because the laws regulating driving on the road are not deterrent enough or their associations are not tough enough.

It is also an open secret that the police, who should arrest and prosecute them, take bribes from them and leave them to go away free.

It is always said that road safety is a shared responsibility and it seems this has now dawned on O.A Travel Tour, Neoplan Branch No. 4, and the 2M Express transport operators at Circle in Accra more than ever before to be tougher on their drivers this time and beyond.

We are particularly happy with their measures to check the use of hard drugs by the drivers and their recklessness on the road, including speeding and wrongful over-taking; ensure the good health of drivers, and top it all up with punishment for recalcitrant drivers.

We are happy to hear that such recalcitrant drivers would either be suspended or dismissed by the operators (See our story on page 11).

Much as we support the measures being taken by the operators, we think mere suspension or dismissal is not enough because such reckless drivers can migrate to other places to resume driving.

We believe that such drivers must be blacklisted so that they cannot drive anywhere in the country, even if temporarily or permanently as the case may be.

It should even be possible to ensure their prosecution if their behaviour is found in a way to be criminal.

Even though the statistics since 2021 seem to suggest some decrease in road crashes, fatalities, and injuries, the figures are still too high to be tolerated.

For instance, 1,433 people died from road accidents across the country from January to August, this year, according to the National Road Safety Authority (NSRA).

The figure represents an 11.27 percent decrease in the 1,615 deaths recorded within the same period, last year.

Additionally, 10,367 persons suffered injuries, showing a 0.47 percent decrease in the 10,416 injuries recorded within the same period in 2022.

It is on record that in Ghana, 72 persons out of every 100, 000 population suffered from grievous bodily injury, and about eight of the same figure died from road traffic accidents over the past decade.

Even one death from drivers recklessness is too many because of its implications for families and the country at large.

Therefore any move to check drivers recklessness at any time is laudable and must be supported by all.",,Editorial, 15 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Transport-operators-rsquo-attempt-to-check-drivers-commendable-1899302
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Reconstruction of Kasoa-Winneba Junction road laudable,"The move by the government to re-construct the 30-kilometer Kasoa-Winneba Junction road into a dual carriageway with interchanges from January next year is a good one.

This is because its completion would bring a lot of relief to users of that stretch, both drivers and passengers, as well as communities along it.

The current single-lane is noted for traffic congestion; carelessness of drivers who want to jump the gridlock; waste of man-hours; inconvenience suffered by pedestrians crossing it; and environmental pollution.

All these problems have their individual implications for drivers, passengers, particularly the commuters among them; and the communities along the road.

Imagine just the discomfort or stress suffered in a long stay in traffic from the heat in the tropical climate, the fumes (carbon monoxide) emitted by vehicles, and the noise around.

These alone have serious implications for the health of the affected people.

The fuel burnt in traffic and the man-hours lost, as well as contracts and other opportunities missed are costly and some of the losses can have heavy negative effects on some people.

There is one effect of traffic congestion which goes beyond the communities on the affected stretch to others elsewhere in the country and this is serious in the case of the Kasoa-Winneba Junction stretch.

This is the undermining of the socio-cultural and economic lives of the people, which people tend to overlook in spite of its heavy toll.

Do you know that some people have an aversion to travelling on the Kasoa-Winneba stretch because of the heavy traffic congestion on it and all its implications and so avoid patronising socio-cultural activities that would necessitate using that road?

This means such people would refuse to attend funerals, weddings, and festivals, for instance, in communities along the stretch and its vicinity, and those elsewhere in the Central, Western, and Western North regions as well as parts of the Ashanti Region like Obuasi and surrounding areas once they have to use that road.

Even when they do, they itch to leave at a time when the events have not reached their peak.

This undermines the value and beauty of the events because usually, it is the presence of a good number of people at such events that helps to mark them as being successful.

If the events call for the donation of cash, some visitors leave before that point is reached and the organisers or the communities lose those instances where people would have shown some benevolence.

Taking all these and other problems into consideration, we wish to commend the government ahead of the commencement of the reconstruction works.

We hope it will sustain the seriousness with which it has announced the project and extend the same to its monitoring to ensure that quality and time are being adhered to.

The specifications for the road and its furniture, as well as the interchanges, must not be distorted.

The 30-month schedule for the works must be adhered to because even though the reconstruction brings the expected relief, road construction generally causes inconvenience for drivers, passengers, and communities and a longer period would worsen the situation.

We hope the contractor will do a good job and the affected communities will offer the needed support.",,Editorial, 14 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Reconstruction-of-Kasoa-Winneba-Junction-road-laudable-1898675
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets consider partisan district assembly system,"At long last, Tuesday, December 19, 2023, is the day for Ghanaians to vote in district-level elections (DLEs) to elect members to the various Metropolitan, Municipal, and District assemblies, collectively known as district assemblies.

They are also to elect Unit Committee members for the various electoral areas.

Like the Presidential and Parliamentary elections held in the country, the DLEs are held every four years.

The district assemblies were introduced to allow the peoples participation in governance at the local level and for the assemblies to guide the socio-economic development of their jurisdictions.

We think as others do that the district assembly concept is good as it promotes decentralisation and all its benefits.

Due to the importance of the district assemblies, it is expected that the local people would take a keen interest in it and collectively elect community members who can be trusted to spearhead development at the local level.

However, it is clear that such enthusiasm is absent because of certain challenges that must be addressed.

The first and very critical one relates to the eroding of the non-partisan nature of the assemblies.

The idea was that a non-partisan district assembly would help deepen decentralisation, probably because there would not be competing partisan interests, and real men and women could be elected to the assemblies and unit committees.

Over the years, the assemblies and the DLEs have become overly partisan, though in a tacit manner.

As in the recent past, the political parties at the local level are promoting candidates they wish to be elected to indirectly seek their interests at the assemblies.

This defeats the non-partisan nature of the district assembly and brings in some of the ills associated with political party elections such as vote-buying, which has created voter apathy to some extent.

However, even the Electoral Commission (EC) has identified the non-partisan nature of the DLEs as a major factor contributing to the low turnouts over the years.

Mr. Samuel Guggisberg Asrifi-Young, the Bono Regional Director of the EC, confirmed this in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Sunyani recently while talking about the ECs efforts to increase turnout at this years DLEs.

In fact, the Chairperson of the EC, Jean Mensa, has said that the EC is targeting at least a 60 percent turnout.

If this happens, it will be a great achievement because it will beat the highest turnout so far, 59.3 percent in 1988/89.

Meanwhile, the B&FT Online, a portal owned by Business and Financial Times newspaper, yesterday published that if voter turnout in the last three decades of DLEs in Ghana is anything to go by, then it is safe to predict that less than 35 percent of the voter population will patronise Tuesdays DLEs.

In fact, an article published in the Journal of Science and Technology (Ghana) on November 19, 2014 says a non-partisan district assembly system seems more of an illusion than reality due to the enduring strength of informal ties, heavy politicisation of the district assemblies, numerous challenges confronting the Assembly members.

It recommends that to deepen the countrys democracy, the legal framework needs to be revised for competitive partisan DLEs to be pursued and assembly members paid for their work.

We think the circumstances support a partisan District Assembly system and the State must give the suggestion a thought.",,Editorial, 13 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-rsquo-s-consider-partisan-district-assembly-system-1897997
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let BEAP deliver its promise!,"Since it took office in January 2017, the Akufo-Addo administration has been introducing initiatives to address particularly youth unemployment in the country, including the Business and Employment Assistance Programme (BEAP), the latest youth initiative.

Coming as one of the flagship programmes of the Youth Employment Agency (YEA), the BEAP aims to nurture young entrepreneurs, empowering them to create employment opportunities for the large pool of unemployed youth in the country.

The Ghanaian youth have many challenges, which dim their hopes of a bright future and so initiatives that give them a ray of hope must be applauded and supported to survive.

We know that there have been challenges with some of the youth initiatives so far pursued.

For instance, there have been challenges with allowances paid to the youth such as their meagerness and delayed payment, as well as the limited number of beneficiaries as was the case with the YouStart programme.

The YouStart was piloted with 70 beneficiaries with the promise that the initiative will be enhanced to effectively assist more youth-led businesses in the coming years.

However, we see the BEAP as giving some ray of hope because of what it has to offer by way of a departure from the previous initiatives and their challenges, yet not dismissing the possibility of it having its own problems though.

For instance, a sum of GH120 million has been earmarked for BEAP and it is anticipated that it would benefit 10,000 MSMEs and 20,000 young Ghanaians.

What is exciting about it all is that each of the beneficiary MSMEs is expected to engage a maximum of five employees, who will be given a monthly allowance of GH 500 to top up their regular salary for one year, which is crucial support for businesses to recover and expand.

Even though businesses in the country had their challenges, the emergence of COVID-19 and its disruption of businesses worsened the situation, with some businesses either laying off workers or being unable to employ additional workers.

There are still others reducing wages or refusing to increase them despite rising prices of goods and services that have eroded the value of earnings.

The BEAP is, therefore, a saviour of some sort as it comes in to reduce unemployment and increase earnings.

We only hope that everything will go as planned so that the expectations of the countrys youth will not be cut off.

While we say that, we wish to appeal to the beneficiary businesses to not stop paying their youthful employees because of the GH500 allowance given to them under BEAP.

We are saying this because of mistreatment given to young workers at certain workplaces to the extent that some are not paid for months and when they raise issue with it, they are branded as bad persons and dismissed or punished in other ways.

Therefore, we want to express the firmest of hopes that the government will monitor and check such instances and make the BEAP the good initiative that it has been planned to be.

That way, we believe, it can cause better successor initiatives to be born just as we believe it is better than its predecessors.",,Editorial, 12 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-BEAP-deliver-its-promise-1897328
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Security-consciousness needed more during Yuletide,"The advice from the Ministry of National Security to organisers and patrons of upcoming events in the Xmas festive season to put in place measures that would enhance security during the period is very critical.

For the ministry, the advice has become necessary because of the emerging security threats in the nations neighbouring countries, particularly terrorism.

We agree with the ministry but think that alone must not be the reason because criminal elements within the country also can take advantage of security lapses to commit other crimes like mugging and assault on revellers, and robbery at homes where occupants have left for certain programmes.

Since advice on security measures is needed in everyday life, we see the current advice as one needed for a special occasion, Christmas.

This is a period noted for its happiness for a number of reasons such as the reunion of family members, church activities and various entertainment events which usually call for gathering, the fertile ground for all manner of crime to fester.

We, therefore, think even churches must heed the advice the more because of the huge crowds they pull for their activities during the Yuletide.

We urge churches that are already security-conscious to do more, but for those that are not, we want to remind them that it will be an error for them to continue to compromise their security in the erroneous belief that only the children of God would patronise their activities.

We accept the fact that hospitality facilities and all event organisers should invest in appropriate and fit-for-purpose equipment to enhance security, but the advice on the need to build cooperation with the security agencies is equally important, if not more.

Our conviction is that security has become so much more important in present times than ever before and so it will take expert advice to take the appropriate measures to prevent or counter certain criminal moves or acts and the expert advice can only come from those trained in security.

Certainly, it will be difficult to prevent or quell all crimes, but it is possible to plug the known loopholes and reduce crime.

It is good news to hear that the security agencies would continue to provide advice on specific security and safety issues through training and capacity building for the public.

This is important because the security-consciousness of the populace has become more important now than ever before.

Today, everyone needs to have a basic idea of how to detect or suspect crime and prevent it, so National security and security agencies, particularly the police, should begin to organise programmes, particularly at the community level, to raise the security awareness of the people.

This is one of the surest ways to make everyone accept the fact that security anywhere is a shared responsibility and that precaution begins with the individual.

In fact, this is also a way that will help strengthen the See something say something campaign being run in the country.

We hope that both individuals and event organisers will follow all the necessary security measures while security personnel monitor the scenes before, during and even moments after the Yuletide to safeguard the peace and security in the country.",,Editorial, 11 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Security-consciousness-needed-more-during-Yuletide-1896542
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Consider criticisms for better lithium deal,"October this year, the government signed a lithium mining lease agreement with Barari DV Limited, a subsidiary of Atlantic Lithium Limited, an Australia-based firm, to mine lithium at Ewoyaa in the Mfantseman Municipality of the Central Region.

The agreement said to have been signed after more than 15 months of negotiations has attracted criticisms from both individuals and some institutions, including former Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo.

She mentions joint ventures and service contracts as some of the methods that are much better than a lease.

The other critics agree with Justice Akuffo that the lease agreement is archaic as it is like those of colonial times and that the government must have sole ownership of mining resources to ensure that citizens benefit from it fully.

To them, that is the modern best practice where the host country is the owner and can contract a mining company through a transparent competitive bidding process to mine the mineral and to reinvest for its cost of production plus profit margin so that the mining company is in contract with the owner.

In the current agreement, the government has a 19 percent stake that will subsequently increase to 30 percent.

However, the government, particularly the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Mr. Samuel Abu Jinapor, and some individuals like Sir Sam Jonah and the CEO of Minerals Commission are defending it as favorable to Ghana, surpassing all those other lithium leases around the world.

We think the arguments, particularly the criticisms, are raising issues that can be looked at, if need be, for reframing the lease agreement.

We are happy the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources says the government is open to an alternative agreement to the current Lithium Mining lease entered into with Barari DV Limited.

This is an indication that all is not lost once the government is ready to listen to superior arguments, alternatives, or propositions from individual Ghanaians and organizations and reconstruct a new one in the interest of Ghana and to the benefit of all Ghanaians.

One thing we like about the agreement which must be made sacrosanct is having a lithium refinery to add value to the mineral.

Currently, African countries that are mining lithium export the mineral in its raw state.

With some stance of a sort taken on the nature of the agreement, we think there is one important issue to look at and that is its legitimacy and transparency.

Regarding this, Justice Akuffo says the lithium lease is incomplete without ratification by parliament, explaining that it is a deal that has to be ratified by a named authority, and that is the Parliament of the Republic of Ghana.

Also, the Minority in Parliament wants the government to lay before the house details of the agreement with Barari DV for scrutiny and approval.

We believe this should not be a problem for the government because already, the Mining Lease is subject to ratification by Parliament by Article 268(1) of the Constitution and section 5(4) of Act 703.

The importance of lithium, including its use in the medical and electronic industries, should prompt the countrys managers to secure a good deal for its exploitation.",,Editorial,  8 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Consider-criticisms-for-better-lithium-deal-1895138
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Tourism holds potential for rapid development,"The governments plan to commit over GH400 million to provide new tourist attraction sites and renovate existing ones is in the right direction.

We even think any time it is feasible, a larger amount should be invested in the attractions because the tourism sector in the country continues to prove its potential in revenue mobilisation and job creation.

In 1993, a ministry, the Ministry of Tourism, was set up to give policy direction to tourism, and since 1996, the sector has seen significant growth.

By way of jobs, it was estimated that by the end of the year 2000, tourism would employ more than 100,000 Ghanaians in direct and indirect jobs and more in the years ahead.

This happened such that in 2015, the tourism industry had employed 393,000 people directly and indirectly in hotels, restaurants, travel trade, entertainment, recreational, tourist sites, and the like.

While speaking at the maiden launch of this years Domestic and Outbound Tourism Survey (DOTS) in Winneba, in the Central Region in April, Professor Samuel K. Annim, the Government Statistician, said among other things that revenue from tourist arrivals would create over 1.4 million jobs for the citizenry by 2027.

Even though an expert has spoken, we can conjecture that the number can rise if the right decisions and actions are taken.

On the revenue side, tourism has grown to become Ghanas third largest foreign exchange earner after gold and cocoa and efforts are on course to make it the first.

In terms of Gross Domestic Product, it is on record, for instance, that in 2021, the travel and tourism sector contributed around $3.1 billion, showing an increase of $ 1 billion over the 2020 figure of $2.1 billion.

We can see the huge job and revenue potential the tourism sector holds and the efforts being made by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture to grow the sector.

We are encouraged by the growth in domestic tourism propelled by the private sector because the 588,946 domestic arrivals recorded in 2021 rose to 937,087 in 2022.

Our appeal is that everything planned for the growth of the sector will be upheld unless changing circumstances dictate otherwise for its betterment.

The pledge by the government to continuously give the necessary support to create an enabling environment for the sector and the broader economy to flourish and make the country Africas tourism hub is a daunting task but can be made easy if the plans in place are followed.

The potential of the tourism sector is huge in the socio-economic scheme of things in the development of the country.

Imagine the sector ministry achieving its 2023 projected $3.4bn revenue from 1.2m inbound visitors and next year's target of having two million tourist arrivals, with each tourist spending an average of $3,000, which will generate $6 billion for the country.

The shift from the countrys over-reliance on commodities such as gold, timber, and cocoa being caused by tourism is a very good phenomenon.

It is a loud hailing of the fact that the country must look at every sector that has the potential to help it diversify the economy and enhance its development.",,Editorial,  7 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Tourism-holds-potential-for-rapid-development-1894385
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Treat passage of amended Act 715 with urgency,"On Sunday, the world observed one of the events on the global calendar  International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD), which falls on December 3 annually.

This observance is dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities and highlights the importance of inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities, while also celebrating their achievements and contributions to society.

Proclaimed in 1992 by the United Nations General Assembly, the observance aims to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilise support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons with disabilities (PWDs).

The day provides an opportunity for governments, organisations, and communities to come together to raise awareness, promote inclusion, and take action to improve the lives of PWDs.

It is also a day to celebrate achievements, and share stories and experiences of PWDs to raise awareness and foster empathy and understanding, while giving certain organisations and even individuals to work to improve the lives of persons with disabilities and promote inclusivity.

Like the observance of all such days, events like forums, seminars, or workshops were organised to discuss disability-related issues or challenges and solutions for inclusion that can ensure that PWDs have equal access to services and opportunities as others.

Even though this years event was globally observed on Sunday, the Ghana Federation of Disability Organisations, in collaboration with the UN Ghana and Sightsavers, organised a forum yesterday in Accra to commemorate it.

At the forum, the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations (UN), Mr Charles Abani, urged the government to expedite actions towards the passage of the amended Persons with Disability Act 2006 (Act 715) to ensure inclusivity.

The act raises impact on rights to accessibility, education, transportation, and healthcare for PWDs and the establishment and functions of the National

Council on Persons with Disability (NCPD).

We are worried that the government had to wait for the UN Resident Representative in the country to remind it of its commitment and responsibility towards PWDs in the country.

We can recall that when the Persons With Disability Act, 2006 (Act 715) was finally passed by Parliament in June 2006, many stakeholders, including PWDs, Ghana Federation of the Disabled (GFD), and some civil society organisations, hailed it.

However, after the act received Presidential assent in August 2006, there arose arguments that it had no provision on non-discrimination and the gender dimension of discrimination.

It is also on record that following the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD) and the Optional Protocol in 2012 by the Government of Ghana, the Law and Development Associates, the countrys leading multi-disciplinary law and development consultancy firm, stated in its 2013 Draft Gap Analysis Report that Act 715 is inconsistent with the UNCRPD because it has no provision on women with disability, the rights of children with disability, the inherent right to life and the right to protection and safety in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies.

We think in the face of these gaps pointed out by the experts and other challenges of PWDs in the country, it is an error that the passage of the amended Act 715 is being delayed.

We humbly appeal that the amended act be passed without further delay because Ghana can achieve disability inclusion only when a consistent and systematic approach is implemented in all areas of life in the country.

It is said that the passage will also highlight the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Ghana, and we believe this will be so particularly for those that promote an accessible and equitable world for all PWDs such as SDGs 4, 8, 10 and 11.",,Editorial,  5 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Treat-passage-of-amended-Act-715-with-urgency-1892981
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Congratulations to farmers and fishers,"Once again, Ghana has organised another Farmers Day.

We will always stand by our resolve to applaud all undertakings dedicated to motivating farmers and fishers and thereby improve agriculture in general in the country and the food system in particular.

Our resolve is based on the fact that agriculture is the backbone of the countrys economy and farmers and fishers form the pivot of the food system.

To us, the food sector is a very critical area in every economy because it is food that sustains the people to have the energy and strength to contribute their quota to national development in any way possible.

In light of this, we applaud the government for the successful organisation of the Farmers Day, with awards given to the best farmers at the district, regional and national levels.

We congratulate all the farmers and fishers in the country and extend special congratulations to award winners, particularly 57-year-old Charity Akortia, on emerging the overall best farmer at the 39th edition of the National Farmers Day, as well as her two runners-up, Theophilus Ezenrane Ackah and Kwaku Yeboah Asumah.

We are particularly elated that the overall national best farmer is a woman, even though this is not the first time a woman has been honoured at the national level.

We can recall that at the 38th awards last year, Madam Yaa Adjeley from the Western Region was declared Ghanas best female farmer and at the 37th National Farmers Day held in Cape Coast in 2021, 37 women were honoured.

Our obsession with female award winners is based on the fact there is hope in survival in any sector where females distinguish themselves because they are species that are more loyal to their vocations than men and so can be trusted for that loyalty, their consistency, and the desire to survive hard times.

We plead that as women make the effort to operate in the agriculture sector on the commercial scale, they will be given equal assistance as men are, assistance is devoid of attempts to exploit their vulnerability in any way.

Regarding the Day itself, we want to say its theme, Delivering Smart Solutions for Sustainable Food Security and Resilience, as well as speeches delivered at the national, regional, and district venues are significant.

We just want to call attention to those by Vice President, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, and the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Dr. Brian Acheampong.

Among other points, Dr. Bawumia said the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) was a smart strategy to transform the agricultural value chain of the country, and that it had helped achieve average growth of six percent from 2017 to 2022 when the figure was 2.9 percent in 2013.

Providing some statistics to illustrate increases in the production of staples like maize and rice, the Vice President noted that the PFJ had assisted over 1.5 million farmers to increase their yields and that the PFJ had demonstrated the governments unwavering commitment to transform the agriculture sector and place it on a sound footing for accelerated national development.

Coming in, Dr. Acheampong said with PFJ, Ghana would be food-secured, self-sufficient, and resilient by 2028, stressing that agriculture cannot continue to be business as usual.

We hope there are recorded plans to achieve improvements in the countrys agricultural sector that must not be abandoned by any future political administration but can only be reviewed when necessary.

As an agrarian country, Ghana must continually improve agriculture and motivate players in the sector for the countrys sustainable development.

Once again, we congratulate Farmers Day award winners and other farmers and fishers on their efforts to sustain the countrys agriculture, particularly its food system.",,Editorial,  4 December 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Congratulations-to-farmers-and-fishers-1892342
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Plan jobs for other mining community age group,"A five-year training programme to build the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of 10,000 young people in mining communities across the country is laudable.

Dubbed, the Entrepreneurship Jobs for All Programme and christened E-Jobs4All, it is one of the modules under the National Alternative Employment and Livelihood Programme (NAELP) being implemented by the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources.

What is significant about the programme is that it forms part of the governments initiative to provide decent jobs for the youth who either reside or hail from the mining regions of the country.

A critical aspect of it is that it is designed to equip the beneficiaries with the tools, skills, and insights necessary to carve, shape, and transform ideas into profitable ventures.

This dovetails into an objective of the whole programme that we deem as the overriding one  the objective to cultivate a mindset of innovation and entrepreneurship in the people.

Our innermost joy about the programme is that it is being implemented in mining communities because we expect that at the end of it all, it will help reduce illegal mining and hopefully eradicate it.

We know like licensed mining, illegal mining, commonly described as galamsey, brings financial rewards to the operators but its devastation makes it an evil venture in our country.

Currently, there is a war waged against galamsey by the government because, among other ills, it pollutes and destroys water bodies, and degrades the environment in all its shape and form, including deforestation.

In spite of the war on galamsey, people in the mining communities and even those from elsewhere continue to undertake the illegal venture.

Obeng Belinda Faamaa, Asare Kwabena Evans, and Mandela Osei-Assibey Bonsu of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China have undertaken a study titled Assessing the Factors Influencing Illegal Mining Operations: Evidence From Ghana.

The study, published in the International Journal of Economics, Commerce and Management, United Kingdom, Vol. VIII, Issue 11 in November 2020, identified some factors influencing participation in illegal mining in Ghana, namely poverty, illiteracy rate, unemployment, high dependency rate, and mining mismanagement.

If this is anything to go by, then we believe unemployment is the most serious culprit because as the saying goes, the devil finds work for idle hands.

Other studies on illegal mining regarding those involved mention statistics like over 53 per cent of the participants being illiterate or having attained up to just junior high school education, with just four per cent being tertiary education products.

This means almost 96 per cent of the operators in illegal mining are people who lack knowledge and skills that can easily make them see any alternative source of making it in life should they abandon galamsey.

Other findings say 72.7 per cent of the participants are males and the rest women.

In Ghana, women without any skills can, at least, do petty trading but by their cultural orientation, males see petty trading as feminine and so would like to be involved in masculine undertakings even if it is illegal mining in spite of the national abhorrence against it.

We therefore support the move by the government to provide decent jobs in the mining communities.

We want to suggest that since people of almost all age categories are involved in galamsey, something else must be planned for the others in addition to that being done for the youth.",,Editorial, 30 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Plan-jobs-for-other-mining-community-age-group-1890470
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Food-sufficiency can be game changer in countrys development,"We wish to call attention to a statement made by the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Bryan Acheampong, at the official opening of the National Farmers Day exhibition in Accra on Monday that the government had set a five-year target to make the country self-sufficient in food production through the implementation of the Phase Two of the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ 2) program.

Any country self-sufficient in food provides certain advantages for the citizens such as cheap food prices.

When this happens, the people spend just a small percentage of their incomes on food and can use what is left for other things like healthcare, education, decent housing, decent clothing, and entertainment, including tourism.

Currently, some Ghanaians go to bed hungry or with half-full stomachs because of their inability to afford food at all or enough of it due to its ever-soaring price.

With this in the background of our minds, we consider the ministers statement very significant because the benefits of food sufficiency in the country would mean half of the countrys problems are solved.

It is, therefore, our prayer that the expectation of the government would not be cut off and if that is actually going to be the case, then the government should uphold everything it has planned under the PFJ 2.

The PFJ 2, launched in October by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, is aimed at increasing agricultural productivity, creating jobs, and reducing food imports.

These are lofty objectives that can advance the development of the country.

As an agrarian country, Ghana must have these benefits as a given rather than things being hoped for.

We know the country produces some agricultural products and provides a lot of jobs in the agricultural sector but obviously not enough, so anything to increase productivity and jobs there must be hailed.

This is because it will take the production of sufficient food to reduce food imports by particularly stopping totally the importation of staples like rice or putting heavy duties on their imports.

Some of us wonder why the country must allow its scanty foreign exchange to be used in importing food that can be produced locally.

Imagine that in 2020 alone, over $2.7 billion was used to import food, including fish, into the country and the amount is close to the $3 billion IMF bailout the country is receiving in $600-million tranches.

The sad aspect of it all is that the bulk of the imports were cereals and cereal preparations, amounting to over $ 1 billion, followed by meat at $362 million.

A report on the 2023 Mid-Year Budget Review put together by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana, Legon, among other points, has it that Ghana remains highly dependent on imports, including staple foods like grains, meat, and poultry.

This means the country loves importing food, which in turn means there are fundamental causes that are being ignored for scapegoats in the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war.

The PFJ 2 therefore means we should abandon the excuses and work hard to achieve the governments target of food sufficiency for all the benefits it holds for the country.",,Editorial, 29 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Food-sufficiency-can-be-game-changer-in-country-rsquo-s-development-1889804
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Avoid political bias to safeguard countrys peace,"Following democratic rule in the country since 1993, various pressure groups have emerged to pursue various agendas.

These groups have their own colourisation, mostly political, and can be identified with certain political parties when one judges them by their stance and posture on certain issues.

Examples of the pressure groups are OccupyGhana; FixtheCountry; and Fixing The Country Movement.

In October this year, the Fixing The Country Movement gave notice that its members were going to picket at the office of former President John Dramani Mahama located at Labone in Accra.

The event scheduled for November 23 was over the procurement of an airbus during the former presidents administration, which the movement thinks was a shady deal.

Fortunately or unfortunately, the National Security outfit gave notice to the movement ahead of time to stop the planned picketing despite arrangements with the police.

However, on November 23, members of the Youth Wing of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), the party of which Mr Mahama is a flag bearer, went to their flag bearers office, to clean the place.

Unfortunately, the youth went to the place carrying cleaning equipment like brooms, as well as weapons like machetes, which they brandished in public.

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has joined those condemning the brandishing of machetes and other weapons at the office of former President John Dramani Mahama, stressing that no individual or group will be allowed to destabilise the peace and security of the country.

We support President Akufo-Addo and others like him in condemning what the NDC youth did.

Their action was a subtle way of telling the public that had members of Fixing The Country Movement picketed at Mr. Mahamas office, they would have caused the event to turn bloody.

We think no one should entertain such behaviour in the country as it portends chaos that can undermine the peace in the country.

In fact, just an attempt to unleash violence reduces the high peace rating given to the country and the implications are dire for its progress and development, especially in terms of foreign investment and other support.

If we all therefore value the peace in the country, which makes it a beacon of hope for tranquillity and stability in Africa, then while we condemn acts of violence, we should also condemn and warn those who give others cause to show their violent side.

In light of this, we expected President Akufo-Addo to chastise the members of Fixing The Country Movement once they have said they are committed to their position to see the Office of the Special Prosecutor handle the Airbus matter.

Also, rather than just applaud the NDC youth for cleaning his office, former President Mahama should have slammed them for carrying weapons to a clean-up exercise.

We should avoid all manner of bias, especially political, because that bias which benefits a few can cause mayhem for the country.

We should collectively ensure that there is peace in the country in the lead-up to the 2024 elections and afterwards.

That way, we believe, there will be a conducive atmosphere for whichever party wins the elections to have the peace of mind to prosecute projects and programmes to develop the country for the benefit of all the citizens.",,Editorial, 28 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Avoid-political-bias-to-safeguard-country-rsquo-s-peace-1889147
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Take antenatal care seriously!,"The celebration of World Prematurity Day annually on November 17 to raise awareness of preterm or premature birth means the reproductive problem is not anything to gloss over.

The condition is said to cause a heavy burden of death and disability, psychological stress, and pain and suffering to parents, families, communities, and nations at large.

In fact, it is known to be the leading cause of neonatal deaths locally and worldwide.

It is sad to learn that 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide and one million of them do not survive.

In Ghana, about 200,000 babies are annually born prematurely, and about 50 per cent of babies delivered annually at the maternity unit of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) are preterm.

Going by the global calculations, it means about seven per cent of these children die and among them could be the children some parents had longed for.

They can also be the only birth a couple would have in a lifetime and even if the scenarios are different, the death of a baby is generally a bitter experience for the couple, their extended families and neighbours.

The cost incurred by parents and, sometimes loved ones, as well as health facilities (that is, the government for that matter) in the hope of ensuring the childs survival cannot be ignored either.

Among superstitious societies, particularly in the under-developed world, preterm children are seen as evil and so couples giving birth to such babies suffer the additional burden of being deemed accursed.

Thanks to medical science such myths have been unravelled to a large extent as doctors say preterm births are mostly due to certain pregnancy-related complications, which are expertly handled by medical professionals.

To this end, we encourage expectant mothers to adhere to all the pieces of advice given by the hospitals and clinics.

For instance, paediatricians advise expectant mothers to seek early antenatal care to help reduce the risks of delivering preterm babies and thus improve the chances of the survival of their babies.

It is unfortunate to hear that even though antenatal care is free under the countrys National Health Insurance Scheme, some pregnant women employ all manner of excuses to avoid going for that care.

We think as others do that children are the hope of the continuous survival of every society and so efforts by the government, the hospitals and their partners like Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Soldiers, an advocacy organisation and Ghandour Cosmetics Limited, both providing support for parents of preterm babies and the babies, must not be allowed to go to waste.

Maybe, this is the time for the National Commission for Civic Education to organise special programmes in the rural and peri-urban communities to stress the need to discard superstitions associated with premature birth and the importance of expectant mothers giving special attention to antenatal care.

We agree that the government should provide the necessary facilities for the care of preterm babies, yet we also think if women would take seriously all the necessary reproduction-related advice given to them, the pressure on the government in that area would ease.

Besides, the incidence of preterm births would reduce, and as that happens, couples, families and their communities, as well as the government would be saved from all the associated unpleasantness, including the loss of talents for national development.",,Editorial, 27 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Take-antenatal-care-seriously-1888487
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Scrap irrelevant or harsh legislation policies!!,"Yesterday, we published two stories that were similar in their demands  amendment of certain constitutional provisions and policies.

In the first story on page 10, Nana Soglo Alloh IV, Otekple of Likpe and President of the Likpe Traditional Council has called for the amendment of Article 95 Clause 1 and Article 100 Clause 1in the 1992 Constitution ahead of the 2024 general election, explaining that the two articles contradicted each other.

According to him, Article 95 clause 1 says there shall be a Speaker of Parliament, who shall be elected by the members of Parliament (MPs), and Article 100 clause1states that before an MP takes his seat in Parliament, he must be sworn in by the Speaker.

In the face of this, he thinks the current practice where MPs elect the Speaker before he or she swears them in is unconstitutional or inappropriate and so wants the Chief Justice to first swear in the MPs to give them the legitimacy to elect the Speaker.

We are inclined to support the view of the noble chief but would like to stop short of further comments except to appeal to constitutional experts to give the suggestion particular attention.

We can see that if that suggestion has any basis, then one day someone or a group can question the authority or legitimacy of the Speaker.

In the second story on page 13, the Ghana Institute of Freight Forwarders (GIFF) is calling for a review of some policies and legislation hampering smooth business operations at the countrys ports of entry.

The GIFF argues, for instance, that the imposition of a Reference Price List (RPL) for the valuation of goods at the ports by the Board of Directors of the Ghana Revenue Authority contradicts international trade agreements, particularly those under the Trade Facilitation Agreement put in place by the World Trade Organisation.

The GIFF goes further to point out that Sections 67 and 68 of the Customs Act 2015 (Act 891) make it illegal to create a certain minimum value or RPL for valuation purposes.

It is more worrying to learn that the Exemptions Act, 2022 (Act 1083) has inadvertently created obstacles in the clearance process, affecting not only private enterprises but also hindering even the clearance of government cargoes at the ports.

We have taken interest in these two stories because of their importance to peace and stability as well as the economic well-being of business people, consumers, and the country as a whole.

We think if circumstances have exposed the irrelevance of such legislation and policies, the authorities must give urgent attention to calls for a second look at them, amend them, and bring in replacements that can meet the exigencies of the time.

Let us chip in that there is a need for the government to listen to other calls for the amendment of constitutional provisions and policies that are not the subjects of our chosen stories but have issues to deal with.

One of such provision is Article 71 of the 1992 Constitution as it over-rewards certain groups of people for their services to the country.

Whether constitutional provisions or policies, once the people see them as undermining their very existence and likely to cause crises in the future, they must be scrapped or amended to forestall chaos.

Why should we continue to have constitutional provisions and policies that undermine the socio-economic development of the people?

Let us amend or completely replace them.",,Editorial, 24 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Scrap-irrelevant-or-harsh-legislation-policies-1887017
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Safeguard traffic and streetlights,"During a multi-stakeholder engagement on non-functioning traffic and street lights organised in Accra on Tuesday, it came out that 20 traffic controllers and 31 cables had been either stolen or vandalised by criminals in the countrys capital alone.

The situation should worry all Ghanaians because the traffic controllers and street lights form part of road furniture meant to ensure safety to preserve both life and property and prevent some unnecessary costs.

This means their absence poses safety challenges that must be fixed in good time to prevent road crashes and related matters.

Already, there are certain communities calling for such road safety facilities and are facing difficulty having them because of the countrys financial constraints.

Imagine that the price of just one controller, depending on its capacity, can range from GH80,000 to GH180,000 and that the cost of replacement is equivalent to undertaking a new installation.

It is clear that the Ministry of Roads and Highways and relevant agencies and departments like the National Road Safety Authority and Department of Urban Roads should collaborate particularly with the police to find ways to arrest the national wreckers who steal or vandalise road furniture.

It is not out of place to appeal to the general public to help though but the problem is beyond ordinary members of the public, particularly for the fact that criminals are involved and can harm defenseless people.

Besides, sometimes members of the public who provide information to security services to go after criminals are later exposed and their lives put at risk.

Therefore, the police must be the principal actors in helping to protect road furniture, including traffic controllers and traffic lights.

We are happy that there is a law that offenders can be made to face.

Our worry, though, is that sometimes the public gets the impression that the state fails to make nation wreckers face the full rigours of the law.

Therefore, we are appealing that henceforth everything must be done to hand not only those stealing or vandalising road furniture but other criminals harsh sentences or heavy fines that can serve as true deterrence to others.

It is probable that good members of the public would take a cue from that and begin to help the police and other security agencies to stamp out all manner of crime.

But while we say this, we wish to acknowledge the fact that the carelessness of some drivers and motorcycle riders causes them to crash into traffic and street lights and render them non-functional.

Sometimes, it becomes very difficult to understand the logic of certain drivers who realise their unreasonable behaviour on the road only when they cannot escape arrest or have rendered themselves unable to leave the scene of the avoidable accidents they have caused.

It seems the laws that deal with driving offences in the country are not deterrent enough, so they need a second look and this must be done to check driver misbehaviour in the country.

Matters regarding road safety must be the concern of all because lack of such safety can lead to injuries, loss of lives and property as well as productivity, not to mention the cost to the state, individuals, and families.",,Editorial, 23 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Safeguard-traffic-and-streetlights-1886339
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Its possible to become Open Defecation Free (ODF) society,"Ghana on Sunday joined the world to mark World Toilet Day, a day set aside by the World Toilet Organisation (WTO), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to address the need to have proper access to toilets and the significance of having good hygiene in the daily lifestyle globally.

On November 19, every year, World Toilet Day is observed to create conversations related to good sanitation and how we all can do our bit in improving the state of affairs.

This has gone on ever since World Toilet Day became a major event in 2010 when the United Nations declared a human right to water and sanitation as a basic human right.

Indeed, Ghana commemorated the day with a call on all to help demystify discussions around toilets.

Under the theme: Accelerating change through strategic partnership: Every contribution counts the day was climaxed with a durbar at Mpoase in the Ablekuma West Municipality of the Greater Accra Region.

Speaking at the durbar, the Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, Dr. Freda Akosua Prempeh, said the need to demystify discussions around toilets had become imperative now than ever if the country was to achieve its goal of an Open Defecation Free (ODF) society.

She said breaking the myth surrounding toilets would not only create room for people to talk about something natural and unavoidable but would also help people to appreciate the need to own their toilet facilities.

Dr. Prempeh explained that World Toilet Day was to among other things break the taboo around toilets and to raise awareness of the daily struggles of the over 2.5 billion people around the world in accessing basic services like toilet facilities.

The government, she emphasised was working to improve sanitation with the provision of household toilets as a key component of everything it was.

The minister pointed out that even though more than 40,000 household toilets had been provided under the GAMA project, much more remained to be done.

She said for the country to win the fight against Open Defecation (OD) all stakeholders, including the citizenry must adopt a change in attitude.

The Ghanaian Times cannot disagree that sanitation, particularly open defecation has been a very difficult public health condition in the country. As a matter of fact, the government continues to spend a lot of resources on sanitation nationwide but the situation continues to pose a challenge.

As said earlier, sanitation is a basic human right. Therefore, the need for good sanitation is fundamental but it is high time that we understood that we owe it as a responsibility to contribute towards environmental cleanliness.

We are all aware that open defecation and bad hygiene can lead to severe illnesses which would eventually increase the health bill of the country.

Besides, the standard of living can drop depending on access to proper toilets, and in rural areas, open defecation and the absence of proper sanitation facilities can lead to the spread of diseases in the communities.

We believe that when we put all hands on deck and consciously observe environmental cleanliness, it is possible to achieve an open defecation-free society.",,Editorial, 22 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-It-rsquo-s-possible-to-become-Open-Defecation-Free-ODF-society-1885679
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: YEA artisanal jobs creation way to go!,"In line with its mandate to create jobs for the youth of the country, the Youth Employment Agency (YEA) has announced the opening of an employment portal under its Artisanal Trades and Vocation Module to create sustainable jobs for the teeming unemployed youth.

The Agency envisions to employ a minimum of 20,000 artisans under the programme over two years. This is commendable and if properly executed, the benefits thereof would be enormous.

According to the Agency, the module is aimed at addressing the age-old youth unemployment which has been classified as a ticking national security threat.

It is important to indicate that this is not the only employment module that the agency is pursuing. Some of the other modules include Youth in Trades and Vocation model, Brick moulding and laying with BRRI, Business Support Programme, and Youth in Agric amongst others.

The model, the agency said, would be run in collaboration with a multi-industry private sector player that was duly registered and licensed in Ghana, under a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement.

The Ghanaian Times commends the YEA for this initiative to offer sustainable jobs to would-be-lucky 20,000 young men and women and ultimately offer them the opportunity to earn incomes to contribute meaningfully to national development.

The nation has over the years struggled to create jobs for the youth and unemployment continues to be a major challenge for the country. It is against this backdrop that we agree with those who argue that the rippling effect on these initiatives would be enormous as it would not only improve the lives of the would-be beneficiaries but also their dependants, families, and communities.

While commending the YEA, we would encourage it to expand its scope to capture much more unemployed youth in areas that are not included in the categories earmarked for the programme.

This category of the unemployed population is largely graduates, professionals like teachers, and nurses whose services and demands remain crucial to the human development of the country.

We make this proposal because for example, in April this year, a group of unemployed physician assistants picketed at the Ministry of Health and demanded that they be posted after completing their studies in 2018 and 2020 respectively. Their colleague teacher trainees and nurses have also in the past expressed the same frustration of joblessness.

Per the International Labour Organisations report on Ghana for 2022, graduate unemployment stood at 12 percent with only five percent securing jobs a year after their mandatory national service.

We hope that these initiatives will be embraced by the youth so that they can yield the desired results. This is a major step forward in the nations quest to create jobs for the citizenry. Other agencies must emulate YEA to create decent jobs for all.

These innovations are commendable and hope that the YEA and other agencies that are in the business of job creation will get the full support of the government and all stakeholders so that their efforts will not be in vain.",,Editorial, 21 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-YEA-artisanal-jobs-creation-way-to-go-1885004
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fare Thee Well, Former First Lady, Theresa Kufuor!!","Death, it is said, is painful; however, death taking a precious jewel like the former First Lady, Theresa Kufuor is more painful.

Tomorrow, the late Theresa Kufuor would be laid to rest in Kumasi, after elaborate final funeral rites at the Heroes Park; part of which began yesterday in Accra.

The former First Lady died at home at Peduase on October 1 at age 87.

The funeral in Accra attracted local and international dignitaries.

Notable among the personalities present at the forecourt of the State House to pay their respect to the former First Lady, were the Vice President, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, and the Second Lady, Mrs Samira Bawumia, and former President John Mahama and his spouse, Mrs Lordina Mahama.

Also in attendance were the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, and Chief Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo.

Other mourners included former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo; Vice President of Liberia, Jewel Taylor; the Chief of Staff, Akosua Frema Osei-Opare; Ministers of State, Members of Parliament, the clergy, traditional rulers, heads of corporate organisations amongst others.

As reported by our correspondents, the casket containing the remains of the late Mrs. Kufuor was opened for filing past before a Catholic funeral mass was held to commence the funeral rites.

Glowing tributes were then said in her memory, wreaths were also laid on behalf of the state, Former President Kufuor, children, the family, the church, and traditional rulers.

Indeed, the array of mourners who attended the funeral underscores how she was loved not only by Ghanaians but by others from abroad.

The Ghanaian Times recalls that, as a First Lady, she was full of compassion and displayed a lot of humility. No wonder, she won the hearts of many Ghanaians when she performed her duties as the First Lady of Ghana.

It is often said that some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them. In the case of the former First Lady, we would say that she was born great and also went ahead to achieve more greatness through her remarkable performance as a First Lady.

Space would not allow us to enumerate her numerous achievements but the fact is we all appreciated the work she did for mother Ghana. She showed everyone what true greatness means.

Indeed, she has paid her dues and though her demise was painful, we are grateful to God that her life was impactful and are grateful she left behind legacies we can remember forever.

Her loving memory will no doubt forever remain a monument in our hearts. Death is painful; however, death taking an important personality away is more painful.

We thank the former First Lady for a life well spent and wish her eternal rest.

Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Need to intensify diabetes campaign,"Ghana on Wednesday, joined the world to mark World Diabetes Day (WDD), which was created in 1991 by the International Diabetic Federation (IDF) and the World Health Organisation in response to growing concerns about the escalating health threat posed by diabetes.

World Diabetes Day became an official United Nations Day in 2006 with the passage of United Nations Resolution 61/225 and marked every year on November 14, which is the birthday of Sir Frederick Banting, who co-discovered insulin along with Charles Best in 1922.

The global campaign draws attention to issues of paramount importance to the diabetes world and keeps diabetes firmly in the public and political spotlight.

It is estimated that one in 10 adults worldwide have diabetes. Over 90 percent have Type 2 diabetes. Close to half are not yet diagnosed. In many cases, Type 2 diabetes and its complications can be delayed or prevented by adopting and maintaining healthy habits.

In Ghana, approximately 7.5 percent of the adult population is said to have Type 2 diabetes with fears that a lot more people may have the condition but are unaware of it.

According to the Ghana Health Service (GHS), an average of 200,000 cases of diabetes is recorded in Ghana annually with about 10 percent of the population estimated to live with the disease.

In order to draw attention to these alarming figures across the world, World Diabetes Day kept its campaign focused on diabetes as a critical global health issue.

Similarly in Ghana, the GHS has been engaged in activities to draw attention to the disease that has become a public health issue.

One of such activity is the launch of a national guideline for the management of diabetes, which remains a leading cause of death in the country.

The guideline, which is the first of its kind, is to bridge gaps in diabetes management and ensure standardisation while improving clinical and public knowledge of the disease to reduce its prevalence, complications, and associated deaths.

Launching the guideline to coincide with World Diabetes Day yesterday, the Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, said the development of the guideline was significant to reduce diabetes prevalence and improve healthcare for all.

This document represents a major pillar in the implementation of NCD strategy specifically addressing the burden of diabetes in Ghana and the achievement of the Universal Health coverage 2030 agenda.

The national diabetes guidelines will serve as a roadmap for healthcare professionals, outlining best practices and evidence-based approaches to the management of diabetes and it is expected to not only improve the quality of care but also empower patients to take control of their health and lead fulfilling lives, he indicated.

The Ghanaian Times commends the Ministry of Health and the GHS for their commitment in seeking innovative ways to reduce exposure to risk factors that contribute to diabetes and the non-communicable disease (NCDs) burden in the country.

What is important now is for the citizenry to embrace the campaign and collaborate with health officials to ensure that the real impact of these guidelines would be felt in communities and healthcare facilities, where individuals living with diabetes and those at risk will benefit from the best practices outlined in the guidelines.

We are all aware of the implications of diabetes on social and national development and cannot pretend that the country is being affected negatively.

We, therefore, entreat the public to adopt healthy lifestyles to improve their health and reduce vulnerabilities to diabetes",,Editorial, 16 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Need-to-intensify-diabetes-campaign-1882286
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: National policy on religion timely,"Ghana is regarded as a secular state and religious tolerance is widely practised within the nation many Ghanaians continue to be tolerant of other beliefs and practices thanks to the laws embedded in its constitution which forbids religious discrimination.

The constitution prohibits religious discrimination, stipulates individuals are free to profess and practice their religion and does not designate a state religion.

Historically, through schools, students with different backgrounds attend religious tolerant schools and communities practice interfaith dialogue and live in harmony.

As a matter of fact, there have been very minimal religious conflicts in the country as compared with other nations around the world. The benefits of religious tolerance are enormous as it leads to peaceful co-existence and development.

Many countries around the world have suffered wars that have led to the destruction of their countries. Thankfully, we have been spared religious conflicts and intolerance.

It is for this reason that the Ghanaian Times welcomes the efforts by the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs in pushing for a national policy on religion to address the challenges and to promote opportunities associated with the coexistence of different faiths and beliefs in the country.

The Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Stephen Asamoah Boateng who disclosed this at a news conference in Accra yesterday, said a proposed policy, is being drafted with support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), to provide a framework for the protection and promotion of the rights and freedoms of all religious groups, as well as prevent and resolve conflicts that may arise from religious differences.

Mr. Boateng noted that the practice of religion had given rise to some social challenges including weak enforcement and limited adherence to laws governing the conduct and practice of religion, religious fanaticism, money laundering, false indoctrination, inter and intra-faith disputes, and incitement to gender-based violence.

He said, that while the ministry appreciates and commends the works of some religious leaders, there was the need to take proactive measures to engineer the necessary reforms needed for addressing the worrying issues that had sprung up.

While commending the Ministry for the forward looking policy, we must emphasise that there are vast benefits to be derived from religious tolerance in Ghana.

In fact, the establishment and strengthening of religious tolerance, as well as mutual respect, friendship, and mutual cooperation can significantly bring positive changes among many communities made of people with different faith and belief systems to help unify our people culturally and politically.

We think that the national policy initiative by the Chieftaincy Ministry is not only timely but very necessary at this moment and out to receive the support of all to ensure its smooth implementation.

With a universal policy that is acceptable to all, we are certain that it would help improve religious relations and tolerance among Ghanaians as well as enhance our democracy, peace, political and social stability in the country.

We add our voice to the call on religious leaders, chiefs, and politicians to partner with the Chieftaincy Ministry to fine-tune the proposed national policy that would promote religious harmony, diversity, and tolerance in the country.

There is no better time than now to have and implement such an important national policy.",,Editorial, 15 November 2023,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-National-policy-on-religion-timely-1881581
