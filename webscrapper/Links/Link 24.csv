Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.

Youre better than a pack of cooked rice; dont let politicians use you for violence  GBA to youth,"The Ghana Bar Association (GBA) has expressed concern about the pockets of violent incidents recently recorded during some electoral processes towards the main election in December.


The GBA warns that such incidents are not a positive indication as the country approaches the general election.


Yaw Acheampong Boafo, President of the GBA, urged the youth to remain purposeful and resist being used by politicians as instruments of violence. 


He encouraged them to engage in activities that would improve their lives and the lives of their families rather than put them in danger.


Mr Boafo made these remarks at the remembrance service for the Martyrs of the Rule of Law, held at the Cavalry Baptist Church on Sunday, June 30.




“To the youth who are invariably exploited and manipulated by some political actors, I urge you to be purposely in life. Channel your energy into meaningful ventures and not be misled by unscrupulous politicians to engage in acts that destabilise our nation.”


“I dare say, you’re worth more than some few Ghana Cedis and a pack of cooked rice,” he said. 


He also called on Ghanaians to safeguard the country's democratic achievements and promote the economic well-being of all citizens.


“The 2024 General election is a little over five months away. It is not in doubt that the stakes are even higher.”




“We cannot afford to deal with similar acts of threats, violence, intimidation and vigilantism which can affect the peace and stability of Ghana and our general quest to consolidate our democratic gains and accelerate our economic development,” he added.

Election 2024: NDC leadership appears wobbly  Adu Asare,"A former National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament (MP) for the Adentan constituency, Kwadwo Adu Asare, has voiced concerns about the current state of the party as the December elections draw near.


Mr Adu Asare emphasised that he anticipates a higher level of enthusiasm from the party, especially in this critical year of campaigning.


His comments reflect a desire for more vigour and momentum within the NDC's efforts.


In an interview with Citi FM on Friday, June 28, Mr Adu Asare responded to inquiries about the party's performance. He highlighted areas where the party fell short of his expectations.


Despite his concerns, Mr Adu Asare remains hopeful. He expressed optimism that the situation is likely to improve as the elections approach.




“Sometimes your party leadership has a way of demonstrating the strength of the organisation very well. I think that there are some wobbly aspects of it but hopefully, with time they get better… I personally have a certain view vis-a-vis what used to exist before especially in an election year and all of that,” he stated.


He further expressed his anticipation for more vigour, especially considering the experiences of 2020, given his position at the nerve centre of the party.


“I expect a bit of zest, especially coming from the experiences of 2020 because some of us [were] at the nerve centre,” he added.

"Bawumias choice of Opoku Prempeh not surprising, makes political sense  Osae-Kwapong","Political analyst and research fellow at the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Dr John Osae-Kwapong, has endorsed the proposal of Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, also known as NAPO, as Dr Mahamudu Bawumia's running mate, describing it as a prudent decision.


In an interview with Channel One TV on Saturday, June 29, Dr Osae-Kwapong expressed the view that the selection of Dr Opoku Prempeh was not unexpected, considering the widespread support for his candidacy from influential quarters.


Dr Osae-Kwapong emphasised that both Dr Bawumia and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) leadership are well aware of the capabilities and contributions of the Member of Parliament for Manhyia South. 


He highlighted the strategic advantages that Dr Opoku Prempeh brings to the political landscape, citing his track record and influence within the party.


“After some time, I got the impression that there were active attempts by certain key voices to highlight the fact that he [NAPO] would be a strong candidate to partner with Bawumia in the upcoming elections, so I wasn’t particularly surprised when the announcement was made that his name was submitted to NEC for consideration.




“Every presidential candidate selects their running mate, I believe, being guided by two key things; the political dividends that they believe the candidate can bring to their campaign and then also the governance dividends.”


“When you put everything together, the choice makes sense and I can also see that this is the choice that the vice president thinks is a choice that will help him make a case for a Bawumia presidency and if he wins, this is a choice that can help him govern,” Dr Osae-Kwapong added.

Mr Afenyo-Markin highlighted the confidence within the majority caucus regarding Dr Opoku Prempeh's capabilities and contributions, indicating a unified stance as they prepare for the upcoming political contest.


“Yes, the leader of our party and flagbearer met with the leadership of Parliament and had an extensive engagement with us, regarding the way forward for the party going into the 2024 elections.


“And then, the conclusion was that our respected colleague, Dr Mathew Opoku-Prempeh, is his choice for running mate. And that is normally the practice, and out of respect, the caucus would have to be informed and engaged about the decision.""


“After, I proceeded and engaged the caucus, and so far, the feedback has been positive. That the generality of the caucus members is in support of his choice. What is it is that for it to become official or confirmed, there’s going to be a national council meeting,"" he stated.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

Moroccan security chief visits France to bolster bilateral cooperation,"At the official invitation of French security services, Abdellatif Hammouchi, Director-General of National Security (DGSN) and Territorial Surveillance (DGST) of Morocco, paid a working visit to France. 


During his visit, he held talks with counterparts in the National Police, Internal Security, and External Security in France.





The discussions focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation in various security fields of mutual interest, according to a statement from the DGSN-DGST Cluster. 


From June 26-28, Hammouchi held a series of meetings with Céline Berthon, Director-General of Internal Security, and Nicolas Lerner, Director-General of External Security of France. 


They explored ways to enhance cooperation in combating terrorism and organised crime and discussed promoting coordination and exchange of intelligence and operational data on threats posed by extremist organizations and transnational crime networks.







Hammouchi was accompanied by a significant security delegation from the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance. 


He also met with Fréderic Veaux, Director-General of the French National Police, for intensive discussions on advanced cooperation and coordination, especially in developing proactive risk assessment mechanisms and data exchange for securing the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.


In recognition of the exemplary Morocco-France cooperation in various security areas, Hammouchi was awarded the Gold Medal of Honour by the French National Police for his efforts to consolidate and develop joint security cooperation.





The visit provided an opportunity for both sides to discuss further strengthening bilateral cooperation to combat transnational crime, including drug smuggling, illegal migration networks, and human trafficking.




Practical mechanisms for cooperation in joint security measures and operations were also discussed.


This visit underscores the importance of boosting bilateral security cooperation between Morocco and France, which share numerous action and coordination programs and face common security challenges.


It reflects the commitment of the General Directorate of National Security and the General Directorate of Territorial Surveillance to international security cooperation in combating terrorist and criminal threats at regional and international levels.

"Robbers shoot pastor, bolt with his car and phones at Awutu Papaase","Awutu Papaase District Pastor of the Church of Pentecost in the Central Region, Samuel Koblah Narh, has been shot in his home in the district.


Robbers made away with his Toyota RAV4 car with the registration GW 545-22 and his mobile phones.


Police investigations suggest that armed robbers hid in front of his home waiting for an opportunity to enter his home.





A few hours later when the pastor was entering his home from an evening service, the robbers entered his house when his son opened the main gates.


Immediately, the robbers began to open fire to scare and frighten the family while demanding the keys to his vehicle.




The thieves made away with the car which had the pastor's mobile phones.


In an interview with Adom News, a church elder, Godfred Viglo, revealed that one of the stray bullets hit the pastor in the shoulder.


He said Pastor Koblah was initially rushed to Winneba Trauma and Specialist Hospital for first aid and subsequently transferred to Church of Pentecost Hospital Madina for treatment.


Mr Viglo appealed to Ghanaians and the Ghana Police Service to help arrest the suspects and retrieve the pastor's Toyota RAV4.

Tricycle rider jailed 12 years for defiling 10-year-old girl,"A 27-year-old tricycle operator, Godfred Ofosu Appiah, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison in hard labour by the Ashanti Circuit Court at Old Tafo for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.


The defilement incident occurred in May 2024 at Sarfo near Asonomanso in the Ashanti region while the victim's father, Kandi Inusah, was away in the Western North region.


The victim's parents travel regularly, leaving their daughter in the care of the convict, a tenant who lived rent-free in their home for three months.


Godfred Appiah, driven by lust, sent his wife on an errand and then sexually assaulted the girl in an unfinished room, threatening her to keep silent about the incident.The victim's mother discovered her daughter was bleeding in the vagina, and upon questioning, was informed of the sexual assault by Godfred.


The mother reported the incident to the Mamponteng police, and a medical report confirmed defilement.




Godfred was taken into custody where he confessed to the crime in both his caution and charge statements, with an independent witness present. He was subsequently brought before the court to face charges.


The accused admitted to the crime in an open court.


In court, Godfred admitted to the charge of defilement and pleaded guilty to sexual relations with a minor.


“No one forced me or promised me to plead guilty for a lenient sentence,” he told Presiding Judge Festus Fovi Nukunu.




The judge then asked if he was of sound mind when he committed the crime and if he had any mental health issues, to which Godfred responded, “No. I am sound. It is the devil that made me do it.”


The court found the accused guilty based on his voluntary admission of guilt, and his understanding of the charges.


Godfred begged for leniency, promising not to reoffend. However, the prosecutor, Inspector Alfred Aruk, emphasised that the accused had deliberately committed the crime despite being married, and argued for a harsher sentence to serve as a deterrent to others who might consider similar actions.


The court considered the sentencing guidelines for defilement, which range from 7 to 25 years. Taking into account that the accused is a first-time offender and did not waste the court's time, the judge mitigated the sentence.




However, given the young age of the victim and the premeditated nature of the crime, the judge handed down a 12-year prison sentence in hard labour, aiming to serve as a deterrent.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Menuso residents appeal for telephone network connectivity,"Residents of Menuso, a farming community in the Kadjebi District of the Oti Region, have appealed to mobile communications companies and the government to link them to the mobile network connectivity highway.


They said the border community needs vital facilities to make communication easy, especially in times of terrorist attacks.


They said the continued absence of the facility in the community put them at risk.


They said they have to climb trees and anthills in search of a network to make or receive calls when the need arises and that this deprived them of accessing vital information on time and derailed their business efforts.


The appeal was through Mr Baba Abdul Rahman, a former Assemblyman for Menuso Electoral Area at a community meeting with the Police and Ghana Immigration Service Personnel from the Menuso Border Post.




Mr Smith Tagba, Headman for Agbo Kordzi supported the call and said now that terrorist attacks in the sub-region are increasingly becoming a worrying trend, reporting attacks on the border community to the security agencies would be difficult because of the poor network connectivity.


He said the community members are living in fear and panic due to the absence of the facility in the town.


Mr Tagba, also a former Assemblyman for the area, said all attempts to bring authorities to act on the issue have failed.


He thus renewed their appeal for the installation of a mast as any attack on the community would be disastrous.

"Robbers shoot pastor, bolt with his car and phones at Awutu Papaase","Awutu Papaase District Pastor of the Church of Pentecost in the Central Region, Samuel Koblah Narh, has been shot in his home in the district.


Robbers made away with his Toyota RAV4 car with the registration GW 545-22 and his mobile phones.


Police investigations suggest that armed robbers hid in front of his home waiting for an opportunity to enter his home.





A few hours later when the pastor was entering his home from an evening service, the robbers entered his house when his son opened the main gates.


Immediately, the robbers began to open fire to scare and frighten the family while demanding the keys to his vehicle.




The thieves made away with the car which had the pastor's mobile phones.


In an interview with Adom News, a church elder, Godfred Viglo, revealed that one of the stray bullets hit the pastor in the shoulder.


He said Pastor Koblah was initially rushed to Winneba Trauma and Specialist Hospital for first aid and subsequently transferred to Church of Pentecost Hospital Madina for treatment.


Mr Viglo appealed to Ghanaians and the Ghana Police Service to help arrest the suspects and retrieve the pastor's Toyota RAV4.

The conundrum of data privacy protection law,"In 2022, the World Bank announced that Ghana’s digital sector has been growing on average by 19% between 2014 to 2020. This remarkable growth has seen the country surpass many of its African counterparts and is positioning it as a leader in the African digital landscape. However, as the country’s digital economy has expanded, so need to protect its citizen's data in an increasingly borderless cyber world become more pressing.


Like many other nations, Ghana finds itself caught between rapidly evolving technology and complex regulatory frameworks. For example, although the transfer and processing of data often occur irrespective of national boundaries, the legal systems to regulate them are usually based on territorial jurisdictions. This is because the global approach to data protection and privacy laws varies widely. Europe has taken steps towards a unified approach with the EU Data Protection Directive, although implementation varies significantly among its 27 member states.


Africa, in contrast, presents a patchwork of regulations. Some African countries, like Ghana with its Data Protection Act, 2012, have made significant strides, yet regulations differ greatly across the continent. Beyond Africa and Europe, countries like Australia, India, and China have their own distinct regulations, creating a complex global mix of data protection laws. This mismatch poses significant challenges for businesses that seek to expand beyond the confines of their local borders.


Resultingly, when Ghanaian businesses extend their services to regions like Europe or North America, they often face a steep learning curve in data handling processes. On the flip side, this situation is even more complex for multinational corporations operating in Ghana. They must navigate not only local laws but also a myriad of international regulations. This challenge is particularly acute for technology providers, especially telecommunications companies.


Global tech companies with a presence in Ghana's telecommunications infrastructure, like Huawei, exemplify this challenge by producing equipment that complies with Ghanaian law while also meeting the diverse international standards which are constantly evolving.




Nonetheless, a coordinated international approach to data protection and cybersecurity principles would greatly benefit global commerce and innovation. Such an approach could potentially see countries around the world implement global standards that ease the compliance burden on both local companies expanding abroad and international companies operating within a country.


As Ghana continues to position itself as a tech hub for West Africa, the need for clear, internationally aligned data protection standards becomes increasingly urgent. This is a complex challenge, but it offers an opportunity for Ghana to lead the way in shaping Africa's digital future.


The goal for Ghana is to create an environment where local innovations can thrive globally while ensuring the privacy of its citizens. Striking this delicate balance will be crucial as Ghana navigates the complex world of international data protection and seeks to establish itself as a leader in Africa's digital economy.

"AI can beat university students, study suggests","University exams taken by fake students using artificial intelligence beat those by real students and usually went undetected by markers, in a limited study.


University of Reading researchers created 33 fictitious students and used the AI tool ChatGPT to generate answers to module exams for an undergraduate psychology degree at the institution.


They said the AI students' results were half a grade boundary higher on average than those of their real-life counterparts.


And the AI essays ""verged on being undetectable"", with 94% not raising concerns with markers.


The 6% detection rate is likely to be an overestimate, according to the study, published in the journal Plos One.




""This is particularly worrying as AI submissions robustly gained higher grades than real student submissions,"" it said. 


""Thus, students could cheat undetected using AI - and in doing so, attain a better grade then those who did not cheat.""





Associate Prof Peter Scarfe and Prof Etienne Roesch, who led the study, said their findings should be a ""wake-up call"" for educators around the world.


Dr Scarfe said: ""Many institutions have moved away from traditional exams to make assessment more inclusive.




""Our research shows it is of international importance to understand how AI will affect the integrity of educational assessments.


""We won’t necessarily go back fully to handwritten exams - but the global education sector will need to evolve in the face of AI.""





'Abstract reasoning'


In the study, fake exam answers and essays were submitted for first-, second- and third-year modules, without the knowledge of those marking them.


The scores by the AI students beat those achieved by the real undergraduates in the first two years.




But the humans scored better in the third-year exams - which ""is consistent with the notion that current AI struggles with more abstract reasoning"", the researchers said.


And theirs was the largest and most robust blind study of its kind to date.


Academics have raised concerns about the influence of AI in education, with Glasgow University recently reintroducing in-person exams for one course.


And earlier this year, the Guardian reported, a study had found most undergraduates used artificial-intelligence programs to help with their essays - but just 5% admitted pasting unedited AI-generated text into their assessments.

Huawei Ghana begins campus recruitment program,"Huawei Ghana, as part of its talent development initiative, has begun the 2024 edition of its annual campus recruitment program aimed at connecting excellent ICT talents to industry for national service and subsequently career opportunities.


The program, which is themed “Beyond Limits”, seeks to recruit 200 graduates across 10 universities in the country, after which the top 80 will be selected to undergo national service with the company.


Mr Jay Xi, Human Resource Director, Huawei Ghana


The Human Resource Director of Huawei Ghana, Mr. Jay Xi, emphasized that the company’s contribution to Ghana’s digital transformation agenda goes beyond infrastructure development to the nurturing of local talent.


According to him, “Investing in talent is as important as investing in business, as human capital is the driving force behind innovation and progress”. 


This philosophy, he said, has guided the company’s approach to academia partnerships, where it strives to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to remain relevant and competitive in the digital age.




He, therefore, urged the students to cultivate a spirit of determination and a willingness to step outside their comfort zones, to break free from all limitations, as the program's theme suggests.





During these campus visits, students will not only learn about Huawei and its diverse career paths but also have the opportunity to interact with staff from the company and undergo aptitude tests.


Shortlisted students will be interviewed at a later date with individuals who pass the interview process offered National service opportunities. 


As part of the talent modelling process, designated mentors will be assigned to each beneficiary to ensure their smooth transition from school to the workplace with exceptional candidates offered employment after the national service period.




Huawei, over the past few years, has invested in Ghana’s education sector through the training of over 20,000 ICT professionals across the top 16 universities in the country under its ICT academy initiative. 


The company, under its Annual ICT Job Fair program, Internships and National Service opportunities, has helped connect over 700 graduate students in STEM to readily available jobs in partnership with the government of Ghana.


Huawei as the leading provider of information communication technologies and smart devices is committed to creating pathways that connect skilled talent to available opportunities in the ICT industry.

Wife accused of poisoning husband by adding weed killer to his Mountain Dew,"A 47-year-old woman who allegedly poisoned her husband by spiking his Mountain Dew has admitted she probably ""should have just divorced"" him instead.


As reported by Law and Crime, Missouri woman Michelle Y. Peters has been charged with one count of first-degree domestic assault and one count of armed criminal action after she put Round Up in her husband's drink because he was ""not appreciative"" of the 50th birthday she threw for him. 


Her husband informed authorities on Monday, June 24, that he believed that she was poisoning him.


Last month, he noticed that his Mountain Dew had an ""odd"" taste to it, which he initially ignored. However, he found that he became increasingly sick and began suffering from diarrhoea, vomiting, and a sore throat. 


He noticed that whenever he drank Mountain Dew outside of his home, the beverage tasted how it was supposed to. When he drank from the two-litre bottles stored in the garage at his home, however, they had the same ""weird"" taste.




He later obtained what he said was proof of her poisoning the bottles when he checked footage from a camera he set up in the garage. 


“[The husband] said the video showed Michelle taking a two-litre bottle of Diet Mountain Dew out of the garage refrigerator and a bottle of Roundup weed killer into the house,"" reads the affidavit. ""[He] said that Michelle then returned the soda to the refrigerator and put the Roundup back on the shelf in the garage.”


He said that he became ""afraid for his life"" after seeing the footage, so he gave a copy of it to someone he knew ""in case he died from being poisoned."" The affidavit states that he told authorities he began putting untampered bottles of Mountain Dew in the refrigerator, but she would find a way to put Roundup in it every time. 


When he told her that he was feeling sick, she replied that ""he probably had COVID."" He later recorded a video that showed her putting insecticide in a bottle of Mountain Dew.




When questioned by the authorities, she denied the allegations until she was presented with the video evidence. She confessed to authorities and admitted she ""should have just divorced"" him. 


""Michelle said she was mad at [her husband] because she had thrown him a 50th birthday party and he was not appreciative,"" reads the affidavit, which adds that she told police she put the Roundup in his drinks ""to be mean.""


The primary ingredient in Roundup is glyphosate, which can cause organ failure and death if ingested. She is currently being held at the Laclede County Detention Center without bond.

How German podcast tracked down fugitive militant after 30 years,"Daniela Klette lived quietly. She walked her dog and gave maths tuition to her neighbours’ children.


But when she was arrested in late February, the police found tens of thousands of euros in cash in her Berlin flat and five weapons, among them a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a replica rocket launcher.


Klette, 65, had been on the run for more than 30 years. She was wanted for crimes connected to the left-wing militant Red Army Faction (RAF), which was active in Germany from the 1970s to the 1990s.


Known in its early days as the Baader Meinhof group, the gang pursued their political aims through the kidnap or murder of senior members of the business and industrial communities.


The RAF’s notoriety had led to a podcast team in Berlin trying to track Klette down using a facial recognition tool.




The podcast ran shortly before Christmas, only weeks before the arrest. But police deny a connection. They say they had a tip-off from a member of the public.

The RAF’s crimes are not forgotten in Germany, even if a generation has passed since they were committed.


They continue to exercise the imaginations of film and television producers, who have been making high-budget drama and documentary series that recall the assassinations of the 1980s and 90s.


“The RAF is deeply rooted in the collective memory, at least in western Germany,” says Petra Terhoeven, an expert in the history of political violence at Göttingen University.




Later this year, for example, German television will run a new four-part drama about Alfred Herrhausen, the head of Deutsche Bank, who was murdered shortly after the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989. A sophisticated roadside bomb destroyed his armoured Mercedes as he was being driven to work.


In 2020 the first Netflix original series for the German market, A Perfect Crime, examined the assassination of Detlev Rohwedder. He was the head of the Treuhandanstalt, the organisation established after German reunification to privatise all state-owned industry in the former East Germany.


Rohwedder was killed by a shot from a sniper’s rifle through an upstairs window at his home in Düsseldorf in the spring of 1991.


In neither case have the perpetrators been caught.




The Netflix series was made by the Beetz Brothers production company. Recalling its origins, co-director Georg Tschurtschenthaler says the brief was to find a project that the whole country would talk about. “It had to be big and relevant,” he says. “It had to create some noise.”


Georg Tschurtschenthaler said the period of RAF attacks still resonate today in Germany


A Perfect Crime, while acknowledging the letter found at the crime scene in which the RAF claimed responsibility for Rohwedder’s murder, presents a number of different scenarios as to who may have killed him. For Tschurtschenthaler the background to the murder is what matters – the rapid closure of much of East German industry and the loss of millions of jobs.


“It’s a dark period that resonates until today,” he says.


Petra Terhoeven, the historian, warns of the dangers of a trivialisation of the crimes committed by the RAF. She detects too great a focus on the perpetrators, too little consideration for the victims.




The victim who has received perhaps most attention is Alfred Herrhausen, a charismatic and influential banker and a personal friend of then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A new documentary will accompany the four-part television drama later this year. Herrhausen has also been portrayed in fiction, by the writer Tanja Langer.


“When I was writing my novel it was important for me to create an homage to this person,” she says of her book. The novel, an account of a relationship between a young woman and an older man, a banker, is written from personal experience. Langer and Herrhausen had a close friendship for several years until his death.


Even though the RAF claimed responsibility for Herrhausen’s murder, Tanja Langer thinks the truth may not be as simple. She did several years’ research for her novel and spent a lot of time in the archive of the former East German secret police, the Stasi.


“In the end my conclusion was that even if the RAF carried out the murder, maybe there were others that were also part of it,” she says.




Tanja Langer was a close friend of Alfred Herrhausen


It’s that uncertainty, in part, that fuels the continued interest. There are still many unsolved murders from the 1980s and it’s possible that Daniela Klette, now behind bars, knows something about them.


Not long before she was arrested, a podcast company in Berlin, Undone, set out to find her. They had been contacted by a listener who said he’d been at a party where a woman had claimed to be Klette.


“It was a crazy story,” says Patrick Stegemann, who worked on the series.


Undone brought in an AI expert who deployed facial recognition software to search the internet for pictures that matched one of Klette on an old “Wanted” poster. It came up with a match for a woman living as “Claudia” not far from where the podcasters operate out of an old industrial premises in Berlin. But when they went to look for her, she was nowhere to be found.




Two months later, when Daniela Klette, was arrested, it became clear that they had identified the right woman. Patrick Stegemann remembers hearing the news of the arrest. “It was a wild mixture of feelings,” he says.


Prosecutors are currently going through dozens of boxes of evidence and are yet to bring charges against Klette.


Petra Terhoeven is sceptical she will offer any help.


“The majority of former members of the RAF don't speak about the past,” she says. “It’s like a political sect, it’s a kind of cartel of silence. And so probably she will remain silent.”

US: Drunk driver drove to work with severed arm of pedestrian he killed in passenger seat,"A Dallas man has been arrested after allegedly hitting and killing a pedestrian while drunk driving, and then driving to his place of employment with the victim’s severed arm in the passenger seat of the vehicle.


The Dallas Police Department confirmed to PEOPLE that Juan Morgan Munoz, 31, was arrested and charged with felony DWI and collision involving death. They added that additional charges are possible.


He was taken to the Dallas County jail after reportedly fleeing the scene of the fatal accident, according to news outlets KDFW and WFAA. 


Although Munoz did call 911 to alert authorities, he allegedly did not do so until more than 30 minutes after the unidentified victim was killed, around 12:30 a.m early Saturday morning, according to KDFW.


The driver reportedly confessed to hitting the victim near Storey Lane and I-35E, but continued on his way to work about a mile away, according to both news outlets.




Authorities arrived at Munoz's job at Maaco Auto Body Shop after Munoz made his phone call, according to the outlets. They allegedly found his white BMW with a ""hole in the front passenger windshield"" and ""an entire arm on the front passenger seat"" along with blood.


He also reportedly had ""glassy/watery eyes, slurred speech and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage,” according to an arrest warrant affidavit reportedly obtained by the local news stations. 


When given a breathalyzer test, Munoz's reading allegedly came back as a .179, which is more than twice the legal limit, according to WFAA.

Munoz reportedly told the officers he had ""one Patron shot in the afternoon,” and had been coming from a Hooters in Grand Prairie before heading to work. He did not pass any of the field sobriety tests given to him, per WFAA.




Before being booked into jail, Munoz reportedly admitted that cocaine was also in his system, also according to WFAA.


The pedestrian who was killed has not been identified.

This Finnish city blasts classical music to keep youths away,"For the past few years, police in the Finnish city of Espoo have been employing an intriguing tactic to keep youths from partying on a local beach – blasting classical music from loudspeakers.


There is no scientific evidence that young people have an aversion to classical music, but police in Espoo swear that it works, and the fact that they have been using this tactic for the last six years is a testament to that. Apparently, at the end of the school, year, the beach in Espoo’s Haukilahti neighborhood becomes a popular gathering place for youths eager to party until the late hours of the night. Local authorities had tried multiple other methods to disperse youths, but nothing worked quite as well as classical music masterpieces like Strauss’ The Blue Danube, Vivaldi’s Four Seasons and Schubert’s Ave Maria. So, starting in early June, police blast classical music from a couple of loudspeakers on the beach to keep youths from gathering there after sunset.


“For some reason, classical music doesn’t appeal to young people and young people stay away from places where there is classical music,” Mikko Juvonen of the Western Uusimaa police department told Yle. “It’s better for us to keep the youngsters on dry land, and it’s nice for families to come and swim here in the morning when the beach is clean.”


Before implementing the classical music method six years ago, Haukilahti was a popular gathering place for end of term parties that usually left piles of litter and broken glass in their wake. Now, Espoo police no longer have to worry, because no youths want to be around when the classical music starts playing.


A number of locals confessed that they found the police initiative a bit strange, but since it’s working so well, no one seems to be complaining.

Ghanaian mother of son with special needs in US tells story of how social media saved her life,"A Ghanaian residing in the USA, Naana Donkor Arthur has turned her life around through the power of social media. She is a content creator, master of ceremonies, promoter, and philanthropist.


However, it is her deeply personal journey with her 15-year-old son Charlton, who is on the autism spectrum, which has defined her path and inspired many.


Charlton, Naana’s eldest among her four children, has autism, a condition that has brought immense challenges to their family. 


Despite the joy of raising three other children, including a set of twins, Charlton’s condition has been a constant source of emotional strain for Naana. She often found herself overwhelmed with tears, praying fervently for her son’s healing.


Amid the struggles, Naana discovered a lifeline in social media. What started as a means of distraction soon became a therapeutic outlet. 




Through platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook, she began sharing her story and connecting with others who understood her journey. 


The interactions with her followers provided her with solace and a sense of community that she desperately needed.


“Social media became my therapy,” Naana shares. 


“It was a place where I could express my fears, my hopes, and my prayers. The support and understanding from my followers were overwhelming. They lifted me when I felt like I couldn’t go on.”




Naana’s candidness and resilience quickly resonated with many, particularly parents of autistic children. Her platform grew, not just as a space for sharing her experiences but as a beacon of hope and inspiration.





She began offering advice and support, sharing resources, and even making donations to families in similar situations. 


Her journey from a place of despair to one of empowerment has inspired countless others to find strength and hope.


In addition to her social media impact, Naana has made significant strides in philanthropy.




She is the founder of NDA Charity, a non-governmental organization in Ghana dedicated to helping the needy. Her work through NDA Charity has provided essential support to countless individuals, further cementing her commitment to making a difference.


“Helping others has always been a part of me,” Naana says. 


“Through NDA Charity, I want to give back to my community in Ghana and make a tangible difference in people’s lives. It’s about spreading hope and love, just as I’ve received it.”


Naana Donkor Arthur’s story is a powerful reminder of the transformative power of community and compassion. 




Through social media, she found not only a means to cope with her challenges but also a platform to inspire and support others. 


Her journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the incredible impact one individual can have on the lives of many.


As Naana continues to share her story and extend her hand to those in need, she embodies the true essence of philanthropy and the power of social media to change lives. For many, she is not just a content creator or a promoter; she is a beacon of hope and a source of strength.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

Joke Silva debunks rumor of husband Olu Jacobs death,"Veteran Nollywood thespian Joke Silva, the wife of veteran actor, Olu Jacob’s has debunked the rumour of her husband’s death, saying he is much alive and doing just fine.


This is the second time rumours about the death of the legendary Nigerian actor will be making the rounds on social media.

A close source to the family (name withheld), told Vanguard on phone that the AGN President told him that he spoke with the wife today and they spoke for over one hour without any mention of such news.


“Somebody who has lost a husband cannot be that chatty and Gail on phone,” the source said.




Also, Betty Irabor, an associate of the family has also debunked the rumour.


The final nail on the coffin of the rumour was a broadcast by Channels TV where they were seen speaking with the actor who said he is alive and in fact preparing to go to Ikoyi Club this evening.

"Nigerians surprised I chose to live here, while they leave  Swiss married to Igbo","Janine Udogu is more than a wife to the people of Isuofia in Aguata, Anambra. She could pass for a pearl. And to millions across Nigeria, especially the Igbo, Janine, popularly known as Nwanyiocha has become a delight.


She wears the traditional title – ‘Lolo Anyanwu Ututu I’, conferred on her by the people of Isuofia.


An encounter with Janine would leave no one in doubt as to why she was crowned with such title. ‘Anyanwu Ututu’ means a rising morning sun. Such sun usually would rise gently, permeate mildly and have a way of motivating for the day.


So also is Janine’s personality which could inspire the uninspired, and particularly her complexion which radiates both at dawn and in the dark of the night.


Her enchanting demeanour typifies the Igbo ancient name, Adadioramma, which implies the delight of all. Humble, elegant, modest, with an adventurous zest and uncommon love for the Igbo and Nigerian; Nwanyiocha today poses as an ambassador, as she goes about celebrating and promoting the Nigerian way of life, especially that of the Igbo.




In a chat with Saturday Vanguard, Janine narrates how it all started, the near-mystery that birthed a union that has lasted for over 12 years with kids, the initial concerns and the decision to relocate to Nigeria for residence.


How it started


On the evening of a fateful day in 2008, Janine had gone to a club in Switzerland, her land of birth, to unwind. There, she caught the fancy of a young Nigerian, Ezenwa Udogu, who approached her for exchange of phone contacts. But Janine would not oblige. She rather opted for a stand that could be considered complicated. “If God wants us to meet again, we will meet”; she responded. God did cause them to meet again two days later.


But Janine wasn’t done with her drama. “If God wants us to meet again, we will meet”; she repeated. Two weeks later, they met again. This time, she reluctantly yielded, since she couldn’t ‘stretch’ God any further. Janine said she wasn’t thinking of relationship then.


“I just didn’t feel like it was something for me to go into a relationship that time. I was feeling he might want something else, but of course, thereafter, I realised he already had all his papers”.




Marriage


Having accepted a relationship, Janine got married to Ezenwa in 2012, when they had a court marriage in Switzerland. In January 2014, they travelled to Isuofia to exchange marital vows in a church.At first, Janine didn’t see the celebration of Nigeria as a priority. She was just set out to love and cherish Ezenwa, her husband; and to find a way to navigate through the many horrible things said about Nigeria. But arriving here, she found out that it wasn’t as bad as it was painted outside. She therefore, decided to tell the story as an eye witness.


The realisation that many were eager to hear her story, however, fuelled her energy. The issue of living in Nigeria was part of an agreement Janine had with Ezenwa when they got married. The agreement was anchored on the need to enable their kids know their roots and blend. Last year, they took the bull by the horn and left Switzerland for residence in Nigeria.


According to her, “The story is one sided about Nigeria in Europe and in my country. What pushed me was when none of my family members wanted to attend my wedding in the village for fear of security issues and all the horrible stories they hear. I came here every year on holiday. The way I see Nigeria and the way it is seen outside, I felt there was need for somebody to change the narrative a bit. It’s not like I wanted to be active on social media, but when I realised people were eager to hear my story, I decided to use the platform to showcase how I see Nigeria.


Relocation to Nigeria


“It was part of the agreement when we got married that it would be a priority for us to bring up our kids in Nigeria, knowing their roots, their language. My husband was married before to a Swiss lady, and she never really encouraged him to bring his child home. And him being the first son, it was obvious that any other children should be here, at least to know their language, know where the house is in the village and all that.




We decided this will be our chance to come home because the kids are already a bit grown. Let them start school here and experience Nigeria for themselves, not just visiting. We spent a lot of money coming here every year, yet it was just visiting. The Swiss were a bit worried, concerning security, access to health care and all of that.


That made them to ask me, are you sure you really want to do this? For Nigerians, it was very difficult for some people to understand how I could want to live here when they are trying everything possible to get out of Nigeria. But that’s the issue of having multicultural children. In Switzerland, they call my kids black; when they come here, people call them Oyibo. I think it’s important for them to know both and be proud of it, to say – Yes, I’m black, yes I’m white.


Also, Ezenwa as a traditional Igbo man wants to grow old here in Nigeria. So, I also needed to have this reality check and know how it feels to live here, because it’s always nice when you come to a place for vacation. But, can you really love there?.


Ezenwa’s love


“What swept me off my feet was the genuineness and intensity of Ezenwa’s love for me. It was the greatest I had. He would do everything for me. He is the kind that pays so much attention to what somebody needs. When I need him, it doesn’t matter the time, he would drop everything. For him, it’s family first. And he just showed me this love that I had never received from anybody else. I never had any doubt about his love towards me. He loves my heart. The way he is there for me is same way I’m always there for him. We are best of friends. I love him for who he is and not what he has”.




One of the landmarks Janine established in Ezenwa’s compound in Isuofia is a mango tree she planted years ago which now supplies fruits to the family and neighbours. This and some other traits have earned Janine what some would describe as ‘street credibility’. She is loved by the street.


She revealed that she treasures the strength of Umuada (an association of daughters married outside their home) in adjudicating matters in their maiden home.


Many parents of Igbo extraction seem to be competing in raising their kids in English Language and trampling upon their mother tongue. But a Swiss Nigerian is bent on ensuring that her kids become fluent in their native Igbo Language and immersed in their culture and Nigerian way of life. This is the irony. It is believed that Janine’s path will inspire a greater love in Nigerians for the Nigerian.

WASH expert urges focus on grey water to mitigate public health risk,"Provost of the College of Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Prof. Kwabena Biritwum Nyarko, is emphasising the critical need to address grey water management to prevent health and environmental consequences.


Speaking at his professorial inaugural lecture, he called on the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources to integrate Grey water Management in water and sanitation programming.


Greywater which refers to wastewater from our kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry sources is polluted, posing substantial environmental and health risks to communities.


According to the 2020 Population and Housing Census, 70% of the population disposes of their grey water by dumping it on the ground or in the street, while 27% allow it to flow into drains or gutters or directly throw it into these drains.


Again, 11% channel their greywater into a soakage pit (soakaway), and only 2% discharge greywater through the sewerage system.




At his lecture which is under the topic: “Universal access to water and sanitation services: A myth or reality?” he was worried grey water “has not received attention in Ghana.”


He further stated his research activities on grey water haven’t been encouraging.


“Our findings revealed the following: 36% of the average water consumed ends up as grey water. Grey water is polluted and requires treatment before disposal. Greywater contains micropollutants at levels higher than expected.


He added: “With less than 5% of Ghana’s population having access to sewerage systems, our reliance on onsite sanitation, which fails to address greywater challenges, is a significant concern. Untreated grey water.




“Universal access to water and sanitation will be meaningless unless greywater management is made an integral component.


“Achieving universal access to water and sanitation without addressing greywater issues will be meaningless.""


On the household level, Prof. Biritwum Nyarko believes “the least we can do is to use soakage pit or soak away.”

Physician assistant advocates for medical diagnosis before spiritual remedies,"A Physician Assistant at the Pleasant Medical Centre at Ashaiman Middle East, Rocky Tettedzie, has advised the public to seek proper medical diagnosis before turning to spiritual remedies. 


Mr Tettedzie emphasised the importance of visiting medical treatment centres first to identify any potential health issues and the needed intervention.


Speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), he acknowledged the role of spirituality and personal beliefs in personal healthcare decisions, stressing, however, that health institutions were equipped to detect problems through laboratory tests.


Mr Tettedzie stated that clinical conditions could sometimes be diagnosed without lab tests and in such cases, if lab investigations yielded negative results but the patient remained symptomatic, treatment might still be administered, often resulting in the patient's improvement.


He noted that when no medical cause can be identified, healthcare providers would explain to patients that health encompassed not only the absence of disease but also mental and physical well-being.




”While medical centres do not typically direct patients to seek spiritual remedies, there are rare instances where a clinician with spiritual insight might advise so, nonetheless, medical practice prioritises evidence-based treatments,” he said.


The physician assistant pointed out that some conditions, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be completely cured but could be managed to improve the patient's quality of life and prevent further complications. 


He urged people to avoid prioritising spiritual interventions over medical consultations, recommending a proper diagnosis first, if no medical issues were found, they could then explore spiritual avenues, stressing that the Holy Spirit is accessible to everyone for prayer and intervention, not just spiritual leaders.


He shared some experiences of patients with breast cancer, cervical cancer, hypertension, and diabetes who sought treatment at religious prayer camps. 




He said these patients often report to the hospitals very late when faced with severe complications or when their conditions have worsened.


Mr. Tettedzie clarified that no doctor would prevent a patient from seeking spiritual health, but medical professionals advised that individuals must first visit health institutions for early diagnosis, adding that clinics might have varied diagnoses, therefore what is undetected at one centre could be identified at another for treatment.

HIV: More babies getting infected despite PMTCT intervention,"The National Aids Control Programme (NACP) says there is an increase in HIV mother-to-child infections despite the implementation of the Mother-to Child Transmission (PMTCT).


Dr Stephen Ayisi-Addo, Programme Manager, the National Aids Control Programme (NACP), said the situation was due to a lack of testing and adherence to medication by pregnant women, hence the continuous infection from mothers to their babies.


At the 2023 dissemination of National HIV estimates, Dr Ayisi Addo expressed concern that facilities continue to record newborn babies infected with the virus, which is a transmission from the mother to the baby.


The Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission PMTCT) is one of the interventions instituted by NACP, Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) and partners to ensure the prevention of HIV transmission from mothers to their babies.


With the intervention, pregnant women would have to get tested for HIV at an Antenatal care service and those found positive would be put on medication to protect the baby from getting infected.




The National HIV estimation showed that 12,108 mothers, aged 15 to 49 years are receiving Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) treatment.


It also indicated that 13, 445, mothers needed PMTCT between the ages of 15 to 49 years.


He noted that a lot of the babies contracting HIV from their mothers were babies from mothers who missed testing during ANC, saying, “We are talking covering about 90 per cent of all ANC attendance for HIV testing, so those who come in late do not get the treatment to prevent the mother from transmission to the baby.


“We need to be able to improve the ANC testing coverage. We need to improve so that people will have supervised delivery on their routine services offered when pregnant women come to the facility,” he added.




The Programme Manager also indicated that lack of adherence to taking their medication by HIV-infected mothers was causing transmission from mothers to their newborns.


He said even with those tested and identified, not all of them get the anti-retroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission.


Besides, out of the about 6,000 PMTC facilities, just 730 facilities were delivering ARV.


Dr Ayisi Addo said at facilities where there was no PMTC coverage, pregnant women would have to be transferred to other facilities for such services, but they refuse to go due to transportation issues, hence, the new strategy to decentralise antiretroviral therapy across all centres.




He said postnatal transmission was also occurring due to exposure to breastfeeding.


As part of the interventions, the national response programme instituted strict infant feeding guidelines for HIV-positive mothers to prevent transmission.


However, some mothers are unable to adhere to the guidelines and such gaps are contributing to the continuous records of transmission.


The Programme Manager acknowledged that the infant feeding guidelines for persons living with HIV had been reduced due to the unavailability of trained service providers to educate the mothers as they missed the appropriate feeding procedure, getting their babies exposed to the virus.




“It is our aspiration and determination to make sure that we address all these issues and improve on strategic interventions to improve on the figures and reduce mother-to-child transmission to at least 2 per cent, which is an elimination target.


Dr Stephen Atuahene, Director General of the GAC, said strict adherence to treatment was key as it suppressed the virus and would help to avoid perinatal transmission.


He said it was important for HIV-positive women to achieve viral suppression before getting pregnant and necessary to maintain the suppression status, saying, “It is also the responsibility of the mother to adhere to treatment, maintain viral suppression status and avoid transmission.


“As long as you can do that, you have a better chance of averting transmission to your baby and so adherence is very crucial to all persons living with HIV and taking the medication. This is so important for mothers because every woman will want to have a healthy baby and therefore you have to avoid any risk that will expose your child to infection.”

More teachers benefit from One Teacher One Laptop Programme in Greater Accra,"Government's One Teacher One Laptop programme continues to benefit public school teachers in the Greater Accra Region. 


Recently, 600 teachers from the Ada East and West District Directorates of the Ghana Education Service (GES) received laptops.


At Ada Foah in the Ada East District, eager teachers completed the necessary administrative processes, including presenting their Ghana Cards and signatures, to receive their laptops. 





Many expressed delight upon receiving their new computers.


In the Ada West District, eligible teachers gathered at the District Office in Sege for distribution. Nearly all eligible teachers received their laptops.




District Director of Education, Stephen Arthur, expressed gratitude to the Ghana Education Service (GES), the Ministry of Education, and the teacher unions for the initiative. 





He emphasised the importance of laptops and internet access in enabling Ghanaian teachers to participate in the global village. 





Mr Arthur hoped the devices would be used effectively for the benefit of both teachers and students.


The ongoing distribution is part of a nationwide effort to ensure all public school teachers benefit from the scheme. 







The One Teacher One Laptop program was launched by Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in September 2021 to enhance education delivery through information technology and to improve teaching and learning outcomes in pre-tertiary educational institutions nationwide.


Under the program, every public school teacher, from kindergarten to senior high school, is to receive a laptop to aid in lesson preparation, research, and learning. 


Government covers 70% of the laptop's cost, with teachers paying the remaining 30%.

Societe Generale Ghana and Accra Senior High High School partner for Green Ghana Initiative,"Société Générale Ghana, in collaboration with Accra High Senior Secondary School, has launched a tree planting initiative as part of this year's Green Ghana programme.


The event, held at Accra High Senior Secondary School on Friday, June 28, was attended by representatives from the Forestry Commission, including Diana Ampedu and Millicent Dilson from the nursery department.


President Akufo-Addo proclaimed June 11, 2021, as Green Ghana Day, marking it as an annual event dedicated to safeguarding the nation's forests and the environment.


The initiative involves tree planting across various designated areas nationwide, coordinated by the Forestry Commission. Corporate organisations and institutions, such as Société Générale Ghana, engage directly with the Commission to participate in these efforts.







During the opening ceremony, the Assistant Headmistress of Academics at Accra High School, Mrs Monica Botchway, welcomed Société Générale Ghana's initiative on behalf of the headmistress, Miss Evelyne Nabia, staff, students, and management.




Mrs Botchway highlighted the school’s progress and underscored the challenges faced, particularly the need for a boarding house.


“On behalf of the board members, the headmistress, Miss Evelyne Sagbil Nabia, the staff, the students and the management we welcome Mr Hakim Ouzzani and the team from Société Générale Ghana to Accra High School”.


“We are happy to have you here to collaborate with us on this year's Green Ghana programme. We look forward to more collaboration in the future.”


Speaking at the event, Hakim Ouzzani, Managing Director of Société Générale Ghana, emphasised the importance of tree planting for every individual. He underscored that the current global count of approximately 3 trillion trees vastly outweighs the human population of 7.7 billion.







Mr Ouzzani highlighted the pressing need for increased tree planting efforts due to ongoing deforestation and related activities. He stressed that despite the vast number of trees, it remains insufficient to counterbalance environmental impacts effectively.


Addressing the gathering, Senior Quality Analyst for the Office of the President for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Nana Yaw Amirika urged the students to actively participate in tree planting initiatives for the benefit of future generations at their school.







He emphasised that tree planting should be embraced as a hobby, highlighting its importance beyond immediate benefits. Mr Amirika reiterated that the government's initiative aims to ensure the sustainability of the planet for current and future generations.


“The government initiative is mainly to ensure that the only planet we call home survives whiles we are here and after we are gone. So, I urge you all to take that into consideration as we continue the exercise today.”




The Forestry Commission spearheaded the tree-planting initiative involving mango, coconut, oil palm, and mimusops trees.

"NSMQ2024: GHANASCO beat rivals TAMASCO, St. Francis Xavier to win Northern Zonal championship","Ghana Senior High School now holds the bragging rights as the new champions of the Goil Plc Northern Zonal Championship of the National Science and Maths Quiz.


In a dramatic contest for academic supremacy, the school beat their city rivals, Tamale SHS and Upper West’s St. Francis Xavier Seminary to clinch the ultimate title.


The atmosphere at the GNAT Hall in Tamale was characterised by sheer rivalry between the two Tamale-based schools boasting to be the overlords of the north.


The two schools had met in the semi-final stage where Tamale SHS handed GHANASCO a painful defeat.


But qualifying as the top runner-up from the semi-finals, GHANASCO was determined to revenge their nemesis at the grand finale.







The final contest proved to be a tough one for the lions of TAMASCO as they failed to keep up with the comfortable pace they had begun with at the beginning of the contest.


Consumed by a fervent desire to win and make history, the boys from GHANASCO looked unperturbed when they trailed Tamale SHS at the end of the first round with a four-point difference.


The school overturned the contest in the second round to lead with 6 points while TAMASCO and Xavescan were pegged at 23-points each.


St. Francis Xavier kept its margin between the GHANASCO but contrary to the brave speed of their totem (lions), TAMASCO barely could keep up with the momentum of the two schools.




Tamale SHS ended the third round with 24 points, as their contenders, Ghana SHS and St. Francis Xavier, accrued 42 and 36 points respectively.


At this point, the TAMASCANS were troubled and had already given up on their quest for a second trophy.


In the final round, the school however managed to answer two of the riddles correctly but that couldn’t garner them enough points to close the margin.


Wild cheers erupted within the four walls of the GNAT Hall in Tamale after GHANASCO answered a riddle to extend their lead affirming their stance to be the winners of the contest.




At the end of the contest, Ghana SHS secured 45 points while St. Francis Xavier Seminary came second with 36 points with Tamale SHS taking the third position with 30 points.


GHANASCO commenced their journey to the trophy from the regional qualifiers stage after they were knocked out at the one-eighth stage in 2023 of the national competition.


They are optimistic of an even masterful performance at the national tournament as they set out to become the debut national winners for the five Northern regions.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Freddie and Kwame Blay sue Okudzeto Ablakwa and media outlets for defamation,"In two separate lawsuits, former New Patriotic Party (NPP) Chairman Freddie Blay and his son, Kwame Blay, have sued Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa for defamatory publications, falsely implicating them in the alleged theft of state property. 


While Kwame Blay's lawsuit is solely against the North Tongu MP, Freddie Blay's suit also names Media General and Johnnie Hughes as defendants.


First Lawsuit:Kwame Blay emphasises that he is a distinct individual from his brother, Kwaw, and has no involvement in the activities of the Polo Beach Club or any entity affiliated with it. 


He categorically states that he has never dealt with Loic Devos Jnr, who is currently in a legal dispute with one of his brother's businesses, Press Xpress. 


Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.

Held at the Ghana Institution of Engineering in Accra, the social impact initiative which recorded over 60 participants (in-person and virtual), forms part of this year’s World Public Relations Day Festival (WPRD Festival).


The masterclass focused on essential sustainability topics such as crafting impactful sustainability reports and integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles into communication strategies.

The key facilitators were Prince Osisiadan, CEO of SUCCA Africa and a GRI Certified Trainer; Rita Agyeiwaa Rockson, Foundation, Sustainability, and External Communication Manager at Telecel Ghana; and Osei-Asenso Antwi, Senior Manager for Governance, Risk, Compliance, and ESG Services at KPMG.




The Power of Sustainability Storytelling


In her presentation, Rita Agyeiwaa Rockson championed the power of Sustainable messaging and storytelling. She reiterated the importance of tailoring narratives to resonate with specific audiences and leveraging data and infographics to enhance impact.


According to her, the role of PR professionals in crafting compelling stories to showcase sustainability efforts can help organisations build positive reputations.

She encouraged PR professionals to position their stories meaningfully for the media and maintain cultural relevance in their storytelling.





Transparency leads the way in Sustainability Narratives


The Chief Executive Officer of SUCCA Africa, Prince Osisiadan provided an in-depth look at crafting impactful Sustainability and ESG Reporting and Disclosures.


Mr. Osisiadan offered a practical framework for crafting compelling reports, including simplifying complex information for broader audiences which aligns with the growing demand for clear and concise communication of a company's sustainability efforts.




He indicated the importance of transparency and clear communication in building trust. “A good sustainability report should be transparent and honest, supported by verifiable records. 


""Clarity and accessibility in ESG reporting, advocating for the use of digital tools over traditional methods must be adopted”

Osei emphasized the importance of creating an environment where the next generation will be at peace with the surroundings. 




He underscored that sustainability involves balancing environmental and social concerns and promoting benefits without incurring losses.





PR professionals, he noted, need to stay informed and updated on policies and regulations, serving as the key link between the organisation and its stakeholders.


Sustainability for all: A Collaborative Approach


In her welcoming remarks, the Chief Director of Global Media Alliance, Emma Wenani, highlighted the growing importance of sustainability. 




""In today's world, sustainability is no longer a niche concern, it's a core business focus. PR professionals play a crucial role in communicating sustainability efforts effectively.”

Jacquelyn Makumator-Jones, Foundation and Sustainability Specialist at Telecel Ghana, the event headline sponsor, reaffirmed the company's commitment to sustainable practices within the communications industry.

SSNIT pledges further stakeholder engagement on hotels sale after NPRA directive,"The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) has revealed that it has halted negotiations leading to the sale of a 60 per cent stake in some six hotels. This is in line with a directive from the National Pensions Regulatory Authority, NPRA.


The Director General of SSNIT, Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo disclosed this at a media engagement on the operations of the State Pension Trust.


He however added they will embark on more stakeholder engagement on the matter, to let all the partners and actors appreciate the need to reduce their interest in these hotels so they can get more from their investment in the sector.


Mr Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo insisted that its stake in Labadi Beach Hotel has not been sold, adding even before this action by the National Pensions Regulatory Authority, negotiations had stalled, “on the payment model and other concerns that had come up.


The Director General of SSNIT added that these negotiations were done in good faith to ensure that they get the best out of SSNIT’s assets.




Asked whether SSNIT would have gone through the same route looking at the current challenges with the sale, the Director General said, “More engagement with all the interested parties would have helped to avoid all these current challenges.”


The Director maintained that “at a point in time, when assets are not performing a decision has to be taken, hence the need to sell some interest in these hotels.


“If anyone presents an offer that will help us get the best why don’t we take it “he noted.

The Director General of SSNIT however described the letter coming from the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) as surprising, looking at the fact that they had engaged them on these issues.


“We had met the Authority on all these issues only that our last meeting was inconclusive because we also had to go to the presidency for another stakeholder engagement with the Unions.


Background


The National Pensions Regulatory Authority NPRA in a letter directed the Social Security and National Insurance Trust to halt negotiations leading to the sale of its interest in some of the hotels owned by SSNIT to Rock City, a company owned by the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Bryan Acheampong.




The NPRA in that letter also revealed that it is engaging the Minister for Employment on this issue and other developments. Even before the NPRA sent this letter to the SSNIT, organized labour had been engaging with the government over the sale of these hotels, raising some objections to the process.


The Director General of SSNIT justified the sale insisting some of the hotels have failed over the years to pay dividends to SSNIT, while some have been incurring losses.


“Therefore, the institution took a decision to reduce their interest in these hotels so that they can share the risk with a strategic investor going forward.”


He revealed that in the case of La Palm, it has made losses in 11 years out of 15 years, and those who even did the valuation told them to pull the hotel down.




“SSNIT had long taken that decision to restructure interest in non-performing assets, including these hotels” the Director General of SSNIT noted.


“We have been faced with consistent losses by some of these hotels, frequent requests for maintenance funding, capital injection requirement, high expenditure cost.”


Procurement and Selection Process of a strategic Investor and valuation


According to the SSNIT head, the decision to dispose of some of their interest in these hotels started in 2018, when the board set up a steering committee.




“The committee comprised all the Board Chairpersons of the various hotels, three Board members and some management staff from SSNIT” he added.


The Director General added that the selection of SEM capital to carry out the valuation was done appropriately, denying the assertion that, they hand-picked the transaction advisers.


“SSNIT went through International Competitive Tendering (ICT) processes as prescribed by the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (ACT 663), as amended by ACT 914, for the selection of a strategic investor” Kofi Bosompem Osafo-Maafo.


“The Trust engaged a Transaction Advisor through the ICT method of procurement, with the publication of advertisements in the Daily Graphic on 14th November 2018 and in the Ghanaian Times on 15th November 2018. As of the 16th January 2019 deadline, fifteen (15) firms had expressed interest in submitting bids “he noted.




He added that approval was sought from the Central Tender Review Committee (CTRC) for the selection of a Transaction Advisor on 12th December 2019 and it was granted on 24th December 2019.He also revealed that advertisements for an Expression of Interest (EOI) for a Strategic Partner for SSNIT Hotels were placed in the Daily Graphic on 3rd February 2022 and in the Ghanaian Times on 7th February 2022.


“The advertisement was also published in the Economist Magazine on 26th February, 2022” he added.


He said a total of nine (9) companies responded to the advertisements by submitting proposals on the 23rd March 2022 deadline.


According to him, the Entity Tender Committee (ETC), on 25th May 2022 considered the evaluation report on the EOI and approved the recommendation to invite the six (6) firms that qualified for the evaluation of the EOI to submit Technical and Financial Proposals for Private Participation in SSNIT-Owned Hotels.




These are Rock City Hotel Limited, Yaw Addo Development, Spartan-Ives, Temple Investments, Westridge Developers Ghana Limited, and Luxor Hotels Limited.


The Director General added that the bidding was done in a lot system, with the Hotels that were heavily bid being Labadi Beach and La Palm Hotel.”


Concerns of Interference and political exposure issues


The Director General of SSNIT also rejected allegations that undue pressure had been brought on them to sell their interest in some hotels to Rock City.


“We went through all the right processes to settle on this strategic investor”.


He also challenged claims that at the time of submitting their bid documents, Rock City had not been issued with a tax certificate by the Ghana Revenue Authority.


The Director General of SSNIT also admitted that issues about political exposure regarding this strategic investor may have played a role in the current opposition to this deal by sections of the public and some trade unions.


The Director General of SSNIT also rejected claims by former New Patriotic Party Chairman, Freddie Blay that, Spartan-Ives offered 200 million dollars for the purchase of the hotels.


“Freddie Blay only presented a bid and even that was 150 million dollars,” the Director General of SSNIT revealed.

"Prof Kofi Amoako urges corporate entities, PSA, and MNEs to use their CSR dimensions to contribute to SDGs","Professor George Kofi Amoako, a renowned marketing guru and consultant has called on Corporate Entities, Public Sector Agencies (PSA), and Multinational Enterprises(MNEs) to use their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to contribute significantly to the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by all members of the United Nations in 2015.


According to Professor Amoako, most companies are implementing CSR and CSI activities without paying any significant attention to the protection and preservation of the environment and the Sustainable Development Goals.


This, he said, had created a huge gap that demanded the attention of all corporate stakeholders such as industries, professional bodies, and academia.


Prof Amoako, speaking to the media stated that, if multi-national enterprises and Public Sector Agencies (PSA) did not align their respective CSR and CSI activities, it would be extremely difficult to achieve all the 17 World Sustainable Development Goals by the deadline of 2030.


Prof. George Kofi Amoako recently led a team of renowned researchers from April 2023 to May 2024 to conduct research into Corporate Social Responsibility and brand performance in Ghana with a sample size of 1106.




The findings of the research from the data collected from 1106 distributing, wholesaling, retailing, and vending firms involved in telecommunications activities in Ghana revealed that brand knowledge positively impacted organizational brand value.


Further, Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility and Ethical Corporate Social Responsibility were positively related to brand knowledge and brand loyalty.


Also, social CSR was positively related to brand knowledge and organizational brand value.


The research was very helpful in understanding how CSR dimensions significantly affected brand performance across multiple industries.




Prof Amoako, however, urged Corporate Ghana to offer cutting-edge training programmes for their employees on CSR and CSI so that they would be well informed, thereby utilizing their acquired skills and knowledge to help the respective institutions and corporate entities to re-align their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities or Corporate Social Investments to be in tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals.


Professor Amoako added that “if all the Corporate Entities, Public Sector Agencies and Multinational Enterprises are able to utilize fully the CSR Dimensions, they would greatly enhance their brand performance, attract and retain more customers/consumers, improve their revenue generation capabilities while at the same time helping society to preserve and protect the environment.”


Before joining the academia, Prof. George Amoako worked in the industry for several years. He has over 30 years of multi-experience in industry, consulting, and teaching at the university level. He previously worked with the prestigious Mechanical Lloyd and Fan Milk Ghana Limited.


In the area of consultancy and training services, Prof. George Kofi Amoako has consulted and done training for many public and private multi-national companies and organizations such as the Bank of Ghana, Ghana Insurance Commission, Ghana Ports and Harbour Authority, Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, British Council and several others.




Professor George Kofi Amoako is a Full Professor of Marketing, and is currently, the Director of Research, Innovation and Consultancy at the Ghana Communication Technology University.He has a proven expertise and track record in consultancy services, corporate training, and delivering and implementing marketing strategies and projects.


Professor George Kofi Amoako was awarded the Top Africa CSR Award in 2015 in Mauritius for his publications in Corporate Social Responsibility. Professor Amoako is ranked among the Top 4 Marketing Scholars in Ghana and the Top 3% in Africa according to the AD Scientific Index for 2024.


In 2023, Durban University of Technology in South Africa conferred Honorary Full Professor in Marketing on Professor George Kofi Amoako for his strategic marketing brilliance and significant impact in the field of marketing in Africa and beyond.


The main research focus areas of Prof. George Kofi Amoako are Sustainability, Marketing, Branding, Business Strategy, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Environmental Conservation.He has done over 30 national assignments for the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) over the past five years.




Professor George Kofi Amoako finally urged Corporate Ghana, especially the Mining and Petroleum Industries, to significantly review and re-align their respective CSR and CSI activities so that collectively we could protect and preserve the Environment and the social well-being of the people.

NHIA makes June payment to 6 hospitals providing free dialysis treatment,"The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has announced the successful payment of 587,236.00 cedis to six major healthcare providers.


This marks the first month of implementation under the government’s new initiative aimed at supporting patients undergoing chronic dialysis treatment.


In a statement released on Sunday, the NHIA detailed that the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH), Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital (ENRH), Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH), Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH), and the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) had all submitted their respective lists of chronic dialysis patients treated in June.


The Authority noted that each of these institutions has been reimbursed accordingly, ensuring the continuation of essential dialysis treatments for patients in need.


“This initiative is a crucial step towards alleviating the financial burden on chronic dialysis patients and ensuring they receive the necessary medical attention without interruption,” parts of the statement read.




On the 1st of June 2024, the NHIA in a press statement announced a free six-month dialysis support programme for renal patients from June to December 2024.


The programme will support high-risk populations of renal patients under the age of 18 years and those over 60 years by offering eight free dialysis sessions monthly.


Additionally, the programme partially covers patients between the ages of 18 and 59 years who would receive two free dialysis sessions a month at designated public hospitals nationwide.

Euro 2024: England come from behind to beat Slovakia to advance to quarterfinals,"Jude Bellingham produced a moment of genius to keep England in Euro 2024 as they survived another desperate display and a huge scare to beat Slovakia in dramatic fashion to reach the last eight.


England were seconds away from an embarrassing exit in Gelsenkirchen as Slovakia defended a lead they had held since the 25th minute when Ivan Schranz raced into the box to poke a low finish past England keeper Jordan Pickford.


It was then that Bellingham, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Saturday, demonstrated the brilliance that has made him England’s new superstar by going airborne in the penalty area to send Marc Guehi’s headed flick past Martin Dubravka with a stunning overhead kick.


Bellingham rescued England from a performance that scaled such depths that his goal was their first effort on target – but then set the platform for a victory as Slovakia, who had defended so stubbornly, were left stunned.


And captain Harry Kane emphasised England’s sudden superiority a minute into the extra 30 minutes when he headed home from close range to complete a remarkable turnaround and set up a quarter-final meeting with Switzerland.




England’s display before Bellingham’s wonder goal was another to add to the catalogue of mediocrity they have delivered under Gareth Southgate in Germany, even though Kane had missed an easy header and Declan Rice struck a post as they strived for the equaliser.


Bellingham, the young man with the Midas touch, came up with the goods to save them at the death as England's stuttering Euro 2024 journey goes on.

"Petrol price to go up 2%, LPG by 5% from July 1, 2024  IES","The price of petrol is expected to go up by 2.0% from July 1, 2024, for the next two weeks, the Institute for Energy Security has revealed.


At the same time, the price of diesel will surge by 4.0%, whilst that of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) will shoot up by 5%.


The expected increase in fuel prices is due to the depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar and the increase in the prices of finished petroleum products on the international market.


“Following the negative price changes recorded on the international market for petroleum products adding to the consistent fall (-1.85%) of the Ghana Cedi, fuel prices at the local pumps are expected to surge. Considering the developments in the foreign fuel market and the domestic forex market, the Institute for Energy Security (IES) anticipates an increase in fuel prices in the first half of July 2024, on account of the worsening performance of the Ghana cedi”.


World Fuel Market




The IES said its monitoring of the global Standard & Poor's (S&P's) Platts on petroleum products performance in the world fuel market shows that the price of petrol, diesel, and LPG increased in the second pricing window for June 2024.


The published data for the second pricing window of June 2024 showed that petrol closed at $816.61 per metric tonne. Diesel went for $778.32 per metric tonne, and LPG closed at $477.80 per metric tonne. The net changes indicate that the price of petrol has increased by 1.45%, diesel by 6.84%, and LPG by 9.03%.


Local Fuel Market Performance


The IES daily monitoring of activities on the domestic fuel market for the second pricing window for June 2024 observed relative stability in the price for liquid fuels from Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).




Diesel and petrol sold at GH₡14.06 and GH₡14.26 per litre respectively, whereas LPG went for GH₡15.96 per kilogramme.

Judge upholds decision refusing protection for Ghanaian man who claimed he was persecuted for being gay,"Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell in High Court notes assessing credibility of assertions about sexual orientation ‘undoubtedly’ sensitive and difficult.


It was not unreasonable or irrational for a tribunal to reject a Ghanaian man’s claim that he was openly gay and had therefore been subjected to persecution, the High Court has held.


Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell on Friday refused the divorced father-of-three’s request for him to overturn the International Protection Appeal Tribunal’s affirmation of a decision to refuse him refugee status and subsidiary protection.


The judge said findings were made during the international protection process that impugned the credibility of the applicant’s accounts of persecution and his claim that he was gay.


Assessing the credibility of assertions about sexual orientation are “undoubtedly” sensitive and difficult, but “they are assessments that have to be made”, Mr Justice O’Donnell said. Here, the tribunal had “conspicuously” endeavored to assess this claim with reference to the appropriate standards, he said.




The judge said the tribunal accepted that gay men may face extreme discrimination and homophobia in Ghana, where violent homophobic attacks are common.


Ghana’s parliament had passed a bill last February seeking a prison sentence of up to three years for anyone convicted of “identifying” as LGBT+. Engaging in gay sexual acts was already an imprisonable offence.


The applicant arrived in Ireland in February 2020 and immediately sought international protection at Dublin Airport. He was called for an interview with the International Protection Office 26 months later, and was in June 2022 refused refugee status, subsidiary protection and leave to remain.


The tribunal upheld this decision in November 2022 and the man issued judicial review proceedings at the High Court over this rejection the following month.




He alleged that the tribunal legally erred in determining that his account was not credible, and had made findings based on an assumption about the experience of a gay man. Further, he claimed, the tribunal had breached principles of fair procedure by making findings about his credibility without putting them to him for a response.


The tribunal fully stood over its determination, which it argued was lawful, fair and reasonable.


Mr Justice O’Donnell said the applicant told the tribunal he had been married and had three children. He had “lost touch for women” after his divorce in 2017 and met a man in 2018 who told him “about [being] gay and how it was going on”, the applicant said.


He said he decided to give it a try and he moved in with the man that year and felt like he was in the right position, and is no longer interested in women. He said his family was disgusted when they heard he was living with a man, and he felt like an outcast to them. He claimed he was attacked three times in Ghana between 2017 and 2020.




Due to an accumulation of unexplained issues with his narrative, the tribunal had significant doubts about his credibility and could not accept he had been persecuted. The tribunal said that although he may “simply have been naive or reckless”, his account of engaging in a carefree way in an openly gay relationship in the face of widespread intolerance and oppression seemed “unexpected and unusual”.


The tribunal had further issues with his account of his relationship with the other man and of coming to realise he was gay, which was “entirely bereft of any of the thoughts, feelings and emotions that are commonly experienced”.


Mr Justice O’Donnell said he was not at all satisfied the tribunal erred by making findings based on conjecture or stereotype. The findings proceeded from a careful consideration of the facts and by giving the applicant extensive opportunities to explain his position, he said.


He held that the tribunal’s decision was lawful.

One shot dead in Yunyoo in renewed communal clash,"A male adult has been killed with more than 10 houses torched in a renewed chieftaincy and land clash between two Konkomba factions at Gbingbani in the North East Region.


Confirming the incident to JoyNews, the District Chief Executive, Konlan Bitian, said the fighting started around midnight on Friday after unidentified armed men launched a complex attack.


""We were hit with the sad news this morning [Saturday] that the community is on fire again,"" the DCE revealed, adding that several houses had been burnt down.


According to the DCE, the men had deserted the community after the violence, leaving behind women and children.


He added that although police had been deployed to the area, there were reports that some armed men in Jejung, a village under Chereponi, were planning more attacks in Gbingbani.




""Just this morning, we had an intelligence that men are gathering in a nearby community, Jujung, in the Chereponi district to attack the Gbingbani community,"" Konlan alleged.


The District Chief Executive could not tell the immediate cause of the flare-up. However, he strongly believes it was linked to the longstanding chieftaincy and land disagreement between the feuding factions.


In March, tension spiralled out of control, leading to the first incident in which two persons died, and a large number of properties, including tractors and tipper trucks, were set on fire and obliterated.

24-year-old welder sentenced to 25 years in hard labour for robbery,"24-year-old Kwame Adjei has been sentenced to a term of twenty-five years in imprisonment in hard labour on his own plea.


The convict was a welder at Jasikan in the Oti region. The complainant, age 28 years, is a farmer and a part-time Okada rider resident at Dai-Konda in the republic of Togo.


 On the 22nd of June 2024 at about 3pm, the rider’s service was required by the accused to transport him to Kadjebi. Along the journey, it begun to rain but the accused insisted they continued in the rain.


Upon reaching a bushy area at Bogos junction between Kadjebi and Menuso on the Kadjebi-Nkwanta Highway, the accused poured powdered pepper into the face of the complainant.


According to the complainant, the powdered pepper blinded him causing him to stop abruptly.




Kofi Azorlenyo, the complainant said he quickly used his remote controller to the bike to lock it and run to safety.


The accused however succeeded in moving the motorbike away from the scene of incident.


The complainant later went to Menuso town where he raised alarm about the theft incident. A search party was dispatched to look for the motorbike.


The bike was found on a cocoa farm at Bogos Kope between Kadjebi and Menuso. The accused was also traced to Kadjebi and arrested at the Kadjebi main lorry station.









A search on him revealed the key to the stolen motorbike. He was handed over to the Kadjebi police.


 The police later organised an identification parade and the accused was identified as the perpetrator of the pepper spraying and theft incident.


The accused during investigations admitted to the crime and was charged and put before the Jasikan Circuit Court.


He was charged for robbery contrary to section 149 of the Criminal Offences Act 1960 (Act 29). His Honour Michael Jackson Abbey, the presiding judge at the court sentenced him on his own guilty plea to a prison term of twenty-five years in hard labour.




The case was prosecuted by ASP Seth Vincent Kpodo, Crime Officer for Jasikan Divisional Command.

Disregard the fake news; IGP is still at post  Police Service,"The Ghana Police Service has refuted reports suggesting that Inspector General of Police, Dr George Akuffo Dampare, has been instructed to proceed on leave and hand over his responsibilities to his deputy, Christian Tetteh Yohuno.


In an official press release dated June 30th and signed by ACP Grace Ansah-Akrofi, Director of Public Affairs, the Service said the report is inaccurate, and thus urged the public to dismiss it.


“We would like to urge the public to disregard this fake news and treat same with the contempt it deserves.”


The Inspector-General of Police is steadfast in fulfilling his duty to lead the Ghana Police Service, in accordance with the mandate bestowed upon him by the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

15-year old girl battles for her life after brutal attack by 21-yearold suspected rapist,"A fifteen-year-old girl is in critical condition at the Sogakope District Hospital following a brutal attack by a 21-year-old man who allegedly attempted to rape her.


The incident took place on Wednesday, June 26, in Dabala, in the South Tongu District of the Volta Region.


According to reports, the victim was conversing with a schoolmate behind their house in the evening when the suspect, armed with a sharp dagger, chased the male schoolmate away and demanded sex from the girl.


When she refused, he allegedly dragged her to a nearby bush and inflicted multiple cutlass wounds on her.


Despite being left semi-conscious, the courageous girl managed to crawl back home, where she was quickly rushed to the Sogakope District Hospital. She is currently receiving medical treatment.




Mr Ignatius Blebu, the victim's father, recounted the horrifying incident to Joy News.


“On Wednesday night, my daughter was in her room when one of her classmates came looking for her. She came out to meet him, and they went to the back of our house where there is a summer hut. They sat under it to chat. While they were sitting there, another guy named Godsway approached with a cutlass.


When her friend saw him, he ran away. Immediately, the man with the cutlass caught my daughter and demanded that she let him sleep with her or he would kill her. My daughter said no to him, and as soon as she refused, he dragged her from the summer hut to the forest and began to cut her with the cutlass. He repeatedly demanded that she allow him to sleep with her, threatening to kill her if she didn't comply.


He added “My daughter continued to refuse, saying she would rather die than let him sleep with her. This enraged him, and he mercilessly cut her on her back, face, and all over her body.




Despite her severe injuries, she managed to stand up and run, with the attacker following her. She eventually escaped and made it home, where she collapsed. We immediately took her to the roadside and got a motorbike to rush her to the hospital.”


Mr Blebu continued, ""We later discovered that the attacker was named Godsway. We reported the case to the police, and the youth in the town went to find him. They eventually caught him and brought him to the police station.

Ahanta West: 60-year-old man accused of attempting to kill people spiritually burnt to death,"Six individuals have been apprehended by the Ahanta West Municipal Police Command in the Western Region for allegedly setting ablaze a 60-year-old man, Isaac Ansah, in a community known as Achonwa.


According to Channel One TV, the tragic event on Thursday, June 27th, 2024, occurred after a mob responded to allegations by a local fetish priest from the Achonwa community.


The priest had informed elders of the community that Isaac Ansah had supposedly presented the names of 14 community members to him to be killed for sacrifice.


Before this incident, Ansah had been residing in the community for over two years due to an earlier accusation of spiritually causing the death of a resident.







Mr Frank Eshun, the nephew of the late Ansah, who recounted the incident to Channel One News, mentioned that among the six individuals arrested were community figures such as Nana Ojandi, the Caretaker Chief, Godfred Cudjoe, the Assemblyman, the Fetish Priest, the Chief Fisherman, and two others.




Mr Eshun elaborated that the mob violence resulting in his uncle's tragic death occurred shortly after a meeting between Ansah and town elders, which ended without a resolution. This prompted anger among residents who attacked him.


“The Chief (Caretaker Chief) and the Assemblyman had a grand durbar to meet the community members to decide what they have to do with my uncle. They also called the Fetish Priest to narrate what had happened. That was where he said my uncle had written some 14 names for him to kill them.







“So when they called my uncle, he told them that the names he sent to the Fetish Priest were rather to soften their heart to allow him to come back to the community as he was already serving banishment from the community for an incident that happened some two years ago.


“It was just for the Priest to change their mind to forget the issue to allow him to come back to the community to do his work but he didn’t tell him to kill anyone. They didn’t listen to him at all and so the youth of the community gathered, immediately captured him, tied him with ropes, stoned him and finally burnt him with used car tyres and petrol,” he said.




He said the family has been devastated by the tragic death of his uncle and strongly called for justice to be served.


“It’s painful. When I went there and saw the remains of my uncle, I have not been able to eat anything since, because I saw dogs and birds eating his remains. So I feel very bad. We need the prosecution of those people because if this even happened, it is not for you to use the law anyhow you want. There is law in the country and everyone must abide by the law. So we are pleading with the state to prosecute them“, he called.


The body of 60-year-old Isaac Ansah has been taken to the mortuary for an autopsy, and his family is hopeful that they can soon lay him to rest peacefully.

GBA president calls for enhanced security and safety of judges,"The President of the Ghana Bar Association (GBA), Mr Yaw Acheampong Boafo, has emphasised the need for improved safety and security of judges and the entire judiciary, particularly ahead of the 2024 general election.


Speaking at the remembrance service for the Martyrs of the Rule of Law, held at the Cavalry Baptist Church in Accra on Sunday, June 30, he underscored the heightened stakes during this critical period.


“We cannot afford to witness and deal with similar acts of threats, intimidation, violence, vigilantism, and lawlessness, which can affect the peace and stability of Ghana and our general cast to consolidate our democratic and economic development. Yet still, the marking of a day like this should serve as a constant reminder of the need for the state government, and the management of the judicial service to enhance the security and safety of judges at all levels of the judiciary.


Reflecting on recent events, Mr Acheampong highlighted a chilling incident in Kenya where a principal magistrate was fatally attacked in open court. He urged Ghanaian authorities to learn from this tragic experience and fortify the protection of judicial officers.


Mr Acheampong also lamented the inadequate security infrastructure in many Ghanaian courts, particularly at lower levels.







He cited the absence of court warrant offices and insufficient equipment as critical deficiencies jeopardising the safety of judges and court personnel.


“Some few years ago, Justice Senyo Dzamefe of the Court of Appeal, as then President of the Association of Judges and Magistrates of Ghana, made a call for the installation of circuit television cameras at the courts to ensure surveillance of criminals and unscrupulous persons who may want to target judges and other court users.


“The GBA finds that thoughtful and implores upon government and management of the judicial service, that safe and secure judiciary is essential in ensuring that our judges and magistrates and court staff work and discharge their legal duties and go about the resolution of their cases without fear of favour and upholding the rule of law.""


Mr Acheampong assured Ghanaian judges of unwavering solidarity and urged them to uphold the rule of law with integrity and professionalism. “Please continue to remain resolute and fearless in the discharge of judicial oath of doing justice to all manner of persons without fear or favour, or affection or ill will and with integrity, and professionalism.”




In closing, he called upon judges to resist undue influences and biases, pledging the GBA's commitment to supporting their pursuit of justice by Ghana's Constitution and laws.


The remembrance service honoured the sacrifices of the three judges who were killed in 1982 for defending the rule of law.

Spare the judiciary of your divisive politics- GBA tells politicians,"The President of the Ghana Bar Association (GBA), Yaw Acheampong Boafo, has called for an end to the politicisation of Ghana's judiciary.


His remarks come amid the increasing political commentary surrounding high-profile court cases in the country.


At the remembrance service for the Martyrs of the Rule of Law, held at the Cavalry Baptist Church in Accra on Sunday, June 30, Mr Boafo lamented the current trend of framing judicial matters through a political lens.


“We must spare the judiciary our divisive partisanship. It is sad that public commentary relative to cases of public interest pending in court has taken on political colouration,” he said on Sunday.


Mr Boafo reiterated a point he made at the 2023 Annual General Conference of the Ghana Bar Association, emphasising that the judiciary operates independently of political affiliations.




""There is no training module at the judicial training school known as NPP judge, NDC judge, CPP judge for anyone to tag a judge as NPP, NDC, and CPP. There is only one judiciary established in Chapter 11 of the 1992 Constitution,"" he stated emphatically.


“I want to place on record that at no stage of the interview and evaluation courses of an appointment to any level of the judiciary is the political affiliation or leanings of an applicant a requirement.""


The remembrance service honoured the sacrifices of the three judges who were killed in 1982 for defending the rule of law.


Mr Boafo, therefore, urged individuals who assign political colours to judges to desist from the act in order not to “lead to the martyrdom of any judge.”

Youre better than a pack of cooked rice; dont let politicians use you for violence  GBA to youth,"The Ghana Bar Association (GBA) has expressed concern about the pockets of violent incidents recently recorded during some electoral processes towards the main election in December.


The GBA warns that such incidents are not a positive indication as the country approaches the general election.


Yaw Acheampong Boafo, President of the GBA, urged the youth to remain purposeful and resist being used by politicians as instruments of violence. 


He encouraged them to engage in activities that would improve their lives and the lives of their families rather than put them in danger.


Mr Boafo made these remarks at the remembrance service for the Martyrs of the Rule of Law, held at the Cavalry Baptist Church on Sunday, June 30.




“To the youth who are invariably exploited and manipulated by some political actors, I urge you to be purposely in life. Channel your energy into meaningful ventures and not be misled by unscrupulous politicians to engage in acts that destabilise our nation.”


“I dare say, you’re worth more than some few Ghana Cedis and a pack of cooked rice,” he said. 


He also called on Ghanaians to safeguard the country's democratic achievements and promote the economic well-being of all citizens.


“The 2024 General election is a little over five months away. It is not in doubt that the stakes are even higher.”




“We cannot afford to deal with similar acts of threats, violence, intimidation and vigilantism which can affect the peace and stability of Ghana and our general quest to consolidate our democratic gains and accelerate our economic development,” he added.

WASH expert urges focus on grey water to mitigate public health risk,"Provost of the College of Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Prof. Kwabena Biritwum Nyarko, is emphasising the critical need to address grey water management to prevent health and environmental consequences.


Speaking at his professorial inaugural lecture, he called on the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources to integrate Grey water Management in water and sanitation programming.


Greywater which refers to wastewater from our kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry sources is polluted, posing substantial environmental and health risks to communities.


According to the 2020 Population and Housing Census, 70% of the population disposes of their grey water by dumping it on the ground or in the street, while 27% allow it to flow into drains or gutters or directly throw it into these drains.


Again, 11% channel their greywater into a soakage pit (soakaway), and only 2% discharge greywater through the sewerage system.




At his lecture which is under the topic: “Universal access to water and sanitation services: A myth or reality?” he was worried grey water “has not received attention in Ghana.”


He further stated his research activities on grey water haven’t been encouraging.


“Our findings revealed the following: 36% of the average water consumed ends up as grey water. Grey water is polluted and requires treatment before disposal. Greywater contains micropollutants at levels higher than expected.


He added: “With less than 5% of Ghana’s population having access to sewerage systems, our reliance on onsite sanitation, which fails to address greywater challenges, is a significant concern. Untreated grey water.




“Universal access to water and sanitation will be meaningless unless greywater management is made an integral component.


“Achieving universal access to water and sanitation without addressing greywater issues will be meaningless.""


On the household level, Prof. Biritwum Nyarko believes “the least we can do is to use soakage pit or soak away.”

Dont let Ghana Publishing Company collapse; commit resources to it  Otumfuo,"Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, the Asantehene, has urged the government to allocate more resources towards revitalizing the Ghana Publishing Company Limited.


During a meeting with board members at the Manhyia palace, Otumfuo emphasized the crucial role of local publishing industries in preserving cultural heritage and fostering economic growth.


The Ghana Publishing Company Limited, once a thriving entity, has faced years of inactivity due to financial challenges.


Efforts are currently underway to restore its former prominence, with stringent measures being implemented.


Otumfuo called on policymakers to introduce supportive measures aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the publishing company.




He highlighted the importance of strategic investments and initiatives that would enable the company to regain its stature and contribute meaningfully to Ghana's publishing sector.


“We have left the company to collapse, but we can revive it and I am hopeful you are making progress since you are a limited liability company”.


“This is an important company because it gazettes everything. If the government supports them with deliberate policies and some percentage of government resources, I believe it will help develop the company,” the Asante King said.

"IGP leaked tape: Supt. Asare, Supt. Gyebi caught lying, committee cites them for contempt","The Parliamentary committee which probed the leaked tape regarding the alleged scheme by some senior police officers to remove the Inspector-General of Police from office has cited two of the officers who appeared before the committee for Contempt of Parliament after they told lies to the committee under oath. 


The committee in its report presented to Parliament said the two officers Supt. George Lysander Asare and Supt. Emmanuel Eric Gyebi “Sought to undermine the authority of Parliament” by lying under oath in their responses to the committee. 


The committee has therefore referred them to the Privileges Committee of Parliament for appropriate action to be taken.





“Supt.  Gyebi during his testimony under oath, on 31st August, 2023 denied ever speaking to Chief Bugri Naabu directly on his phone or on the phone of Supt Asare. However, when he appeared before the Committee again on 10th  October, 2023, he changed his earlier testimony and affirmed that he indeed spoke to Chief Bugri Naabu on phone.”


The Committee further said: “Supt. Asare also in answering a question under oath posed by Hon. Peter Lanchene Toobu on 4th September, 2023 on whether he was present when Chief Bugri Naabu spoke to Supt. Emmanuel Gyebi on phone, he responded in the negative. However, he changed his initial response to this question to the affirmative when he appeared before the Committee on 10th October, 2023.”




When he first appeared before the committee, Supt. Gyebi denied his involvement in the conspiracy by flatly denying that he had ever spoken to Chief Bugri Naabu after the former NPP Northern Regional Chairman had said the two had spoken and agreed to present their misgivings about the IGP to the President. 


Supt. Asare in his further testimony before the committee, also denied the allegations that Supt. Gyebi spoke with Bugri Naabu on his (Asare) phone and went further to call Bugri Naabu a liar; an allegation Bugri took very strong exception to. 


The two Police officers however made sharp U-turns after Chief Bugri Naabu presented the longer version of the tape to the committee which had the conversation between Supt. Gyebi and Chief Bugri Naabu.


The committee therefore recommended that the two be given stiff punishment for their conduct. 




“The Committee is of the view that Supt. Asare and Supt Gyebi appeared to have acted in contempt of Parliament pursuant to Order 30 of the Standing Orders of Parliament (2000) as revised by Order 13 )1( of the Standing Orders of Parliament (2024). In this regard, the Committee is of the opinion that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee for appropriate action”. 


Three senior police officers, COP Alex George Mensah, Supt. George Lysander Asare and Supt. Emmanuel Eric Gyebi were heard on a leaked tape allegedly plotting the removal of the Inspector-General of Police with the former Northern regional chairman of the New Patriotic Party, Daniel Bugri Naabu. 


The tape was recorded by Bugri Naabu who confirmed taping their conversation as he was shocked that serving police officers will seek to undermine the authority of the IGP in such a brazen manner and wanted to report their conduct to the president.

Tax policies on products with negative health impacts beneficial  FDA,"The Chief Executive of the Food and Drugs Authority, Delese Mimi Darko, says tax policies on products like tobacco and alcohol, with negative public health consequences, are beneficial.


“The taxes advance health equity, prevent disease, save lives, and generate revenue for the general budget. These funds can also support Universal Health Coverage,” she stated.


Madam Darko remarked at the first National Forum on Tobacco Taxation on the theme: “Strengthening the Evidence for Effective Tobacco Taxation for Health and Development in Ghana.”


It was organised by the Vision for Alternative Development – Ghana (VALD-Ghana) in Accra.


The forum was aimed at seeking feasible recommendations through which Ghana’s tobacco taxation could be comprehensively aligned with global standards, particularly those outlined by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).




The goal was to address the social, health, environmental and economic impact of tobacco use.


Madam Darko said the passage of the Excise Duty Amendment Act, 2023 (Act 1096), marked a significant milestone in tobacco control in Ghana, transitioning from an ad-valorem tax structure to a mixed tax structure.


“Raising taxes on tobacco products increases their price, making them less affordable and preventing youth initiation,” she noted, adding that; “Article ‘6’ of the WHO FCTC encourages countries to implement price and tax measures, and Ghana is dedicated to this effort,” she said.


She said tackling tobacco use globally was a priority within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that controlling the product was crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG Target 3.4.




The target aims to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one-third by 2030, while Target ‘3.a’ supports the objective by calling for the strengthening of the implementation of the WHO FCTC.


The Chief Executive stated: “Beyond health, tobacco control reduces poverty and inequalities, strengthens the economy, and promotes sustainable development.”Madam Darko said the FDA was committed to fully supporting the continuous implementation of the Excise Duty Amendment Act, 2023 (Act 1096) to reduce tobacco use and save lives in Ghana.The Deputy Commissioner of the Ghana Revenue Authority, Dr Charles Addai, said the Authority was implementing all the excise taxes, which were called “sin taxes” to raise revenue and help reduce the consumption of harmful products.


He said one of the major laws being used by the GRA was the Excise Duty (Amendment) Act 2023 (Act 1108).


“The objective of the Act is to raise revenue, mitigate the harmful effect of excisable products, and conform to ECOWAS protocol; and the major changes in the Act were; an increase in the tax rates, introduced e-cigarettes, and introduced mixed excise tax regime (specific and ad-valorem,” he stated.

"Nigerians surprised I chose to live here, while they leave  Swiss married to Igbo","Janine Udogu is more than a wife to the people of Isuofia in Aguata, Anambra. She could pass for a pearl. And to millions across Nigeria, especially the Igbo, Janine, popularly known as Nwanyiocha has become a delight.


She wears the traditional title – ‘Lolo Anyanwu Ututu I’, conferred on her by the people of Isuofia.


An encounter with Janine would leave no one in doubt as to why she was crowned with such title. ‘Anyanwu Ututu’ means a rising morning sun. Such sun usually would rise gently, permeate mildly and have a way of motivating for the day.


So also is Janine’s personality which could inspire the uninspired, and particularly her complexion which radiates both at dawn and in the dark of the night.


Her enchanting demeanour typifies the Igbo ancient name, Adadioramma, which implies the delight of all. Humble, elegant, modest, with an adventurous zest and uncommon love for the Igbo and Nigerian; Nwanyiocha today poses as an ambassador, as she goes about celebrating and promoting the Nigerian way of life, especially that of the Igbo.




In a chat with Saturday Vanguard, Janine narrates how it all started, the near-mystery that birthed a union that has lasted for over 12 years with kids, the initial concerns and the decision to relocate to Nigeria for residence.


How it started


On the evening of a fateful day in 2008, Janine had gone to a club in Switzerland, her land of birth, to unwind. There, she caught the fancy of a young Nigerian, Ezenwa Udogu, who approached her for exchange of phone contacts. But Janine would not oblige. She rather opted for a stand that could be considered complicated. “If God wants us to meet again, we will meet”; she responded. God did cause them to meet again two days later.


But Janine wasn’t done with her drama. “If God wants us to meet again, we will meet”; she repeated. Two weeks later, they met again. This time, she reluctantly yielded, since she couldn’t ‘stretch’ God any further. Janine said she wasn’t thinking of relationship then.


“I just didn’t feel like it was something for me to go into a relationship that time. I was feeling he might want something else, but of course, thereafter, I realised he already had all his papers”.




Marriage


Having accepted a relationship, Janine got married to Ezenwa in 2012, when they had a court marriage in Switzerland. In January 2014, they travelled to Isuofia to exchange marital vows in a church.At first, Janine didn’t see the celebration of Nigeria as a priority. She was just set out to love and cherish Ezenwa, her husband; and to find a way to navigate through the many horrible things said about Nigeria. But arriving here, she found out that it wasn’t as bad as it was painted outside. She therefore, decided to tell the story as an eye witness.


The realisation that many were eager to hear her story, however, fuelled her energy. The issue of living in Nigeria was part of an agreement Janine had with Ezenwa when they got married. The agreement was anchored on the need to enable their kids know their roots and blend. Last year, they took the bull by the horn and left Switzerland for residence in Nigeria.


According to her, “The story is one sided about Nigeria in Europe and in my country. What pushed me was when none of my family members wanted to attend my wedding in the village for fear of security issues and all the horrible stories they hear. I came here every year on holiday. The way I see Nigeria and the way it is seen outside, I felt there was need for somebody to change the narrative a bit. It’s not like I wanted to be active on social media, but when I realised people were eager to hear my story, I decided to use the platform to showcase how I see Nigeria.


Relocation to Nigeria


“It was part of the agreement when we got married that it would be a priority for us to bring up our kids in Nigeria, knowing their roots, their language. My husband was married before to a Swiss lady, and she never really encouraged him to bring his child home. And him being the first son, it was obvious that any other children should be here, at least to know their language, know where the house is in the village and all that.




We decided this will be our chance to come home because the kids are already a bit grown. Let them start school here and experience Nigeria for themselves, not just visiting. We spent a lot of money coming here every year, yet it was just visiting. The Swiss were a bit worried, concerning security, access to health care and all of that.


That made them to ask me, are you sure you really want to do this? For Nigerians, it was very difficult for some people to understand how I could want to live here when they are trying everything possible to get out of Nigeria. But that’s the issue of having multicultural children. In Switzerland, they call my kids black; when they come here, people call them Oyibo. I think it’s important for them to know both and be proud of it, to say – Yes, I’m black, yes I’m white.


Also, Ezenwa as a traditional Igbo man wants to grow old here in Nigeria. So, I also needed to have this reality check and know how it feels to live here, because it’s always nice when you come to a place for vacation. But, can you really love there?.


Ezenwa’s love


“What swept me off my feet was the genuineness and intensity of Ezenwa’s love for me. It was the greatest I had. He would do everything for me. He is the kind that pays so much attention to what somebody needs. When I need him, it doesn’t matter the time, he would drop everything. For him, it’s family first. And he just showed me this love that I had never received from anybody else. I never had any doubt about his love towards me. He loves my heart. The way he is there for me is same way I’m always there for him. We are best of friends. I love him for who he is and not what he has”.




One of the landmarks Janine established in Ezenwa’s compound in Isuofia is a mango tree she planted years ago which now supplies fruits to the family and neighbours. This and some other traits have earned Janine what some would describe as ‘street credibility’. She is loved by the street.


She revealed that she treasures the strength of Umuada (an association of daughters married outside their home) in adjudicating matters in their maiden home.


Many parents of Igbo extraction seem to be competing in raising their kids in English Language and trampling upon their mother tongue. But a Swiss Nigerian is bent on ensuring that her kids become fluent in their native Igbo Language and immersed in their culture and Nigerian way of life. This is the irony. It is believed that Janine’s path will inspire a greater love in Nigerians for the Nigerian.

Three poachers arrested at Mole National Park,"Three suspected poachers have been arrested by rangers at the Mole National Park in the Savannah Region.


They were allegedly hunting in the reserve.


The suspects named as Saaka Karim, 26; Abdulai Adam, 25 and Ahmed Fatawu, 23 were apprehended on Thursday, June 27.


Two other suspects managed to escape arrest in the forest reserve.


The rangers were on their routine patrols in the park when they spotted multiple footprints and traced to apprehend the suspects.




Confirming the incident to Graphic Online’s Mohammed Fugu, the Law Enforcement Officer of the Mole National Park, Alfred Kofi Bara said all the suspects were farmers and natives of Larabanga, a fringe community of the park.


He said a preliminary investigation showed that the suspects entered the park through the Kananto – Grupe stretch and intended to spend several days in the reserve to hunt various species of animals.


“It would interest you that, Saaka Karim who is one of the suspects entered the park on the 18th of April, 2020 to poach and in the course of pursuing to arrest him, he shot at a staff by the name Haruna Hashim who sustained serious injury on a shoulder.”


The suspect was arraigned on April 20, 2020, and was subsequently fined GH¢1,920.00.

I look younger after leaving presidential villa  Former First Lady of Nigeria,"Patience Jonathan, the wife of former President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has said since leaving the presidential villa, she has become younger.


She added that she would never return to the villa as the stress was too much.


Patience Jonathan said these while delivering a speech on ‘Public relations, value reorientation, and economic transformation’.


The former first lady was speaking, on Thursday, at a colloquium organised to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, NIPR.


Patience said: “The stress of Nigeria is too much. If you call (on) me now for the villa, I won’t go there. I won’t.




“Don’t you see how young I am? The stress is so much. The stress of Nigeria is so much.


“If God manages to bring you out of it, you should glorify God and thank him. It is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.


“He has taken you there once, why do you want to go there again? Me, I won’t go ooo.”


On 2015 presidential election


Commenting on the 2015 presidential election, which her husband lost to Muhammadu Buhari, Patience Jonathan said she did not encourage Goodluck to hand on to power.




She said she did not urge her husband to stay in office after he lost at the polls.


According to her, Jonathan “willingly relinquished without a fight.


“When we failed the election, I was with him (Jonathan). We were in the room when we were told you had lost.


“I did not whisper to him that he must stay. Because we will shed blood. Innocent people will die.




“And who will be the person we don’t know. It might be you, it might be me. It might be my brother or sister.


“We don’t need anybody to die. We’re brothers and sisters. We are one country,” the former First Lady added.

Physician assistant advocates for medical diagnosis before spiritual remedies,"A Physician Assistant at the Pleasant Medical Centre at Ashaiman Middle East, Rocky Tettedzie, has advised the public to seek proper medical diagnosis before turning to spiritual remedies. 


Mr Tettedzie emphasised the importance of visiting medical treatment centres first to identify any potential health issues and the needed intervention.


Speaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA), he acknowledged the role of spirituality and personal beliefs in personal healthcare decisions, stressing, however, that health institutions were equipped to detect problems through laboratory tests.


Mr Tettedzie stated that clinical conditions could sometimes be diagnosed without lab tests and in such cases, if lab investigations yielded negative results but the patient remained symptomatic, treatment might still be administered, often resulting in the patient's improvement.


He noted that when no medical cause can be identified, healthcare providers would explain to patients that health encompassed not only the absence of disease but also mental and physical well-being.




”While medical centres do not typically direct patients to seek spiritual remedies, there are rare instances where a clinician with spiritual insight might advise so, nonetheless, medical practice prioritises evidence-based treatments,” he said.


The physician assistant pointed out that some conditions, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be completely cured but could be managed to improve the patient's quality of life and prevent further complications. 


He urged people to avoid prioritising spiritual interventions over medical consultations, recommending a proper diagnosis first, if no medical issues were found, they could then explore spiritual avenues, stressing that the Holy Spirit is accessible to everyone for prayer and intervention, not just spiritual leaders.


He shared some experiences of patients with breast cancer, cervical cancer, hypertension, and diabetes who sought treatment at religious prayer camps. 




He said these patients often report to the hospitals very late when faced with severe complications or when their conditions have worsened.


Mr. Tettedzie clarified that no doctor would prevent a patient from seeking spiritual health, but medical professionals advised that individuals must first visit health institutions for early diagnosis, adding that clinics might have varied diagnoses, therefore what is undetected at one centre could be identified at another for treatment.

Menuso residents appeal for telephone network connectivity,"Residents of Menuso, a farming community in the Kadjebi District of the Oti Region, have appealed to mobile communications companies and the government to link them to the mobile network connectivity highway.


They said the border community needs vital facilities to make communication easy, especially in times of terrorist attacks.


They said the continued absence of the facility in the community put them at risk.


They said they have to climb trees and anthills in search of a network to make or receive calls when the need arises and that this deprived them of accessing vital information on time and derailed their business efforts.


The appeal was through Mr Baba Abdul Rahman, a former Assemblyman for Menuso Electoral Area at a community meeting with the Police and Ghana Immigration Service Personnel from the Menuso Border Post.




Mr Smith Tagba, Headman for Agbo Kordzi supported the call and said now that terrorist attacks in the sub-region are increasingly becoming a worrying trend, reporting attacks on the border community to the security agencies would be difficult because of the poor network connectivity.


He said the community members are living in fear and panic due to the absence of the facility in the town.


Mr Tagba, also a former Assemblyman for the area, said all attempts to bring authorities to act on the issue have failed.


He thus renewed their appeal for the installation of a mast as any attack on the community would be disastrous.

"Cement price regulation shows governments malicious intent, says Baba Jamal","Former Member of Parliament for Akwatia, Baba Jamal, has criticised the Akufo-Addo government, claiming that the initiative by Trade and Industry Minister. K.T. Hammond to regulate cement prices is a sign of the government's malicious intent towards Ghanaians.


Speaking on Channel One TV on Saturday, June 29, Baba Jamal addressed the sharp increase in cement prices, emphasising that the decision to draft a legislative instrument to control these prices must have gone through the cabinet.


He argued that at that stage, the proposal should have been withdrawn. However, due to what he perceives as the government's wickedness, the measure was allowed to proceed.


“You cannot lay any legislative instrument without it going to cabinet and that is why the whole NPP machinery is wicked towards Ghanaians. It can easily create shortages because manufacturers will simply stop producing and so it is important for the government to rather look at the factors causing cement prices to rise.""


“What occasioned the price hikes should be looked at and what can possibly be done to cushion cement manufacturers and this is what the government must be thinking about because how do you want someone to produce at a higher cost and sell at a lower price?.”




The Minister for Trade and Industry, K.T Hammond has submitted a proposed legislative instrument to Parliament to regulate cement pricing in the country.


However, the former Akwatia MP, Baba Jamal, urged the government to withdraw the L. I to prevent an escalation of the situation.


“I will advise the government to withdraw this LI and this must be taken seriously because what is happening in Kenya is serving as an eye-opener to a lot of countries and we don’t want what happened in Kenya to happen in Ghana, so the L. I must be withdrawn.”

"Ghana, Cyprus initiate political consultations","Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides has hosted Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Ms Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, in the national capital, Nicosia, to work towards establishing a framework for political consultations between the two nations.


The framework is intended to facilitate cooperation in areas of trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, and tourism, and promote smooth visa protocols.


At a meeting held at the Cypriot Foreign Ministry’s Headquarters, Madam Botchwey informed Dr Konstantinos Kombos, Cypriot Foreign Minister and his team, of many opportunities being offered by the burgeoning Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.


“We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I will recommend a visit by a Cypriot Business Mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,” she stated.


The two leaders also discussed multilateral issues including the United Nations, and the future of the Commonwealth, the 56-member organisation, which Madam Botchwey has offered herself to lead as its General-Secretary when Heads of Governments meet in October in the Pacific Island of Samoa.




Her candidacy has received strong bipartisan support in Ghana.


Cypriot Foreign Minister, Dr Kombos, commended Ghana for her position on issues of international law during her two-year tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023.


“The Commonwealth is a powerful organisation, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,” Dr Kombos said.


The Commonwealth Member States generate over $13 trillion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually.




Ms Botchwey, in response, said: “We must make sure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members.”


She said the Commonwealth must be felt beyond election monitoring and the Commonwealth Games.


“The Commonwealth must support young people; we must train them in skills and provide them with financial support for innovation and start-ups to stem the tide of illegal migration,” she said.


Ms Botchwey, one of Africa’s leading diplomats, has made the issues concerning the future of young people in the Commonwealth key thematic topics for her candidacy.




More than 60 per cent of the 2.6 billion people in the Commonwealth are under 30 years old.


Although most Commonwealth countries were former British colonies, other countries like Rwanda, Mozambique, Togo and now-suspended Gabon without pre-independence ties with Britain, had joined, which, Madam Botchwey said, demonstrated the organisation’s importance.


Earlier, Cypriot President Christodoulides stated that his country shared Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, especially in the areas of trade and investment.Trade volumes between Ghana and Cyprus currently stood at $1.8 million as of 2022.

HIV: More babies getting infected despite PMTCT intervention,"The National Aids Control Programme (NACP) says there is an increase in HIV mother-to-child infections despite the implementation of the Mother-to Child Transmission (PMTCT).


Dr Stephen Ayisi-Addo, Programme Manager, the National Aids Control Programme (NACP), said the situation was due to a lack of testing and adherence to medication by pregnant women, hence the continuous infection from mothers to their babies.


At the 2023 dissemination of National HIV estimates, Dr Ayisi Addo expressed concern that facilities continue to record newborn babies infected with the virus, which is a transmission from the mother to the baby.


The Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission PMTCT) is one of the interventions instituted by NACP, Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) and partners to ensure the prevention of HIV transmission from mothers to their babies.


With the intervention, pregnant women would have to get tested for HIV at an Antenatal care service and those found positive would be put on medication to protect the baby from getting infected.




The National HIV estimation showed that 12,108 mothers, aged 15 to 49 years are receiving Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) treatment.


It also indicated that 13, 445, mothers needed PMTCT between the ages of 15 to 49 years.


He noted that a lot of the babies contracting HIV from their mothers were babies from mothers who missed testing during ANC, saying, “We are talking covering about 90 per cent of all ANC attendance for HIV testing, so those who come in late do not get the treatment to prevent the mother from transmission to the baby.


“We need to be able to improve the ANC testing coverage. We need to improve so that people will have supervised delivery on their routine services offered when pregnant women come to the facility,” he added.




The Programme Manager also indicated that lack of adherence to taking their medication by HIV-infected mothers was causing transmission from mothers to their newborns.


He said even with those tested and identified, not all of them get the anti-retroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission.


Besides, out of the about 6,000 PMTC facilities, just 730 facilities were delivering ARV.


Dr Ayisi Addo said at facilities where there was no PMTC coverage, pregnant women would have to be transferred to other facilities for such services, but they refuse to go due to transportation issues, hence, the new strategy to decentralise antiretroviral therapy across all centres.




He said postnatal transmission was also occurring due to exposure to breastfeeding.


As part of the interventions, the national response programme instituted strict infant feeding guidelines for HIV-positive mothers to prevent transmission.


However, some mothers are unable to adhere to the guidelines and such gaps are contributing to the continuous records of transmission.


The Programme Manager acknowledged that the infant feeding guidelines for persons living with HIV had been reduced due to the unavailability of trained service providers to educate the mothers as they missed the appropriate feeding procedure, getting their babies exposed to the virus.




“It is our aspiration and determination to make sure that we address all these issues and improve on strategic interventions to improve on the figures and reduce mother-to-child transmission to at least 2 per cent, which is an elimination target.


Dr Stephen Atuahene, Director General of the GAC, said strict adherence to treatment was key as it suppressed the virus and would help to avoid perinatal transmission.


He said it was important for HIV-positive women to achieve viral suppression before getting pregnant and necessary to maintain the suppression status, saying, “It is also the responsibility of the mother to adhere to treatment, maintain viral suppression status and avoid transmission.


“As long as you can do that, you have a better chance of averting transmission to your baby and so adherence is very crucial to all persons living with HIV and taking the medication. This is so important for mothers because every woman will want to have a healthy baby and therefore you have to avoid any risk that will expose your child to infection.”

2023 RTI Report: 322 institutions submit annual reports to RTI Commission  Information Minister,"The Right to Information (RTI) Commission in 2023 received the annual reports of 322 out of an expected 683 institutions, Fatimatu Abubakar, Information Minister, told Parliament on Friday.That, she said, was unacceptable.


Presenting the 2023 RTI Report to the House, the Information Minister said the Ministry strongly urged the RTI Commission to impose administrative penalties against public institutions that failed, according to Section 71(2)(6) of the RTI Act, 2019.


She said of the complying 322 institutions, 173 received applications for information; adding that those institutions in total received 1,749 requests.


“Mr Speaker, the successful implementation of the RTI Law in Ghana partly depends on the demand for access to information by individuals, institutions, or groups. By Section 1 of Act 989, a person has the right to information and may apply for access to that information,” she stated.


‘Citizens need to understand, Mr Speaker, that in some limited circumstances as outlined between sections 5 to 17 of Act 989, public institutions have a right to exempt some classes of information from access under this Act.”




Madam Abubakar said the RTI Act, 2019 had clearly identified and classified some information as exempt, which called for safeguards, including those related to national security, public safety and/or individual privacy.


She said the RTI Commission, however, as an independent and impartial body, had also been resourced to deal with any unwarranted denials by public institutions.


The Minister indicated that the Ghana Revenue Authority processed the highest number of requests, amounting to 115.


Out of the 1,749 requests received by the various public institutions, 1,225 were approved by the information officers of the public institutions representing 70 per cent of the total number of applications received.




The Minister said the total number of applications rejected for varied reasons was 281 by the various public institutions, representing 16 per cent of the total requests.


She noted that reasons cited for rejecting requests include exempt information and information not in the custody of the public institution.


She said 42 of the requests were transferred to other institutions for processing, 20 were deferred, 19 were partially granted and 162 were referred.


She informed the House that work would soon be completed on the Legislative Instrument (LI) for the RTI Act.




Mr Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, the Majority Leader and Leader of Government Business in Parliament, who commended the Information Minister for the timely presentation of the 2023 RTI Report, reiterated the government’s commitment to accountability and transparency.


Mr Kwame Governs Agbodza, the Minority Chief Whip and National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament (MP) for Adaklu, commended the Minister for complying with the time frame for the submission of the RTI Report to the House.


Mr Samuel Okudjeto Ablakwa, NDC MP for North Tongu, who said it took the nation more than 20 years to pass the RTI Bill into law, also commended President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for assenting to the RTI Bill.


Mr Frank Annoh-Dompreh, the Majority Chief Whip and New Patriotic Party (NPP) MP for Nsawam-Adoagyiri lauded the Yagbonwura and the Wa Naa for donating parcels of lands to the Information Ministry towards the construction of regional offices of the RTI Commission in the Savannah and Upper West regions.

"Government to introduce strategies to retain medical professionals, Says Health Minister","The Minister for Health, Dr Bernard Okoe Boye, has outlined several measures to be implemented to address the growing exodus of Ghanaian medical professionals seeking opportunities abroad.


This follows urgent calls from Ghanaian medical professionals for government intervention to halt the mass departure of nurses and other essential practitioners, which is straining the country's healthcare system. 


In 2023 alone, nearly 4,000 nurses left Ghana for Europe and America in search of better job prospects.


Stakeholders are increasingly concerned that this trend will lead to a critical shortage of healthcare professionals if not urgently addressed. Dentists, in particular, are among those leaving the country in significant numbers.


The Dean of the KNUST School of Medicine and Dentistry, Prof Akwasi Antwi-Kusi, has urged the government to promptly introduce initiatives to counteract this troubling trend, noting the already limited number of dentists in the country.




“According to the Ghana Nurses and Midwives Association, nearly 4,000 nurses left Ghana for Europe and America in 2023 for better jobs. Without equivocation, one of the critical challenges the health sector will face in the next decade is a shortage of essential healthcare workers.”


“If the ongoing trend is not checked, it will pose significant challenges to the provision of quality and accessible healthcare for all. I am quite optimistic that the Ghana Dental Association and other professional bodies in the country are thinking through how to prevent such phenomenon in their ranks.”


In response, Dr Okoe Boye assured that the Ministry of Health is committed to tackling the various challenges facing dental services and other pressing issues within the healthcare sector.


“One of the things that the ministry is going to promote and sponsor has to do with partnerships, MoUs between the training centres and the let’s say the district facilities, the health centres and possibly even the CHPS compounds.”




“I think as professionals who always want to improve or increase our knowledge, we are comfortable when we are given logbooks that say that as part of your training at Komfo Anokye go to a particular district for some one month as part of the training. So, if we fashion this very well and the relationship between the Ghana Health Service facilities, most of the government facilities outside the teaching hospitals are under Dr Kumah Aboagye.”


“If we can have MoUs between these facilities and the teaching hospitals or the regional hospitals or the big centres where dentists are comfortable to practice, then through this route, we’ll find a way to make sure that every Ghanaian gets to have an experience with the dentist. And so, I believe MoUs is the way to go.""


“The second strategy or policy would be to work together with GDA, Ghana Education Service, and the teaching hospitals so that we can increase the numbers that we train annually.”

Parliament forms committee to consider pension scheme for MPs,"Following concerns raised about the welfare of former Members of Parliament (MPs), Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Andrew Asiamah Amoako, has established an eight-member ad hoc committee. 


This committee's mandate is to investigate the feasibility of implementing a pension scheme specifically tailored for MPs.


The decision to form this committee was prompted by recommendations put forth by both the Minority and Majority Chief Whips during a tribute session in memory of the late MP for Talensi, John Akologu Tia. 


The recognition of MPs' welfare issues during this session spurred the initiative to address their pension concerns.


Presiding over parliamentary proceedings on Friday, Andrew Asiamah Amoako set a two-week deadline for the committee to deliver their findings and recommendations to the house. 




“Honourable members, I think this is very important for all of us. So a committee has been set up and looking at the members that have been assembled to look into it, I think we can be rest assured that they will come out with something good for us.”


“So, we thank the members and we hope that they work out expeditiously for us.”

Election 2024: NDC leadership appears wobbly  Adu Asare,"A former National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament (MP) for the Adentan constituency, Kwadwo Adu Asare, has voiced concerns about the current state of the party as the December elections draw near.


Mr Adu Asare emphasised that he anticipates a higher level of enthusiasm from the party, especially in this critical year of campaigning.


His comments reflect a desire for more vigour and momentum within the NDC's efforts.


In an interview with Citi FM on Friday, June 28, Mr Adu Asare responded to inquiries about the party's performance. He highlighted areas where the party fell short of his expectations.


Despite his concerns, Mr Adu Asare remains hopeful. He expressed optimism that the situation is likely to improve as the elections approach.




“Sometimes your party leadership has a way of demonstrating the strength of the organisation very well. I think that there are some wobbly aspects of it but hopefully, with time they get better… I personally have a certain view vis-a-vis what used to exist before especially in an election year and all of that,” he stated.


He further expressed his anticipation for more vigour, especially considering the experiences of 2020, given his position at the nerve centre of the party.


“I expect a bit of zest, especially coming from the experiences of 2020 because some of us [were] at the nerve centre,” he added.

"Bawumias choice of Opoku Prempeh not surprising, makes political sense  Osae-Kwapong","Political analyst and research fellow at the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Dr John Osae-Kwapong, has endorsed the proposal of Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, also known as NAPO, as Dr Mahamudu Bawumia's running mate, describing it as a prudent decision.


In an interview with Channel One TV on Saturday, June 29, Dr Osae-Kwapong expressed the view that the selection of Dr Opoku Prempeh was not unexpected, considering the widespread support for his candidacy from influential quarters.


Dr Osae-Kwapong emphasised that both Dr Bawumia and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) leadership are well aware of the capabilities and contributions of the Member of Parliament for Manhyia South. 


He highlighted the strategic advantages that Dr Opoku Prempeh brings to the political landscape, citing his track record and influence within the party.


“After some time, I got the impression that there were active attempts by certain key voices to highlight the fact that he [NAPO] would be a strong candidate to partner with Bawumia in the upcoming elections, so I wasn’t particularly surprised when the announcement was made that his name was submitted to NEC for consideration.




“Every presidential candidate selects their running mate, I believe, being guided by two key things; the political dividends that they believe the candidate can bring to their campaign and then also the governance dividends.”


“When you put everything together, the choice makes sense and I can also see that this is the choice that the vice president thinks is a choice that will help him make a case for a Bawumia presidency and if he wins, this is a choice that can help him govern,” Dr Osae-Kwapong added.

Majority caucus backs Opoku-Prempeh as Bawumias running mate  Afenyo-Markin,"The Majority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin has confirmed that the majority caucus fully supports Dr Mahamudu Bawumia's decision to select Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh as his running mate for the upcoming December elections.


The confirmation comes following a private meeting between Afenyo-Markin and Dr Bawumia on Friday, June 28, held at the Vice President's residence.


The discussion centred on Dr Bawumia's choice of a running mate and its implications for their electoral strategy.


In an interview with Accra-based Citi FM, Afenyo-Markin emphasised the caucus's unanimous endorsement of Dr Bawumia's selection.


He noted that after Dr Bawumia informed the caucus of his decision, extensive consultations were held, leading to overwhelming support for the chosen candidate.




Mr Afenyo-Markin highlighted the confidence within the majority caucus regarding Dr Opoku Prempeh's capabilities and contributions, indicating a unified stance as they prepare for the upcoming political contest.


“Yes, the leader of our party and flagbearer met with the leadership of Parliament and had an extensive engagement with us, regarding the way forward for the party going into the 2024 elections.


“And then, the conclusion was that our respected colleague, Dr Mathew Opoku-Prempeh, is his choice for running mate. And that is normally the practice, and out of respect, the caucus would have to be informed and engaged about the decision.""


“After, I proceeded and engaged the caucus, and so far, the feedback has been positive. That the generality of the caucus members is in support of his choice. What is it is that for it to become official or confirmed, there’s going to be a national council meeting,"" he stated.

Profile of Eunice Asiedua Agyepong




Eunice Asiedua Agyepong is a young teacher who was initially posted to a non-existent school in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Despite her hopes of being close to her elderly parents, she found herself assigned to Noka, a town where no school existed. 


Undeterred by this unexpected challenge and the ridicule she faced from friends and colleagues, Ms Agyepong remained resolute in her determination to make a positive impact in the lives of children in the Noka community. 


With the support of the local community, she took the initiative to establish the school, initially starting with just seven pupils in a church building generously provided by a local pastor. 


Through her unwavering dedication, perseverance, and hard work, what was once a non-existent school has now transformed into a fully operational educational institution within the church premises. 




In just six months, the school's enrollment has grown to 125 pupils, and it now boasts nine trained teachers.

Heavy rains cause severe damage on Ho-Juapong road; motorists and travellers stranded,"A portion of the Ho-Juapong road has split into two after heavy rains flooded it, making it impassable.


According to reports, the incident was caused by the collapse of a culvert on the road.


The incident has left the main road flooded, with vehicles unable to use the stretch.





This has prompted local authorities to urge travellers from Ho, Hohoe, Kpando, and surrounding areas to use the Adidome-Sogakope-Accra road as an alternative route.





The damage to the Juapong stretch has raised safety concerns and could potentially disrupt transportation and logistics in the region.




Commuters and transport operators are advised to heed the warning to avoid delays and stay safe.





Authorities are assessing the extent of the damage and planning repair works.





In the meantime, motorists are encouraged to exercise caution and plan their journeys accordingly.


Frustrated passengers and residents expressed worry over the development and wished something was done about the situation immediately to avert any form of calamity.

Four die after drinking from bottles found in sea,"Four Sri Lankan fishermen have died and another two are critically ill after consuming an unknown liquid from bottles they found while at sea, according to local media reports.


The sailors were said to be on a fishing trip when they retrieved the bottles around 320 nautical miles from Tangalle, a town on the southern coast of the island.


The Sri Lanka Navy told reporters the fishermen had drunk from the bottles thinking they contained alcohol.


Director General of the Sri Lankan Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Susantha Kahawatte, told several outlets that the navy was attempting to bring them back to shore.


He reportedly said that the the navy was providing medical attention to the men aboard the fishing vessel - named the Devon - over concerns there was not enough time to return them to land for treatment.




The BBC has approached Mr Kahawatta and the Sri Lanka Navy for confirmation and comment.


Mr Kahawatta told national news station Ada Derana that the fishermen had distributed some of the bottles to other crews operating in the area.


He added that attempts to notify these crews were being made.


The navy told local media that the Devon was being towed back to shore by another vessel. It set off from Tangalle on 4 June.




The incident has reportedly prompted protests in the coastal town - located around 120 miles (193km) from the capital, Colombo - calling for the sailors who were still alive to be returned to land.


Authorities are now investigating the contents of the bottles.

President Ghazouani holds early lead as Mauritania counts votes,"Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani opened an early lead as vote counting was underway after Saturday's presidential election, provisional results from the country's electoral commission showed.


Ghazouani was leading with 49%, while his main rival, prominent anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, was at 22.68%, with around 6.49% of total votes counted, or 283 polling stations reporting out of 4,503 by 0010 GMT.


Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier who is widely expected to win, has pledged to boost investment to spur a commodities boom in the West African country of 5 million people, as it prepares to start producing natural gas.


""The last word belongs to the Mauritanian voters. I commit myself to respecting their choice,"" Ghazouani said after he voted in the capital early on Saturday.


Elected for a first term in 2019, Ghazouani is facing a field of six opponents, among them Abeid, who came second in 2019 with over 18% of the vote.




Other challengers include lawyer Id Mohameden M'Bareck, economist Mohamed Lemine El Mourtaji El Wafi, and Hamadi Sidi El Mokhtar of the Islamist Tewassoul party.


Casting his ballot soon after polls opened in the capital Nouakchott, 39-year-old geographer Mohamed Cheikh Hadrami said he had voted for a candidate ""who will be able to reconcile Mauritanians"". He declined to say who he had voted for.


Some 2 million people were registered to vote, with major election issues including fighting corruption and creating jobs for the young.


If re-elected, Ghazouani has promised a natural gas-fired power plant from the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin offshore gas project, which is on track to start production by the end of the year. He has also pledged to invest in renewable energy and expand gold, uranium and iron-ore mining.




Ghazouani has presided with relative stability since 2019, while Mauritania's Sahel neighbours, including Mali, struggle with Islamist insurgencies that have led to military coups.





Mauritania has not recorded a militant attack on its soil in recent years and Ghazouani, who chairs the African Union, has promised to manage Islamist threats.


Abeid is challenging Ghazouani on his human rights record and the marginalisation of Mauritania's Black African population, while El Mokhtar has a following among conservative and religious voters.


""President Ghazouani will likely win the vote in the first round,"" said Mucahid Durmaz, senior West Africa analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.




""The president's re-election bid has been boosted by the ruling party's landslide victory in legislative elections last year,"" he added.


If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the election will go to a second round.


In the last election, some opposition candidates questioned the credibility of the vote, sparking small-scale protests.


""Everything indicates that people want change. I will have no problem recognising the results of a transparent election, but in case of fraud we'll not hesitate to call it a rigged election,"" El Mokhtar said after voting.




El Mokhtar was third with 14.42% of the vote, according to the provisional results on Saturday.

Video director calls out Shatta Wale over alleged debt,"Renowned Nigerian filmmaker and video director, Sir Choppenson, has publicly accused dancehall king Shatta Wale of failing to settle outstanding payments for several video projects.


According to Sir Choppenson, he was commissioned to shoot multiple music videos for Shatta Wale, including the recent release ‘Killa Ji Mi’, filmed in Tamale.


Speaking out on social media, Sir Choppenson claimed that despite completing over 13 videos for Shatta Wale, including the one that caught international attention leading to a collaboration with Beyoncé, he has yet to receive full payment.





He stated that the agreed amount for recent shoots was less than $5,000, but Shatta Wale had promised $15,000, which remains unpaid.


“I have been begging for my money for over a month now,” Sir Choppenson lamented. “Every time I call, there are excuses or anger from Shatta Wale.”




The video director noted that he has made significant contributions to Shatta Wale’s career.


He expressed frustration over the delayed payments despite assurances from Shatta Wale’s management.


As of now, the self-acclaimed richest musician in Ghana, Shatta Wale, has not responded to the allegations publicly.

Man Enough: Fatherhood as a sacred responsibility every man is armed for,"Father’s Day is marked annually on the third Sunday of June in many countries across the world. It is a fitting occasion not only to celebrate the gift of our fathers (and husbands) but also to highlight some of the elements of the unique and sacred vocation of fatherhood. As men ourselves, we take this opportunity to celebrate fatherhood and to encourage our fellow men that, we are divinely equipped enough to accomplish what we have been called for.


The Source of Fatherhood


In many religious traditions, God the Almighty Creator is recognised as the Pre-eminent Father. God is the One to whom the title of Father truly belongs in an original and primary sense because God is the Source, the Creator and the Sustainer of the Universe. Human beings are only called fathers in a participatory, imitative and secondary sense, since in some way through procreation, human agents do partake in the generative process. From this point of view, the fatherhood vocation is a profound and inestimable privilege for the adult male. But this privilege comes with critical responsibilities that cannot be shirked on a wide scale without significant deleterious consequences for the entire society and for multiple generations.


For this article, by fatherhood, we refer to all men, fathers and fathers-to-be, biological and functional alike. Fatherhood is a profound phenomenon that calls for a great measure of accountability on those who knowingly assume the task or those who have the task foisted upon them by circumstances. Fatherhood is a function, and not simply a title or a name. The father is the primary provider, the guardian, the teacher, and the role model of those who call him father. He is the source of identity, and enables the children to have a definite sense of self.


Fatherhood is characterised by love and tenderness, but also discipline, decisiveness and sacrifice. Fathers ideally possess an innate instinct to prioritise the safety and well-being of the members of their families over their own. Fathers teach their children the value of hard work, responsibility,  integrity and perseverance. The father is the source of stability amid the chaos and uncertainties of life. Indeed, fatherhood is a godly enterprise. The vocation of fatherhood is an invitation to live out the human potential for responsibility, commitment, deferred gratification, courage, and sacrificial (selfless) love.




The State of Fatherhood


Yet, the number one crisis of the 21st Century appears to be the absence of the fatherhood role model. Many young people today are “fatherless,” not because they have no male parent alive, but because their male parent has either been completely absent from their lives, or they have been a source of scandal and trauma, and are remembered only with pain, regret, and resentment. Thus, often lacking models of positive masculinity to emulate in their growing years, many young men are today struggling with a variety of character defects that amount to negative masculinity, including the psycho-emotional abuse of their wives, actual physical battering, and remorseless infidelity. Many young men have little or no sense of commitment to their families or responsibility for the children they have brought into the world.


Many children have indeed had their innocent minds defiled and their delicate sensibilities assaulted, as they watched their fathers beat their mothers or heard them vomit venomous invectives on the ones they called their wives. While many young men struggle with what they saw in their formative years, and sometimes end up exhibiting the same traits of negative masculinity in their own marital relationships, many young women on the other hand, have grown up with deep-seated resentment and hateful feelings against the male species in general, on account of what they saw as gross injustices and inequities, or glaring imbalance in power relations between their fathers and their mothers. And it doesn’t help that in the effort to emancipate and affirm women and girls over the last half a century, positive masculinity has suffered both direct and collateral damage.


The global celebration of Father’s Day this year is a most fitting occasion to remind men to spare a moment to reflect on the enormous privilege and the sacred responsibility that come with fatherhood and to work towards overcoming the gross anomaly of toxic masculinity that contradicts all the lofty ideals of fatherhood outlined above. Far from being a bully, the husband who often doubles as father, is ideally “one who cultivates, nourishes, tills, and tends” the wife and the children. The male headship of families in our society is not something to be achieved through domination and coercion but through a high sense of responsibility, commitment, and sacrifice. Today, experts in the Christian Scriptures hold that even the allegedly controversial statement of St. Paul in Ephesians Chapter 5, that wives should be submissive to their husbands, is (in the context of the entire passage and in the context of the teachings of Christ), not an endorsement of any form of misogyny, to be expressed in psychological abuse, wife battering or domestic terrorism. Instead, the husband is admonished to love, cherish, and honour his wife.




The Supply of Fatherhood


While gender-based violence (and such) tends to be associated with males’ abuse of power, perceived or real, a concomitant but often missed cause of such negative masculinity actually comes from a place of inadequacy. Hurting people hurts people, and insecure people make others insecure too. Men who abuse others often do so from a place of feeling inferior or being too small in the head or heart to handle perceived or real threats to their person or towards what they care about. As we mark Father’s Day, we call on all men to know that they have all that is needed and have all that it takes for positive masculinity. You are enough, man enough! Abusing others doesn’t make you a man; it actually makes you less of a man. Even less of a human.


In encouraging men to rise to life’s challenges and to live out their God-given identity and purpose, the expression used in many contexts is “man up.” However, inherent in ‘manning up’ is the danger that one has to harness some ethereal resources and put forward a personality that is neither them nor theirs. We offer an alternative paradigm to ‘manning up’: man enough! You are man enough. Where you feel or fear a lack of wisdom or courage call to the ultimate source and intricate designer of fatherhood Himself: Father God. Being a good man isn’t just good for others, it is good for you.


Conclusion




Finally, recognising that many young men today have not had the good fortune of being raised or mentored by exemplary fatherhood role models, perhaps individuals and organisations, and especially religious groups, who are sufficiently invested in the promotion of positive masculinity for the wholesome development of our society, must begin to take on the project of healing our youths of their traumatic experiences with toxic masculinity while growing up, and forming the boys, particularly in the values and virtues of ideal fatherhood. Men, you are man enough. Happy Father’s Day.

Kwame claims that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's allegations of him stealing state land and being involved in a scheme to cheat Loic are entirely false and have significantly damaged his business and reputation.




Kwame questions why a lawmaker would publicly adjudicate a private dispute and cause public disaffection for one of the parties.


Second Lawsuit:Freddie Blay alleges that Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa's actions were motivated by malice, given the proximity to elections, and were aimed at ruining his hard-earned reputation. 


He asserts that the published information about his sons and his family is entirely false. 


Freddie also claims that Media General and Johnnie Hughes published untruths intended to tarnish his reputation. 




He highlights that Johnnie Hughes, on his show ""Johnnie's Bite,"" amplified Ablakwa's statements and denigrated him as if presenting factual information, further damaging his reputation.

"Boy, 13, shot dead by New York police had replica gun, authorities say","Police in New York state have shot dead a 13-year-old boy after he ran from police while holding a replica handgun, authorities said.


Officers stopped Nyah Mway and another 13-year-old on Friday night as the pair matched descriptions of suspects wanted for recent robberies in Utica, police said.


As the officers questioned the boys, Nyah Mway fled on foot and a chase ensued. Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said police spotted what ""appeared to be a handgun"".


One officer then wrestled the boy to the floor. “During a ground struggle”, another officer fired a single shot that hit the teenager in the chest, the police chief said.


He was given first aid at the scene but later died at Wynn Hospital.




Police released several minutes of body camera footage on Saturday night, from all the officers' cameras.


It came shortly after outraged members of the local community heckled the Utica police chief at a press conference, which was attended by the boy's family.


Utica Mayor Michael Galime called for calm, saying: ""We understand the weight of this situation and want to ensure that every single piece of this is understood.""


The footage appears to show the teenager pointing what police say was the replica weapon, while running away. The officers can be heard shouting ""gun!"" to each other.




The officers believed they had seen a real handgun, police said - but it was later determined to be a replica of a Glock 17 weapon that could only fire pellets or BB’s.


Police released an image of a replica handgun recovered from the scene


The three officers involved were on a patrol of the West Utica area assisting with two recent robbery investigations nearby.


In one of the incidents on 27 June, two men armed with a black firearm forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. The suspects were described as an Asian male and a dark-skinned male - one travelling by foot and one on a bicycle.


Authorities say they stopped Nyah Mway and the other teenager based on these ""identifying factors"" at around 22:00 local time.




The officers involved have been named as Patrick Husnay, who fired the fatal shot, Bryce Patterson and Andrew Citriniti. They have been placed on administrative leave.


The shooting is being investigated by both the New York attorney general's office and Utica police.

"Bodies of 2 children found dead at Kakpayili, suspected to have been killed for rituals","Two children have been found dead at Kakpayili in the Tamale metropolis of the Northern Region. 


The residents suspect that the children were murdered for ritual purposes, as their decomposed bodies were abandoned in a vehicle behind Mallam Madaha's house.


According to the Assemblyman for the Kakpayili Electoral area, Hafiz Andani, the two children, both aged three, went missing last Saturday. 


A search was conducted for the boys, but after two days of not finding them, an official complaint was made to the police.


""They went missing on the 22nd, so on the 25th, we reported the case to the police,"" Alhaji Hafiz said.




Alhaji Hafiz mentioned that some residents reported to the chief of the area that the two boys were last seen around Mallam Madaha's residence. 


Consequently, the chief invited Mallam Madaha to the GumaNaa palace for questioning. 


""Some of the residents said they saw the children around his house before they went missing, so the chief invited him to the palace,"" he said.


Mallam Madaha denied any knowledge of the crime, and his wife also denied the allegations. 




This denial triggered agitation among the residents, prompting the chief to call the police to escort Mallam Madaha to the police station. 


""The chief called in the police, who came and took him to the police station. However, my people heard him granting interviews this evening around 4, which triggered more agitation,"" Alhaji Hafiz added.


A search was conducted, and the two bodies were found in a car behind Mallam Madaha's house. 


The discovery of the bodies heightened the residents' anger, leading to the burning and vandalising of Mallam Madaha's house.




The assemblyman called on the police to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is served for the toddlers. 


""We are calling for justice for the boys. We don't want what happened to the Takoradi girls to repeat here. 


""We don't care who the person is, whether an opinion leader, political head, or whatever. What we want is justice,"" he said.

Cyprus and Ghana forge new path in trade and diplomacy,"Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Foreign Minister Dr. Konstantinos Kombos hosted meetings with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley A. Botchwey in Nicosia, establishing a framework for political consultations.


This framework aims to facilitate cooperation across various fields, including trade, maritime security, education, fisheries, tourism, and visa protocols.


During a meeting at the Cypriot foreign ministry headquarters, Ms Botchwey highlighted the opportunities presented by the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), headquartered in Ghana.





""We must explore trade opportunities between our two countries. I recommend a visit by a Cypriot business mission to Ghana to explore mutually beneficial opportunities under AfCFTA,"" she said.


The discussions also covered multilateral issues, including the United Nations and the future of the Commonwealth. 




Ms. Botchwey, with strong bipartisan support in Ghana, has offered to lead the 56-member organisation when Heads of Government meet to elect a new Secretary-General in October in Samoa.


Dr Kombos praised Ghana for its stance on international law during its tenure on the UN Security Council, which ended in 2023. 


""The Commonwealth is a powerful organization, but it needs a different outlook and a new approach to make it even more impactful,"" he said, noting the organization’s annual GDP of over $13 trillion.


Ms. Botchwey agreed, emphasizing, ""We must ensure that the wealth of the Commonwealth becomes common for all its members."" She advocated for the Commonwealth to support young people through skill training and financial backing for innovation and start-ups to counter illegal migration.







A prominent member of Ghana’s national security council and a leading African diplomat, Ms. Botchwey has made the future of young people in the Commonwealth a key pillar of her candidacy. 


Over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s 2.6 billion people are under thirty years old.


President Christodoulides expressed Cyprus' support for Ms Botchwey’s vision for the Commonwealth, which includes boosting trade and investment within the organisation and addressing the economic impact of climate change on vulnerable Small Island Developing States and Small States, mainly in the Caribbean and the Pacific.


Currently, trade between Ghana and Cyprus is limited, at $1.8 million as of 2022. 




However, the A.G. Leventis Foundation, an offshoot of a former corporate organization in Ghana, funds wildlife conservation through the Ghana Wildlife Society and supports youth in agriculture via the University of Ghana and related research centres.

Murray wants Wimbledon closure as fitness race goes on,"Britain's Andy Murray says he is fighting to be fit for Wimbledon because he wants ""a bit of closure"" at the All England Club before retiring later this year.


The two-time champion, 37, does not plan to play much past the summer and his preparations for a Wimbledon farewell have been dented by a back issue, which required surgery.


Murray says he will decide on ""Monday evening"" whether he will play in the singles.


The world number 115 is due to play Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic on Tuesday.


""I don't think there's one thing that I'm hoping for. When it comes to the end, I don't know, maybe a bit of closure,"" said Murray, who won Wimbledon in 2013 and 2016.




""I just want the opportunity to play one more time out there, hopefully on Centre Court, and feel that buzz.


""Last year, I wasn't planning on it being my last year on the tour. I wanted to come back and play again, whereas this year I have no plans to do that.""


If Murray does not play singles, the Scot might still be fit enough to take part in the doubles alongside older brother Jamie later next week.


Murray had a cyst close to his spinal cord removed eight days ago because it was causing nerve pain in his right leg.




The former world number one says the area where he had the operation is not sore, but still does not have 100% feeling in his leg.


After hitting at Wimbledon on Saturday for the first time since the procedure, Murray returned to the practice courts on Sunday and played a practice set with fellow Briton Jack Pinnington-Jones.


""It's getting better every single day. I want to give it every single chance that I can to get there,"" said Murray.


""I'm going to play another set again tomorrow. I'm doing some physical testing in the morning to see how far off I am from a physical perspective.




""Then I will probably make a decision tomorrow evening after that.""

Excited Alcaraz opens Centre Court at Wimbledon,"Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz says it feels ""more special"" to return to Wimbledon as he prepares to open play on Centre Court when the tournament starts on Monday.


Spain's Alcaraz, now 21, beat seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in last year's final, despite it being only his fourth grass-court tournament.


Tradition dictates the reigning men's champion starts his defence in the first match on Centre Court.


Therefore, third seed Alcaraz meets Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal at 13:30 BST on the iconic show court.


""I always say it is great to be back here at Wimbledon. It is more special to be the defending champion,"" said Alcaraz, who arrives on the back of winning the third major of his career at the French Open.




""Great memories last year, great run. I'm excited to start the tournament and hopefully have the same result as last year.""


Raducanu leads Brits on day one


Britain's Emma Raducanu makes her return to Wimbledon in the second match of day one on Centre Court.


Raducanu, 21, missed last year's tournament through injury and faces Russian 22nd seed Ekaterina Alexandrova at about 16:00 BST.


""I think it's a tough match. She's got great weapons. On this surface, on grass, it only amplifies big weapons,"" said Raducanu, who is ranked 135th in the world and was given a wildcard to play.




""I'm expecting a really difficult match. I think it's a match where I'm actually the complete underdog because she's a lot older, a lot more experienced, ranked a lot higher.


""For me, I feel like it's just a great opportunity to try to get a good scalp, try to enjoy playing how I have been in the last few weeks, and just get back into it.""


Reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff plays the third scheduled singles match on Centre Court, with the 20-year-old facing fellow American Caroline Dolehide.


Raducanu is one of seven British singles players in action on Monday.




Wildcard Charles Broom makes his Wimbledon debut when he faces three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, with the pair playing on Court Two at about 14:00 BST.


""It's a good draw I think. I'm just excited,"" said 26-year-old Broom.


""Stan's pretty amazing, he's a tennis legend really.


""I'm going to go in there with no expectations and try and play my game, do the best I can, and just enjoy it as much as possible.""




Wildcards Heather Watson, Liam Broady, Arthur Fery and Lily Miyazaki are also in action, along with Sonay Kartal after she came through qualifying.

"Suspected suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria, authorities say","At least 18 people were killed and 30 others injured after a series of attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern Borno state on Saturday, the head of the local state emergency management agency said.


Borno is at the centre of a 15-year Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more. Although the Nigerian military has degraded the capabilities of the militants, they still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and security targets.


Barkindo Saidu, director general of the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, said suspected suicide bombers separately attacked a wedding, funeral and hospital, killing and injuring several people in the town of Gwoza.


Saidu said 18 deaths had been confirmed, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. 


""The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures, skull fractures, and limb fractures,"" he said.




No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.


Borno state police were not immediately available for comment.


Boko Haram and its splinter group, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), are the most active militant groups in Borno, a large swathe of rural hinterland the size of Ireland.

ACTT celebrates milestone with first graduates and launch of Innovative Woodwork Program,"The African Centre for Technical Training (ACTT) in Ghana celebrated a significant milestone with its inaugural graduation ceremony, which also marked the launch of its modern Woodwork & Joinery program. 


This event gathered key industry stakeholders and development organizations, including the Delegation of German Industry and Commerce in Ghana (AHK Ghana), Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Geberit Global, the Institution of Engineering and Technology Ghana (IET-Ghana), GIZ, University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC), and Furnart Ghana.


Under the theme “Empowering Future Craftsmen, Celebrating Achievement and Innovation in Woodwork,” ACTT graduated 16 professional plumbers. 


These graduates not only acquired hands-on technical skills but also emphasised soft skills and industry apprenticeships through the Plumbing Systems Design program. 





They were awarded Certificates of Competence from ACTT and C-Certificates (Local Dual Training with Elements from the German System) from AHK Ghana. 




Two trainees showcased their project on an Aggregate-Based Water Filtration System for Oil and Debris Removal, underscoring themes of water conservation, reuse, and sustainability.


Awards for exemplary leadership were presented to three trainees: Emmanuel Edem King-Gator for Most Disciplined, Ishmael Lamptey for Most Innovative and Entrepreneurial, and Isaac Frimpong Gyamfi, who received the Overall Best Trainee Award sponsored by Bosch Ghana.


Keynote speaker, Samuel D. Amegayibor, Executive Director of GREDA and Sector Skills Body Chairperson for Construction, highlighted the industry’s struggle with a shortage of skilled personnel, often necessitating labour importation from neighbouring countries. 


He urged graduates to master their competencies and leverage information technology for ongoing professional development.




Miss Penelope Brooke Thompson, Founder & President of ACTT, introduced the guests to the new Woodwork & Joinery program funded by Unorthodox Philanthropy. 


She emphasised the program’s potential impact on reducing imports, creating employment opportunities, and alleviating poverty among marginalized groups.


ACTT’s mission is to address the critical technical skills gap across various industries by offering a wide range of high-quality technical and vocational training programs, artisan certification, mentorship initiatives, and job placement opportunities. 


Training sessions begin in July, October, January, and April each year, with flexible weekday or weekend options.
